hyenia.1.t:0 "The War To Come"
hyenia.1.d:0 "The Storm King lies dead in the north and Yeti authority has collapsed. The Dervishes, last and most driven in the battle to liberate the Hyenian homelands, have seized upon this opportunity and are readying themselves for the greatest offensive they ever have committed. The inner circle of Fahamka’s trusted advisors and generals has convened to debate how to carry this out. Until now, the Dervishes focused on guerilla warfare and subterfuge, making the most of their limited resources. Now, with the end of the war in sight, their ranks swell by the thousands, and they may well be able to break the Yetis in open battle.\n\n"The subterfuge we have employed until this moment has served us well," silent Masaska said calmly."However numerous we are, the challenge before us is monumental. We must play to our strengths instead of being seduced by fantasies of grand battles." \n\n"And so we shall!" Furasho, warmaster and son of warmasters, boomed. "Yet beyond the war lies peace, and in that peace we will be the sole uniting force in Hyenia. Shall we cast aside this unity, so hard won in blood? No, we must not, and our unity was built on the battlefield. Hyenia must be baptized in fire, as we were."\n\n"There will be time to build unity without the death of countless." Masaska retorted. "The hyenas you speak of are not dervishes, and their lives are not for us to throw away in order to trick them into obedience."\n\n"Yet Dervishes they must become! Ours is the new order of the land, and we must seize it to recast this nation so that we can stand firmly at its helm."\n\n"That sounds like the words of a would-be king," Masaska remarked sweetly, leaving Furasho to growl and Fahamka to rise from her seat.\n\n"Enough,” she said, both falling silent at the first syllable. “I have heard enough...""
hyenia.1.a:0 ""Masaska is right, we are warriors of shadow, not pretender kings.""
hyenia.1.b:0 ""Furasho is right, let our unconvinced kin see the truth in battle.""

hyenia.2.t:0 "Time is Inexorable and Pitiless"
hyenia.2.d:0 "As the Dervishes stand at the brink of their greatest trial, another, more insidious, enemy has advanced upon them: time.\n\nEven before the Storm King's invasion, Fahamka - the Great Teacher - lived a hard life. First she was an exile deep in the deserts before she found enlightenment. Then she was the wandering teacher of a marginalized and ridiculed philosophy. In a way, the trials of war are merely the peak of the trials and tribulations she has known for decades at this point.\n\nMore and more however, she has been feeling her strength slipping away from her. Pure determination - some might even call it spite - has kept her going for years at this point, but no dog is eternal. Fahamka has been forced to retreat more and more from the duties of leadership. Ever the stoic, she has refused to let this show, but Furasho and Masaska both know their teacher too well to avoid it, and both are starting to worry." 
hyenia.2.a:0 "Soon she will no longer be with us..."

hyenia.3.t:0 "Dervish Sabotage!"
hyenia.3.d:0 "The Hyenian resistance has struck again. Their "dervishes" have snuck past the borders and struck across the nation, causing widespread damage and chaos. Little seems sacred to these desert savages, and the damage they have caused will take a lot of time to restore."
hyenia.3.a:0 "Damn them all!"

hyenia.4.t:0 "Peace with the Hyenas?" #Peace with the Hyenas?
hyenia.4.d:0 "We are trapped in a two front war; one front against the other successors to the Storm King, and the other against the Hyenian zealots. As it stands, we are hard pressed, and  desperate times means formerly unthinkable solutions must be considered. Between our two enemies, the Hyenas are less interested in our destruction and more in reclaiming the lands we took from them. While it would mean giving up a lot of territory and industrial capability, it would mean that we would have only one front to focus on. When we unite the Storm Kingdom again, we can return to deal with the hyenas at a later date."
hyenia.4.a:0 "We can not fight two wars at once"
hyenia.4.b:0 "We will not give up what we won rightfully!"

hyenia.5.t:0 "The Yetis Surrender" #Yetis Surrender!
hyenia.5.d:0 "Buckling under the onslaught of our assault, the Yetis have sent envoys to negotiate for peace. They know the position they are in, and are willing to yield the entirety of our homelands back to us. There is no reason for us to not accept this. It is over, and we can return home."
hyenia.5.a:0 "Hurrah!"

hyenia.6.t:0 "The Yetis Refuse to Surrender." #The Yetis fight on!
hyenia.6.d:0 "Though we have pressed them hard, the Yetis are determined to hold onto their stolen lands. Blood flows in rivers already, yet they fight as though they actually have something to fight for. This war will only end when they are utterly destroyed it seems. So be it: If death is all they understand, the dervishes will provide."
hyenia.6.a:0 ""

hyenia.7.t:0 "Hyenian Ultimatum" #Hyenian Ultimatum to [INSERT COUNTRY HERE] for Thunderbowl
hyenia.7.d:0 "Though the Thundarians have been crushed by our victorious armies, we have been left with another headache. The Hyenas who once inhabited these lands have not gone away, and instead they have united in their quest to reclaim their homeland, parts of which we now hold. The question is whether we are going to attempt to hold onto it, and divide precious manpower to hold back the Hyenas while there is still a civil war to win."
hyenia.7.a:0 "It's not worth it."
hyenia.7.b:0 "If they want it, they can try to take it."

hyenia.8.t:0 "[thunderbowl_owner.GetName] Refuses to Comply" #Not Returning our lands? War.
hyenia.8.d:0 "Though we hoped to avoid further bloodshed, the [thunderbowl_owner.GetName] are not as keen. They are determined to hold onto their stolen lands, just like the Thundarians before them. Thus, the war must continue, and the [thunderbowl_owner.GetName] will regret not taking our offer."
hyenia.8.a:0 "War it is."

hyenia.9.t:0 "Her Only Mother" #His Only Mother
hyenia.9.d:0 "Masaska quietly gave the bowl of water to Fahamka, silently sitting by her bedside as the old hyena drank from it. When Fahamka was done, Masaska gently took it from her when she was finished. Over half of it was still there. Even merely drinking was becoming an issue for Fahamka. The visage that had betrayed only strength and conviction was marked by age and weariness.\n\n"Do not look so despondent, little ferret,"" Fahamka cautioned her gently, her once strong voice a whisper. "You are not yet old enough for such furrows in your face."\n\n"Neither should you be," Masaska responded quietly, her face a study of sorrow, worry and fear.\n\n"And yet, I am,"" Fahamka sighed, leaning back in her bed. "It is the way of things," she said as she squeezed Masaska's paw in hers, "Surely you understood even before this that I was not eternal?"\n\n"The mind did, but not the heart," Masaska confessed, her head bowed. "When you found me, I was a shadow roaming a burning village. But without light there are no shadows, only darkness. I am afraid... I know it is our duty to let go of the past, but when you are gone, I do not know how I can move on.\n\n"Oh little ferret,"" Fahamka sighed. "A hyena, dervish or not, can still cry if she is sad. Cry for me, mourn and rail against this cruel, uncaring world, just promise me that you will rise again. Your heart is purer than you know, your wisdom is deep, and you are not without light of your own. When I am gone, promise me that you will be for others what I was for you. Promise me you will be a light in the dark.""
hyenia.9.a:0 "I promise."

hyenia.10.t:0 "The Fading Queen of War" #Fading Queen of War
hyenia.10.d:0 ""Why do you insist on carrying such shame?"" Fahamka asked Furasho where she sat in front of him. A board game stood between them, courtesy of the latter. He had brought it, hoping for a game that would either see him win against her for the first time, or give Fahamka a full hundred victories. The old female could see through his reasons for being here though, sniffing out the truth beneath.\n\nIn response to her question, Furasho bowed his head where he sat. "My father failed the last king of Hyenia," he murmured, "and it seems I am cursed to follow his path. I learned nothing from his failure, and though I swore to bring you back home,  it seems I can only repeat his failure."\n\n"You will carry our people home Furasho, and that must be enough,” Fahamka chided him. “Do not hang your faith and hopes on one hyena, for that is all I am."\n\n"One hyena can be everything, and without her, all hyenas nothing," Furasho muttered. "The finest smith in the world cannot forge great things out of waste iron, and good steel is wasted in the hands of a fool."\n\n"Then become such a smith," Fahamka told him. “Instead of sitting and crying at my grave, forge this nation in my absence. You carried our struggle further than I could have on my own. Yes, maybe me being eternal, akin to the queen of the ponies beyond the northern seas, would have helped you, but perfect is the enemy of good. Surely you see that, oh warmaster," she smiled, moving her piece to finish the match, winning her hundredth victory. 
hyenia.10.a:0 "Again, I am humbled."

hyenia.11.t:0 "Stormbreakers" #Stormbreakers
hyenia.11.d:0 "Furasho’s strategy has been given Fahamka’s approval, and across the Hyenian deserts, be it by propaganda and calls to actions or mandatory conscription, new formations of Hyenas are being rallied and armed, with everyone not mustered being instead put to work to feed the army that is rising for the battle ahead.\n\nThe Dervishes, who never numbered more than a couple dozen thousand, are dispersed among the ranks to act as the champions and the leaders of these new armies, drilling the soldiers in shooting and marching as much as instilling the principles of Fahamka’s Qaylid in them.\n\nThey are rag-tag and ill disciplined compared to the dervishes that lead them, but these warpups can march and shoot, they are spoiling for revenge and with the right leadership they will fight stubbornly. What's more, as they fight and die, surging in behind the Dervish spearheads through the Yeti lines and into the tunnels of our ancestral homes, they will find kinship and unity under the banner of the Qaylid. Every warpup that dies here is a hero twice over, for not only do they die for our homes, but their deaths become the mortar binding our people together."
hyenia.11.a:0 "In fire and death, we become one."

hyenia.12.t:0 "Shadowdancers" #Shadowdancers
hyenia.12.d:0 "Masaska’s warning have been heeded, and the Dervishes who carried on the struggle will be the ones to finish it as well. The refugees and the impoverished have lost enough without seeing their children, siblings and parents forcibly dragged into war.  None who freely wishes to fight is turned away, but none is dragged into battle like a slave.\n\nMaintaining the integrity of their original formations, the Dervishes can move like shadows through the enemy lines. Entire divisions are rising in the mountains to wreak havoc on the occupiers’ supply lines and communications and block their routes of escape. In the end, the swift shadow warfare of the Dervishes are leaving them surrounded and ready to be cut into pieces.\n\nWith only a few extra divisions gathered for the struggle ahead, the pace set by our forces must be set high, indeed blinding, and none but the dervishes could truly maintain it for as long as needed. With the hardened veterans of years of war carrying on the fight, it can be done though, and those who wait in the desert shall see the Dervishes’ mettle in the days and weeks ahead. They will see heroes and paragons, and they will know that even in the last days, the Dervishes were neither slavers nor tyrants, but protectors and teachers."
