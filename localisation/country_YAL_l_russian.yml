 ###INDUSTRY###
 YAL_subsidize_industry:0 "Субсидировать промышленность"
 YAL_subsidize_industry_desc:0 "Хотя некоторые из наших более радикальных экономистов презирают любое вмешательство государства в экономику, анализ показали, что от субсидирования наших отраслей можно извлечь немало пользы. Несколько инвестиций в ключевые отрасли позволяет внедрить новые методы производства, что даст нашим фабрикам преимущество перед иностранными конкурентами."

 YAL_yale_factories:0 "Оживить Йель"
 YAL_yale_factories_desc:0 "Йель, старую столицу и тёзку [YAL.GetNameDef], медленно, но верно затмил Гринбэк. Тем не менее, город находится в стратегически важном месте, отлично подходящим как для торговли, так и для развития промышленности. Инвестиции в Йельский университет могут позволить городу вернуть былое великолепие."

 YAL_greenback_factories:0 "Инвестиции в столицу"
 YAL_greenback_factories_desc:0 "Гринбэк - это сердце [YAL.GetNameDef] с самого начала промышленной революции. Многие из старых городов в Грифонии растеряли свою былую славу, и их место заняли новые центры промышленности и культуры. Поскольку город уже является домом наших самых важных компаний, мы должны стимулировать их расширять производство в городе."

 YAL_develop_yale_ironworks:0 "Металлургический завод в Йеле"
 YAL_develop_yale_ironworks_desc:0 "Промышленность Йеля растёт, но эти новые заводы создают свои собственные новые требования. Сталь - это ключ к тяжелой промышленности и будет разумно создать металлургический завод в нашей стране. Непрерывный поток стали, несомненно, лишь поможет развитию промышленности."

 YAL_tungsten_production:0 "Открытая добыча вольфрама"
 YAL_tungsten_production_desc:0 "Вольфрам обычно добывают на небольших подземных участках. Однако, открытый вольфрамовый рудник будет означать более интенсивную добычу этого металла, столько необходимого для современных артиллерийских орудий. Конечно, вид будет не самым живописным, но местные жители наверняка обрадуются дополнительным рабочим местам."

 YAL_develop_greenback_ironworks:0 "Гринбэкская сталь"
 YAL_develop_greenback_ironworks_desc:0 "Оружие, машины и многие другие товары изготавливаются из стали. Нам повезло, что в наших границах достаточно шахт, чтобы снабжать заводы столь необходимой рудой. Тем не менее, наш объем производства стали может быть ещё увеличен, если финансировать строительство ещё одного сталелитейного завода в столице."

 YAL_aluminium_production:0 "Производство алюминия"
 YAL_aluminium_production_desc:0 "Хотя сталь по-прежнему основа тяжелой промышленности, алюминий необходим для некоторых высокотехнологичных вещей вроде самолётов. При должных инвестициях в производство алюминия, наша промышленность будет готова к требованиям будущего."

 YAL_yale_infrastructure:0 "Йельские Шоссе"
 YAL_yale_infrastructure_desc:0 "Инфраструктурой Йеля пренебрегали годами, так как в этом районе не было промышленности Гринбэка. Крайне важно, чтобы Йель был должным образом интегрирован в нашу транспортную сеть, ведь юго-запад также должен быть открыт для будущего промышленного развития."

 YAL_frontline_infrastructure:0 "Рельсы на север"
 YAL_frontline_infrastructure_desc:0 "Большая часть торговли с Гриффенхеймом велась через реку, и, следовательно, города на севере страны были лишены инвестиций в автомагистрали и железные дороги. Империя становится все более нестабильной, так что именно стратегические, а не экономические интересы заставляют нас соединить север со столицей."

 YAL_greenback_infrastructure:0 "Первая Станция"
 YAL_greenback_infrastructure_desc:0 "Наша железнодорожная сеть проектировалась с опорой на Гринбэк с тех пор, как были проложены первые рельсы. Здание вокзала, шедевр поздне-имперской архитектуры в столице, имеет название Первая Станция среди рабочих железнодорожного транспорта, является центром грузовых и пассажирских перевозок. Настало время удвоить ставки и расширить Первую Станцию новыми платформами и складами."

 ###Society### 
 YAL_educational_effort:0 "Модернизировать учебные планы"
 YAL_educational_effort_desc:0 "Скорость, с которой прогрессирует наука, увеличивается с каждым днём, оставляя позади грифонов из менее везучих стран. Тем не менее, университеты должны продолжать поддерживать постоянный поток студентов из молодого поколения. Чтобы дать им наибольший шанс на успех, мы должны обновить учебный план, чтобы убрать из него устаревшие знания и опровергнутые теории."

 YAL_bank_reform:0 "Пересмотреть банковские законы"
 YAL_bank_reform_desc:0 "Банковское дело - давняя традиция всего Герцланда, но законы, которыми руководствуются эти банкиры, не особо прозрачны. Мы предложим нашим старшим преподавателям права написать новый "Закон о банковской деятельности", который будет благоприятствовать нашей стране, а не этим транснациональным банкирам. Даже сторонники невмешательства среди банкиров согласны с тем, что закон должен защищать от порочных стимулов, и делать экономику устойчивой к внезапным кризисам."

 YAL_public_schools:0 "Обновление государственных школ"
 YAL_public_schools_desc:0 "Поскольку большая часть бюджета, выделяемого на образование, направляется в университеты, наши государственные школы остаются в стороне. Им нужно почти всё: новые классные комнаты, учебники и даже работающее отопление, чтобы нашим птенцам не приходилось сидеть в классе в двух зимних пальто. Мы должны поддерживать наши таланты!"

 YAL_land_reform:0 "Консолидация земель"
 YAL_land_reform_desc:0 "Эпоха феодализма оставила свой след на нашей стране, как и на большей части Грифонии. Браки, древние контракты и междоусобицы превратили сельскую местность в путаницу из ферм и полей, принадлежащих мелким фермерам и большим имениям. Поощряя консолидацию земель, когда фермеры обменивают свои земли на более эффективные и большие поля, мы обеспечим процветание сельскохозяйственного сектора."

 YAL_agricultural_studies:0 "Наука о сельском хозяйстве"
 YAL_agricultural_studies_desc:0 "Сельскохозяйственные исследования - не самая престижная область науки, но она быстро развивается. Теории рационального управления и успехи в областях биологии и органической химии наряду с механизированными инструментами имеют первостепенное значение в деле увеличения производства продуктов питания. Давайте вспомним, что избыток продовольствия был двигателем роста цивилизаций с незапамятных времен."

 YAL_universal_education:0 "Универсальное образование"
 YAL_universal_education_desc:0 "Не каждый грифон в нашей стране имеет внутреннюю мотивацию, которая привлекает столь многих к поиску знаний. Фактически, многие грифоны в сельской местности отказываются отправлять своих птенцов в школу, предпочитая, чтобы те работали на земле. Обязательное образование - это необходимое изменение, благодаря которому каждый талантливый грифон попадёт в священные залы нашего университета!"

 YAL_gold_standard:0 "Принять золотой стандарт"
 YAL_gold_standard_desc:0 "Когда Империя правила Грифонией, никто не сомневался в стабильности ее валюты. Теперь, когда железная вера в Гриффенхей - всего лишь сноска в учебниках истории, нам потребуется нечто новое. Привязав нашу валюту к золоту, мы сделаем её курс стабильным, поскольку ни один грифон не будет сомневаться в ценности самого драгоценного металла!"

 YAL_industrial_breakthrough:0 "Методы нового тысячелетия"
 YAL_industrial_breakthrough_desc:0 "Наша промышленность отстаёт от науки из-за недостаточных инвестиций в НИОКР от наших компаниями. Если мы хотим перенести промышленность во второе тысячелетие, государство должно вмешаться, инвестируя в модернизацию промышленности. Наука сделает так, чтобы наши заводы производили больше товаров с меньшими затратами!"

 YAL_yale_university:0 "Расширить Йельский университет"
 YAL_yale_university_desc:0 "Йельский университет - старейший и самый престижный университет в стране, но, как и город, в котором он находится, институт затмила современность. Тем не менее, его обширная библиотека и традиции мастерства требуют ещё инвестиций. Мы должны поручить опытному архитектору построить новое крыло для старого университета, чтобы Йельский университет мог использовать его для достижения новых высот!"

 YAL_focused_research:0 "Программа исследований"
 YAL_focused_research_desc:0 "Наши лаборатории, ученые и другие исследовательские учреждения готовы к следующему шагу, чтобы раздвинуть границы грифоньих знаний. С помощью программы исследований, правительство поставит цель на 200 дней. В это время все университеты сосредоточат свое внимание на изучении конкретной области науки, чтобы обеспечить немедленную пользу для народа и страны."

 YAL_the_great_yale_archives:0 "Большие Йельские архивы"
 YAL_the_great_yale_archives_desc:0 "Бориан Видергрейфф был одновременно и провидцем, и грифоном, работавшим над сохранением наших знаний. Он отвечает за многие реформы, благодаря которым Йельский университет стал тем, чем он является сегодня, но он никогда не думал, что дело его жизни будет окончено. Огромный архив, содержащий все мировые знания. Строительство этого тщательно продуманного здания будет непростой задачей, но действительно достойным проектом для его наследников."

 YAL_send_invitations:0 "Пригласить лучшие умы Грифонии"
 YAL_send_invitations_desc:0 "Бориан Видергрейф предполагал, что его архивы помогут установить мир среди грифонов континента, став местом встречи научной элиты и маяком, рассеивающим тьму невежества, которое, по его мнению, приводило к войне. Закончив архивы, мы должны пригласить лучших учёных-грифонов всех стран учиться в Йельских архивах. Пусть наука приведет к взаимопониманию между избранными Бореаса."

 YAL_learn_from_the_past:0 "Сокровища прошлого"
 YAL_learn_from_the_past_desc:0 "Война, невежество и злоба уничтожили большую часть знаний древней Империи Грифонов. Архивы помогают историкам и другим исследователям собрать воедино знания прошлого. Многие знания древних могут быть устаревшими, но иногда они кажутся намного мудрее, чем мы могли себе представить."

 ###Internal Politics###
 ##Fascism##
 YAL_gather_the_council:0 "Gather the Council"
 YAL_gather_the_council_desc:0 "With the situation in Griffenheim turning increasingly more volatile, we must gather the Council of Rectors to plan out a new course for [YAL.GetNameDef]. The death of the Emperor and the choice of a new regent has shattered what remained of imperial unity. Desperate times call for desperate measures, so perhaps it is time to listen to some of the country’s more radical minds."
 
 YAL_bruma_and_gamia:0 "Bruma and Gamia"
 YAL_bruma_and_gamia_desc:0 "In the west of Yale lie the two university cities of Bruma and Gamia. These universities maintain close ties with the nearby Eyr Archonate seated in Romau and have become a brooding place for radicalism. Gamia houses brilliant biologists who dare to push beyond the boundaries of the ethical. The Bruma social science faculty, meanwhile, rejects liberal theories about society in favour of a communal system."

 YAL_archons_patronage:0 "The Archons’ Patronage"
 YAL_archons_patronage_desc:0 "The Archons are delighted that Yale has chosen to favour the university of Bruma. To promote Bruma’s traditionalist theories in the rest of Yale, they have chosen to increase their investments into our country, increasing the church’s control of the education system in particular. With the Archon’s Patronage, our country will rise to greatness. "

 YAL_additional_funding:0 "Charitas"
 YAL_additional_funding_desc:0 "Although the role of charity in griffon society is often debated and disputed, a charm offensive by the church would smooth out tensions in Yale. Many commoners question the renewed prevalence of religion in our society, but if we can show the best side of the church, their concerns will melt like dew in the sun."

 YAL_archons_visit:0 "Plan the Archon’s Visit"
 YAL_archons_visit_desc:0 "His Holiness Archon Eros VII is the embodiment of the traditional values that will save Yale from the culture-destroying ideologies of republicanism and socialism. However, some of the people still doubt the benevolent intent of the voice of Boreas. A visit by the Archon will remind the griffons of Yale how Boreas would want us to live."

 YAL_social_sciences:0 "Bruma’s Social Sciences"
 YAL_social_sciences_desc:0 "The university of Bruma is an exception amongst universities. The faculty for social sciences rejects the universalist ideologies of harmony and socialism as Equestrian attempts to export their way of life. According to the professors of Bruma, if Yale is to weather the coming storm, we must return to our past and look for guidance in our own culture."

 YAL_indoctrinate_students:0 "Indoctrinate Students"
 YAL_indoctrinate_students_desc:0 "University students are interesting griffons. They have learned so little, yet they think they understand so much. The student body of Bruma already knows their place, working tirelessly to improve Yalian society. It is time to discipline these lazy, good for nothing young griffons into birds Boreas can be proud of."

 YAL_address_population:0 "Local Ethics"
 YAL_address_population_desc:0 "Many of our academics have grown too detached from the real world and the normal people. Let us return to them and learn from the people. The answer to what a just society is cannot be found in any book from Equestrian philosophers. The answer is out there, in the street. We have but to go a-looking. "

 YAL_common_cause:0 "The Common Cause"
 YAL_common_cause_desc:0 "Now that everygriffon in our country is in agreement with the importance of incorporating our culture into government, we can work on the task at hand. More government discretion will be needed to make sure this works and several rights will have to be temporarily restricted to ensure that the process of pursuing the common cause proceeds smoothly."

 YAL_new_council_member:0 "A New Council Member"
 YAL_new_council_member_desc:0 "To ensure an easy advantage for Bruma and Gamia in the Council of Rectors, we will need another vote. We will have our allies in the church convince the people that the Council requires religious guidance. With this pressure, we will be able to push for a new member; the Prelate of the Yaledom."

 YAL_crackdown_on_dissenters:0 "Silence!"
 YAL_crackdown_on_dissenters_desc:0 "With the Prelate of Yaledom now being one of the most powerful griffons in the country, many voices say that is a betrayal of the ideals of our nation. We cannot have these griffons organize and bundle their strength against us. We must silence these voices. Forcefully."

 YAL_offer_compromise:0 "Calm the Voices of Dissent"
 YAL_offer_compromise_desc:0 "The Prelate’s ascend to the Council has caused many concerns amongst student and professor alike. With compromises, flattery and bribes, we will be able to calm the situation down. It is worth the effort if every Yalian wholeheartedly supports us in the long run."

 YAL_challenge_griffenheim:0 "Challenge Griffenheim!"
 YAL_challenge_griffenheim_desc:0 "The foolish Griffenheim nobility have forced out the Archon of Boreas. Without him as the regent, who knows what corruption these nobles may force into the head of Grover VI. It is time to restore the church before Griffenheim unleashes disaster upon us all."

 YAL_stabilize_council:0 "Stabilise the Council"
 YAL_stabilize_council_desc:0 "The Council of Rectors has a hard time agreeing on anything, with griffons like the Rector of Cyrusval in it. With our newfound power, it is time to make sure the council no longer blocks our efforts to return Yale to its best possible form. They will bend, or they will break."

 YAL_cooperation_offer:0 "Into the Fold"
 YAL_cooperation_offer_desc:0 "Archon Eros VII has rightfully been appointed regent of the Empire. With him leading the faithful, a new era is sure to follow. That leaves us with a question for our own land. What purpose will Yale have in this new order? Perhaps Boreas has a use for us yet."

 YAL_biological_sciences:0 "The Science of Life"
 YAL_biological_sciences_desc:0 "Gamia is known for its biology department. While most universities have codes of conduct that restrict their attempts to conduct experiments on the living, this university is dedicated to a pure form of knowledge acquisition. Now, nothing will hold Gamia’s biologists back."

 YAL_initiate_research:0 "Unlimited Potential"
 YAL_initiate_research_desc:0 "With Yale quickly turning away from conventional ethics, there is an opportunity to remove the last obstacles to scientific progress. By altering guidelines and regulations that bar unlimited experimentation, our full potential will finally be unlocked."

 YAL_griffon_biology:0 "Griffon Biology"
 YAL_griffon_biology_desc:0 "We must begin our research at the basis. The griffon body. A unique blend of several different types of animals, it is clear that the griffon has adapted to a level of complexity beyond anything else on this planet. Some griffons even have some potential for certain types of magic, further proving our superiority."

 YAL_encourage_student_research:0 "Encourage Student Research"
 YAL_encourage_student_research_desc:0 "The students, especially the younger ones, are still a bit weary of going along with our methods. However, there is much potential in Gamia and we must encourage these griffons to let go of any ‘morality’ they got taught outside these walls. Progress is the ultimate goal."

 YAL_delve_deeper:0 "Delve Deeper"
 YAL_delve_deeper_desc:0 "Our research is expanding our fields of vision and the future is becoming ever clearer. The griffon body and its energy, divine essence, life itself. These are not, should not, be the domain of just the Gods. Understanding and manipulating these essential concepts is within our reach. It won’t be much longer now. . ."

 YAL_project_auferstehung:0 "Project Auferstehung"
 YAL_project_auferstehung_desc:0 "Life, as it is commonly understood, is an ending process. However, science may yet pierce the veil that separates the living from the death and retrieve a soul lost to our world. Imagine the implications!"

 YAL_project_weihe:0 "Project Weihe"
 YAL_project_weihe_desc:0 "Objectively, the Gods hold the most knowledge about the world and therefore, their instructions should be followed. However, the great distance between us and the heavens has made their word unclear and up to interpretation. What if we could retrieve this information directly at the source?"

 YAL_project_wohlstand:0 "Project Wohlstand"
 YAL_project_wohlstand_desc:0 "The world is run by a very complex system of trade, prices and economic laws. But the griffon mind was never constructed to properly take advantage of these systems, as the inferior understanding of our colleagues in Middenheim demonstrates perfectly. Altering the mind is not beyond our ability, however. . ."


###Non-Alligned###
 YAL_central_universities:0 "The Central Universities"
 YAL_central_universities_desc:0 "The universities of Greenback, Greengate and Middenheim all have different specialties, but their leadership shares a similar vision. Ultimately, the goal of science is to serve society. Whether it is with new medicine, new technology or by increasing prosperity, we will work for a better future!"

 YAL_greengate_engineering:0 "Greengate’s Engineering"
 YAL_greengate_engineering_desc:0 "The foremost engineers, both electronic and mechanical, have made Greengate their favoured university. The university is close to Greenback, the industrial beating heart of the country. The engineers of Greengate are eager to receive more funding, promising quick returns in technical advancements!"

 YAL_radar_research:0 "Project Sentinel"
 YAL_radar_research_desc:0 "For some time now, Greengate’s engineers have dreamt of our own RADAR system. Not only will such an array provide us with invaluable scientific data, the listening post would help us keep an eye on our neighbours and spot incoming aircraft. Of course, there is a price tag involved."

 YAL_better_air_detection:0 "Watch Everything"
 YAL_better_air_detection_desc:0 "Project Sentinel is a resounding success and the data is flowing in. However, our scientists hunger for more data to crunch, while our military command is eager to see even more of our rivals’ movements. A little more funding could mean we can improve our Sentinel stations even more!"

 YAL_industrial_engineering:0 "The Machine Spirit"
 YAL_industrial_engineering_desc:0 "A group of very dedicated engineers have begun wearing robes in our university and they also seem weirdly obsessed with prosthetics. They are really knowledgeable, but they maybe care a bit too much about their prized machinery. Their innovations may serve us well, but let’s leave them alone with their machine spirit."

 YAL_synthetic_research:0 "Transmutating the Black Gold"
 YAL_synthetic_research_desc:0 "Greengate University’s heritage goes all the way back to that of griffon alchemists. These proto-scientists diligently worked to use magic and science to make lead into gold. Of course, without modern techniques, their efforts were doomed to fail. But some of our engineers are insisting that we give it another try!"

 YAL_form_computer_faculty:0 "Found the Computing Faculty"
 YAL_form_computer_faculty_desc:0 "Mathematics is the foundation for all science, in fact it is the frame through which we understand the fundamental processes of our world. Visionaries already dreamt of Automatic Computers, but with electronics and mechanics combined, our new Computing Faculty will lead the way into the future!"

 YAL_encryption_decryption:0 "The Wingaarden Theorem"
 YAL_encryption_decryption_desc:0 "Adriaan van Wingaarden, a Feathisian mechanical engineer, is making amazing breakthroughs in the field of computer technology! We should head his ideas closely and make sure that our Computing Faculty stays up to date in this new and boundless field of innovation!"

 YAL_pioneers_in_engineering:0 "Pioneers in Engineering"
 YAL_pioneers_in_engineering_desc:0 "Greengate University has become a campus full of exciting possibilities! The experiments and theories conducted there seem way beyond the possible. The machines built there will revolutionise modern life when they become available for the public. These pioneers are paving the way towards a better tomorrow!"

 YAL_health_sciences:0 "Greenback’s Academy of Medicine"
 YAL_health_sciences_desc:0 "The largest city of the country is also one of many problems. Hard work in the factory, pollution and poverty all harm many griffons. The Greenback Academy of Medicine has done miracles to advance the medical sciences. With substantial support, cures that seem decades away can be achieved within reasonable time!"

 YAL_greenback_hospital:0 "Greenback University Hospital"
 YAL_greenback_hospital_desc:0 "Close to the University of Greenback stands the biggest hospital in Yale, where thousands are being threated simultaneously. It is also the training ground for many doctors in training and a place where through trial and error, science advances slowly. Some refurbishments, extra staff and a new wing are sorely needed to keep our healthcare in order."

 YAL_modernised_medical_procedures:0 "Modernised Medical Procedures"
 YAL_modernised_medical_procedures_desc:0 "The lessons from Greenback will have to be rolled out across the country, if we are to keep our entire population healthy. Every death is a tragedy and with the latest medical technology for all hopsitals we can keep more griffons alive. Our demographic scientists predict that this may lead to a population boom!"

 YAL_pharmacology:0 "Pharmacology"
 YAL_pharmacology_desc:0 "The study of the practical application of new medicine is an up and coming branch of health sciences. Most academics spend too much time in laboratories, crafting up theories and doing controlled tests. Let us focus on how medicine works in the real world, as better medicines will benefit both the people and the army."

 YAL_enhancement_drugs:0 "Combat Stimulants"
 YAL_enhancement_drugs_desc:0 "Our soldiers are subject to all sort of hardships, both physical and mental. The griffon body already has a lot of ways to deal with them, such as adrenaline. However, to give our soldiers a better chance, we can increase their combat effectiveness and perhaps make life at the front slightly easier. Of course, we do not have conclusive data to support that these drugs have any negative side-effects."

 YAL_magical_potential:0 "Magical Potential"
 YAL_magical_potential_desc:0 "The griffon body is different than the one of the unicorn or the changeling, but we are still able to perform acts that could be classified as magical. We must research what makes a griffon magical. How can we alter and increase this? Is magic something immaterial or is there an organ responsible for this? Who knows what we will find after a little research? "

 YAL_unravel_the_mind:0 "Unravel the Mind"
 YAL_unravel_the_mind_desc:0 "The brain sits mightily atop the body, controlling every movement and processing every piece of information it receives, without us consciously thinking it. How curious that we now contemplate the contemplator. How do we think? What did the Gods give us that makes us conscious of our own existence? Is it possible to find out? We must know!"

 YAL_understand_the_body:0 "Understand the Body"
 YAL_understand_the_body_desc:0 "The body houses our soul and our mind, but is the most curious part of this trio. Its complexity and harmony seem to always reveal new depths. It is clear that with each step we take towards understanding our basic physical characteristics, more questions reveal themselves. But knowledge is the reward of the faithful searcher. Knowledge that could save lives. "

 YAL_promise_of_health:0 "The Oath of the Physician"
 YAL_promise_of_health_desc:0 "“I will use treatment to help the sick according to my ability, but never with a view to injury. Into each house I enter, I will enter to help the sick, and I will abstain from all intentional wrong-doing. And what I shall see or hear in the course of my profession, I will hold to be holy secrets. If I carry out this oath, may I gain reputation among all griffons for my art; but if I break it, may the opposite befall me.”"

 YAL_middenheim_business_university:0 "Middenheim School of Economics"
 YAL_middenheim_business_university_desc:0 "With ever more goods being produced and international trade linking the world more closely, the profession of economics has received increased attention. Middenheim, Yale’s leading centre of economists, rejects the alternate models of communists, choosing to improve capitalist theories instead."

 YAL_art_of_negotiation:0 "The Art of Negotiation"
 YAL_art_of_negotiation_desc:0 "“The worst thing you can do in a negotiation is seem desperate to make it. That makes the other bird smell blood, and then you're dead. Leverage is the biggest strength you can have. Leverage is having something the other griffon wants.  Or better yet, simply can't do without. Unfortunately, that isn't always the case, which is why leverage often requires imagination and salesgriffship.”"

 YAL_stock_investiture:0 "National Stock Effort"
 YAL_stock_investiture_desc:0 "For the stock market to be of the greatest benefit to the economy, shareholders should have a long term vision. By increasing the state shares of our most important firms and encouraging investors to keep their stocks for longer terms, our nation will reap the benefits. "

 YAL_clawnes:0 "Lord Meynard Clawnes"
 YAL_clawnes_desc:0 "The economy is a circular flow of money and spending is the crux to prosperity. A lack of confidence in the economy stops consumption, creating depression. To increase the flow of capital, states can keep spending to kickstart the economy. Even war spending will create jobs, just use the money!"

 YAL_government_oversight:0 "Government Oversight"
 YAL_government_oversight_desc:0 "The market is fickle and prone to failure. We must give the government more discretion to intervene, balancing public and private interests. Using equations and models, we can determine where money is needed to get the highest growth. The economy is a car-engine and it demands tuning."

 YAL_state_investments_industry:0 "Boost Aggregate Demand"
 YAL_state_investments_industry_desc:0 "It is indeed demand that determines the strength of the economy. The state can boost demand by embarking on public works projects. The money spent on these works will multiply as it circulates in the economy and gets used by workers to buy other products."

 YAL_steer_the_market:0 "Steer the Market"
 YAL_steer_the_market_desc:0 "The Yalian economy must focus on boosting demand and spending in the economy. Money trapped in the bank accounts of greedy griffons cannot help grow the economy and the more money is trapped, the harder economic growth will become. Let us keep spending and proclaim “We’re all Clawnesians now!”"

 YAL_hawk:0 "August von Hawk"
 YAL_hawk_desc:0 "The economy is not simply put into one equation, but is the culmination of the actions and motivations of all beings. Only real savings and real advancement can grow the economy not an increase of available money. Bailouts, state investments and other such matters distort the market, creating bubbles and keeping losers on top. It is time to get sober and start saving."

 YAL_self_regulated_companies:0 "Self-Regulation"
 YAL_self_regulated_companies_desc:0 "Companies go after their own interest, but only the biggest companies have the power to influence our government directly, distorting the market by rules that benefit them. The only real way to make markets work, is if the state retreats from the arena, so that the market can get the prices right."

 YAL_small_business_encouragement:0 "Small Business Competes"
 YAL_small_business_encouragement_desc:0 "Hawk’s model has been accused of favouring big business, but such is not the case. Some industries have massive barriers to entry, almost naturally creating little competition. In this case, we can intervene by allowing small businesses the chance to compete with the big firms."

 YAL_free_the_market:0 "Free the Market"
 YAL_free_the_market_desc:0 "We must set the market free. No more will stimulus and bailout give perverse incentives. We will balance the books, save money and slowly grow the economy. We will not hold illusions about easy ways to increase production. Hard work, real ingenuity and a trust in the griffons of this country to help each other through the market, will make Yale flourish."

 YAL_economic_prosperity:0 "A Future of Prosperity"
 YAL_economic_prosperity_desc:0 "Whatever path chosen, the economists of Middenheim work tirelessly to update their models and craft the best strategies to face the future. Prosperity has emerged in the country by virtue of a careful economic policy, not one determined by the whims of politicians or mobs. The future is bright for everygriffon!"

 ###Communism###
 YAL_cyrusval_university:0 "Cyrusval University"
 YAL_cyrusval_university_desc:0 "Cyrusval University mainly teaches the social sciences, but unlike Bruma, the campus has become a hotbed for revolutionaries. A spirit of hopeful energy is wrapped around the old university ground as professors preach radical new ideas to young minds from Yale and beyond. It may be dangerous, but perhaps this energy is just what the country needs."

 YAL_the_student_vanguard:0 "Rally the Student Vanguard"
 YAL_the_student_vanguard_desc:0 "It is the duty of those enlightened by the revolutionary spirit, that they spread the truth about the class struggle and capitalist oppression. The students of Cyrusval must lead the way to a better future, so that we may see a classless utopia in our lifetime!"

 YAL_to_the_worker:0 "To the Worker"
 YAL_to_the_worker_desc:0 "It is the curse of capitalism that it placates and indoctrinates the worker to accept its position. We will work in the factories and plough the land, to spread the ideas of socialism and the truth about statist oppression. No longer will the worker direct his anger outwards to other peoples, no, he will direct his anger towards the capitalist structure."

 YAL_to_the_soldier:0 "To the Soldier"
 YAL_to_the_soldier_desc:0 "For centuries, the global elite has enlisted the soldiers from the working class to fight their wars. And while the workers shot each other, the nobility and the bankers profited. The soldiers must be shown a true cause to follow, the red banner of true socialism. We will not fight for any master any longer, but for the revolution!"

 YAL_work_for_freedom:0 "Work for Freedom"
 YAL_work_for_freedom_desc:0 "Many things must be prepared for a revolution. Not only do we need brave griffons to carry the day, we need to have provisions, medical supplies and of course banners ready. In secret, we will work that bit harder to supply our comrades in the upcoming struggle."

 YAL_secure_arms:0 "Secure Arms"
 YAL_secure_arms_desc:0 "We will make good use of our connections in the army to smuggle weapons out of the armouries. When the reactionaries try to overthrow the people’s revolution, they will be surprised to find that we have guns too. "

 YAL_the_faculty:0 "The Faculty"
 YAL_the_faculty_desc:0 "The Faculty of Social Sciences of Cyrusval is well aware of the plight of the working class in most of Griffonia, along with previous attempts at revolution. With increased funding from the central government, the Faculty will be able to develop a social policy that will make Yale strong in these turbulent times. In secret, the Faculty seeks to undermine the government’s legitimacy, preparing the stage for revolution."

 YAL_historical_materialism:0 "Historical Materialism"
 YAL_historical_materialism_desc:0 "History used to be the profession of nationalists, embellishing the myths of their ancient nation to distract the griffons from their own exploitation. The Faculty will unmask this history and show a radically different outlook. The world is ruled by modes of production, which structure a class system. And the age of capitalism is reaching its end..."

 YAL_verelendung_thesis:0 "The Verelendung Thesis"
 YAL_verelendung_thesis_desc:0 "With machines replacing griffons in the production line, production increases, but wages stay the same. Capital accumulates at the top, but workers grow less and less necessary. Once proud artisans are now little more than cogs in the machine. The true contradiction of capitalism is thus: The economy grows larger, but the worker’s condition, as a necessity, becomes more miserable."

 YAL_reject_transition:0 "Reject Transition"
 YAL_reject_transition_desc:0 "The most accepted communist theories, such a practiced in Stalliongrad, favour a post-revolutionary ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’. Sadly, our comrades overseas seem to have forgotten about the temporary nature of this arrangement. To ensure that the revolution is not perverted at the final hour, we will give all means of production and power to the workers."

 YAL_free_association:0 "Free Association"
 YAL_free_association_desc:0 "The state is the premier means of oppression. If there is to be true liberty, even the most liberal of democracies will not do. Only a community of freely associated individuals can guarantee the freedom that is the right of every being. Production will be in the hands of the workers and there will be no structures of power forcing anygriffon to do anything they don’t want."

 YAL_to_the_barricades:0 "To the Barricades!"
 YAL_to_the_barricades_desc:0 "The writings of the Faculty have eroded the legitimacy of the government, while the Student Vanguard has made the people aware of their oppression. Now the time is nigh! Though death may await us, our most precious liberty must be defended with valour! Raise the banner of the Revolution! Flock to the barricades, for the triumph of the communes!"

 YAL_the_communes_of_yale:0 "The Communes of Yale"
 YAL_the_communes_of_yale_desc:0 "We have overthrown the state and the workers can now work on making revolution. Anarchy reigns and the red banners fly over the communes. From the ruins of the old, will arise a world order built on a proletariat labouring for itself, instead of the industrialists. The future is bright, now that we are free!"

 YAL_disband_the_military:0 "Disband the Military"
 YAL_disband_the_military_desc:0 "The soldiers that fought alongside the revolutionaries are brave souls, but their services are no longer required. Every individual is responsible for the safety of their own commune and for the revolution as a whole. We ought to establish voluntary militias with elected officers. Naturally, if anygriff would find their orders objectionable, they may refuse to carry them out. Who could defeat an army of truly free souls?"

 YAL_seize_the_means_of_production:0 "Seize the Means of Production"
 YAL_seize_the_means_of_production_desc:0 "We must wretch away control of the factories from the fat pigs that control them. No more will a griffon be forced into one humiliating job. A free being is able to work on what he wants when he feels like it. The capitalist structure that grinded our souls to dust, will be replaced by a community of free workers, where every labour is an art."

 YAL_reveal_the_illusion_of_money:0 "Reveal the Illusion of Money"
 YAL_reveal_the_illusion_of_money_desc:0 "Money is nothing but the guarantee of a state that they will give a certain amount of gold to the holder of the banknote. It has no inherent or even more importantly, moral, value. Let us burn these useless stacks of paper and laugh while the rest of the world chases happiness by trying to acquire the biggest number of banknotes. We know better now."

 YAL_voluntary_education:0 "Voluntary Education"
 YAL_voluntary_education_desc:0 "Education has been used since the dawn of time to indoctrinate younglings into the current system. It is up to every individual, young and old, what they want to learn and how they want to go about it. The children seem especially overjoyed at the abolishment of homework, while the scientists are looking forward to pursuing their passion projects."

 YAL_cooperative_farms_and_mines:0 "Cooperative Farms and Mines"
 YAL_cooperative_farms_and_mines_desc:0 "Farms and mines are a collective effort and without any organisation, these crucial resources would fall apart. Therefore, specially appointed overseers will plan and guide volunteers in their efforts to make our communes better. The spirits are high and even the darkest mine is full of happy workers!"

 YAL_from_each_according_to_ability:0 "From Each According to Ability"
 YAL_from_each_according_to_ability_desc:0 "Anarchism is no free pass to just sit around all day. In the spirit of free communal association, everygriffon must do their part, however small. If we all contribute, the communes will be the best they can be. With high morale and in true freedom, we will show we can outproduce the statists around us."

 YAL_to_each_according_to_need:0 "To Each According to Need"
 YAL_to_each_according_to_need_desc:0 "The heartless capitalist system did not protect those in need. The so called ‘free market’ is the statists preferred method of distribution, where workers put in the most and the elite gets out the most from the system. Our communes will see every griffon contribute what they can, while taking out what they need. This way, everygriffon will be satisfied in our utopia."

 YAL_classless_society:0 "Classless Society"
 YAL_classless_society_desc:0 "The Communes have succeeded! Against the warnings of statists both communist and capitalist, we have shown the power of true freedom. Together and united in the spirit of free association, we have shown the world that a classless society is within reach, if you but stretch out your claw to grasp it. But we are not done..."

 YAL_anti_statism:0 "Anti Statism"
 YAL_anti_statism_desc:0 "The griffons of Yale may have overthrown their state, but many states still rule most of the world’s sentient beings. We must channel the hate for this global injustice into a wave that will sweep away these nations of oppression. If the Communes of Yale have to lead the charge, so be it."

 YAL_outward_coordination:0 "Outward Coordination"
 YAL_outward_coordination_desc:0 "Although every commune is free to determine their relations with outlying governments and states, it would be wise to coordinate foreign policy and matters of defence. Of course, such an oversight council is merely for coordination and has no formal power of its own. To protect our liberty, all free griffons must work together in harmony against any enemy threat."

 YAL_stalliongrad_exchange:0 "The Stalliongrad Exchange"
 YAL_stalliongrad_exchange_desc:0 "Our misguided comrades overseas have foolishly subjected themselves to a ‘Supreme Soviet’ and other governmental means of oppression. Nevertheless, they are sympathetic to our cause and we have much to learn from each other. We would especially like to learn more about their weapon systems."

 YAL_prywhen_exchange:0 "The Prywhen Exchange"
 YAL_prywhen_exchange_desc:0 "The uneducated peasants of Prywhen had the right idea to revolt against tyranny, but it is slowly becoming clear that they too, will seek to establish a state and reject anarchism. However, their combat experience and agricultural techniques may be of use to us. Surely they will help their fellow revolutionaries."

 YAL_expand_cooperatives:0 "Expand the Cooperative System"
 YAL_expand_cooperatives_desc:0 "Cooperative mines and farms outproduce most of the completely voluntary means of production. By appointing more overseers and regulating the work schedules of more workers, we will be able to vastly increase production with minimal loss of freedom for the individual."

 YAL_carry_the_torch:0 "Carry the Torch"
 YAL_carry_the_torch_desc:0 "The great struggle of our time will see the final destruction of the nation state. For that, the Communes must look north towards Griffenheim, the foremost centre of oppression in Griffonian history. Archons, nobles and generals infest this nest of parasites. Let us overthrow their reaction and carry the torch of freedom to the heart of the Empire."

 #Events
 yale.1.t:0 "Project Delays"
 yale.1.d:0 "Things have been rough at the Great Archives’ construction site. Deliveries of supplies not arriving on time, unusually bad weather and a series of small cases of plain bad luck have together caused a serious delay. No griffon in particular is to blame, but the project will take significantly longer now."
 yale.1.a:0 "Recalculate the timetables. Again."
 
 yale.2.t:0 "Demand for more Funding"
 yale.2.d:0 "“What do you mean, you forgot to put a zero behind that price? You incompetent son of a pony!”\n\nThe head administrator of the Archives project raged uncontrollably at one of his clerks. Of course, the poor griffon could not magically summon a sack of gold coins, so there was little use. The fact remained. The project had gone way over its already ridiculously high budget. He had to ask the government to increase funding, or risk further delays."
 yale.2.a:0 "Increase funding!"
 yale.2.b:0 "Not a penny more."

 yale.8.t:0 "Aura Boreae"
 yale.8.d:0 "The question of the gods’, and more specifically of Boreas’s, true nature had been fascinating the scholars of Yale for a long time. Now, with the most modern techniques and a scientific curiosity some more conservative griffons would call unholy madness, the Yale observatory was ready to pierce into the Heavenly Domain of the Gods.\n\nTheologists, astronomers and physicists collaborated in ‘Project Weihe’, pinpointing the supposed location of Boreas in the night sky, while the most talented engineers prepared the technical instruments which would tear open a path to see into heaven.\n\nAnd on one fateful night, the project was set, and both audio and visual data was coming in from the intricate machinery set up in the university. First nothing, but if the griffons looked close enough, something materialised before their very eyes. Someone, in fact! An intelligent looking, stern, pale, featherless griffon looked back down. His beak seemed distorted in the image, but there was no doubt that this was the face of Boreas. The researchers became ever more excited, they had definitively proven the existence of God! Amidst the excited chatter of self-important scientists congratulating each other, the audio instruments picked up a message: In old Imperial script he proclaimed: "T Genus Emptio."\n\nThis instruction confused the scholars and the theologists present could not place this divine command in any context. When the scholars tried to re-establish contact with Boreas later, the image never appeared again, nor were there anymore messages from the heavens. Perhaps it was better if the wider world did not learn about Boreas’s true message. . . "
