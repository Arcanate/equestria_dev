katerin.1.d:0 "At the end of the year, in the final days of December, Princess Katalina called for a grand ball to be held in Katerinburg. However she was not impressed with the amenities of the Halls that had already existed. In response she had numerous Griffons pulled from across the Principality to tear down the oldest of them and construct a new grand hall. However, with little time to plan and complete the project, the concept had to be based on designs made years ago. While the laborers be worked for every single day with no rest until it was completed, lest the Principality face the wrath of Princess Katalina. By the end of it, numerous workers had vanished, been executed, or simply worked to death, but the Princess had her Ball."
