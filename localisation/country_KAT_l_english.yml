KAT_the_mad_princess:0 "The Mad Princess' Reign"
KAT_the_mad_princess_desc:0 "The title held by Diellza von Katerinburg within her Principality and beyond is "The Insane". Even the most diehard monarchist are forced to concede that the princess in Katerinburg embodies the trappings of hereditary rule. There is no escape from a mad ruler. Her insanity has driven many civil servants and advisors away from her court and makes finding people to work with her government a difficult task. Her antics have ruined whatever remained of Katerin's reputation amongst the Herzlanders. She has attained the dubious achievement of making Katerin known worldwide as a buffoon state. At best."

#KAT_endless_plague:0 "The Einfoort Plague"
#KAT_endless_plague_desc:0 "It seemed almost inevitable that plague would beset the lands of Katerin. Many blame the squalor the people lives in under the uncaring Princess' rule. Some see it as a curse, a divine punishment for her paranoid isolation from the Imperial court. Whatever the cause, it's effects are clear, and most severe. The griffons of Katerin used to comfort themselves by thinking it couldn't get any worse..."
#KAT_plague_fighting:0 "Fighting the Plague"
KAT_the_Deadlands:0 "The Desolation"
KAT_the_Deadlands_desc:0 "Katerin has long been known as a deadweight to the Empire. Even before the reign of Diellza, Katerin was among the poorest regions in the Empire, covered by the dark Scheißwald forest and vast marshland. Things have only gotten worse during Diellza's mad rule. The once booming trade city of Katerinburg was forcibly relocated from the Grifking deeper into the marshes, the nobles abused Diellza's state of mind to gain more privileges at the expense of the peasants and mismanagement became rampant. Sanitation, healthcare and education are all crumbling, like all of Katerin is."

KAT_faint_of_faith_desc:0 "It is a common idea that crisis brings even the most skeptic griffs to religion. Katerin proved it true but eventually became a demonstration of its corollary. As the Crisis in the Principality grows worse, more and more griffons are turning away from worship and prayer, their faith utterly broken by the reality that surrounds them. How can there be a paradise if all you know is Tartarus on earth?"

Since then, she has developed an interesting relationship with this inanimate object. Glitterhoof is Diellza's lover and rival, husband and enemy, depending on the day and Diellza's mood. Sometimes she wants to marry it, sometimes shatter it. This also means Diellza is completely uninterested in any suitors and nobles fear what would happen if their new Prince would be a lifeless pony skull."

### National Focuses ###

KAT_do_own_work:0 "Diellza in Control"
KAT_do_own_work_desc:0 "With matters finally resolved, the time has come to cement Diellzas authority within the principality. The princess herself has little interest in the minute of such a task, and has thus decided delegated large portions of the matter to the Katerintreue. Time will tell if such a decision proves wise."
KAT_assign_yesmen:0 "Expand The Katerintreue"
KAT_assign_yesmen_desc:0 "The Katerintreue as it stands is too small to effectively manage the entire principality, and it must thus be expanded. There is no shortage of ambitious griffons looking for a spot in the Katerintreue, and quite a few favors can be earned in exchange for a favorable assignment within it."
KAT_infiltrate_the_orders:0 "Infiltrate the Orders"
KAT_infiltrate_the_orders_desc:0 "The knightly orders of Katerin have never been very comfortable with the reign of the princess and the Katerintreue. Many within the government fear that they may be plotting to overthrow them. To ensure that such an attempt would be discovered before it can be carried out, several agents of the Katerintreue started to infiltrate the orders, hoping to subvert their power by any means necessary."
KAT_peasant_yesmen:0 "Peasants in the Katerintreue"
KAT_peasant_yesmen_desc:0 "While the Katerintreue may have started out as a noble council, advising the princess on the day to day management of the principality, the growing influence of the organization has made membership a coveted prize within Katerin. Allowing some of the more influential peasants to have a seat on the table will earn us a few valuable favors, and will surely calm the rabble a bit as well."
KAT_pocketed_yeogriffs:0 "Katerintreue Yeogriffs"
KAT_pocketed_yeogriffs_desc:0 "As the infiltration of the knightly orders continues to its next phase, several of our agents have found themselves in lite to be promoted to the position of Yeogriff. If promoted they would be in a much better position to report in on the activities of the guild. Needless to say, supporting these agents should be a priority in the coming weeks."
KAT_armed_taxmen:0 "Armed Tax Collectors"
KAT_armed_taxmen_desc:0 "The griffons of Katerin are, to put it bluntly, destitute. Extracting tax revenues from them is akin to drawing blood from a stone. The solution to this issue is, of course, to smash the stone with a hammer.  From this point onwards, the royal tax collectors of Katerin will carry arms wherever they go, in order to "incentivize" the proper payment of taxes by the populace."
KAT_legalize_banditry:0 "Legalize Banditry"
KAT_legalize_banditry_desc:0 "Katerin barely possesses enough conscripts to keep the main cities and towns safe, and scouring the bandits from the countryside would be an impossible task for our meager forces to accomplish. But recently an... unorthodox solution to the problem of banditry has been presented to the Katerintreue by the Princess, what if banditry were legal?"
KAT_enforcers_of_her_will:0 "Katerintreue Enforcers"
KAT_enforcers_of_her_will_desc:0 "With the bandits now loyal to Katerin, the task of taking full control of the countryside has become possible. But a problem lies with the serfs living in said countryside, they are rather reluctant to serve a government that has done little to help them. Such disobedience cannot be tolerated, and the enforcers of the Katerintreue will make it clear that they have little choice in the matter."
KAT_define_territory:0 "Define Territory"
KAT_define_territory_desc:0 "The newly created enforcers have proven most enthusiastic in carrying out their work, perhaps a bit too enthusiastic. While they do serve the purpose of cowing the serfs excellently, whenever two enforcers meet the result is often far from pretty. The enforcers tend to clash on the ownership of “tax revenues”, and unless the territory of each enforcer is strictly defined, things will continue to get worse."
KAT_enforce_corvee:0 "Remind the Citizens of Their Duty"
KAT_enforce_corvee_desc:0 "As the enforcers of the Katerintreue now patrol the countryside, and the serfs have been reminded of the price of disobedience, the time has come to put them to work. Katerin is in shambles, and reconstructing it is a daunting task. If we are ever to turn the deadlands into profitable parcels of territory, then the serfs must be worked to the bone."
KAT_kat_march_railroad:0 "Katerinburg Railroad"
KAT_kat_march_railroad_desc:0 "Katerinburg, while being the capital of the principality, is a far cry from a modern city. The city itself is plagued with poverty and crime, and a proper railroad connecting it to the rest of the country was never realized, due to the dangers of the surrounding swamp. This state of affairs cannot be tolerated any longer, and the Katerintreue has ordered that rails be laid no matter how many serf lives it takes."
KAT_link_einfoort:0 "Link Lingermill"
KAT_link_einfoort_desc:0 "As the capital now possesses a functioning rail lines, the prospect of linking Lingermill with the capital is now possible. A direct connection between Katerinburg and Andorstadt would cut down on many weeks of travel through treacherous countryside. Some may consider the working conditions needed to establish said rail connection to be dangerous, but such ideas are of no concern to Diellza."
KAT_furstentumwerke_katalina:0 "Fürstentumwerke Diellza"
KAT_furstentumwerke_katalina_desc:0 "Katerin is, to put it bluntly, an industrial backwater. The sheer chaos of the last few years drow away any foreign investment, and any griffon who possessed enough money to fun a factory would much rather spend said money on fleeing from Katerin than investing in it. But with the recent increase in tax revenues, the possibility of the government funding a few factories of its own has been brought up."
KAT_mines_of_andorstadt:0 "Mines of Andorstadt"
KAT_mines_of_andorstadt_desc:0 "Andorstadt is the largest city within Lingermill, and was once the seat of very profitable mines that supported the city's economy. Sadly, the chaos that engulfed the principality, coupled with labor shortages forced the mines to permanently close. But with the Katerintreue now establishing order, a plan using a few prisoners and serfs to reopen them under the authority of the Katerintreue has started."
KAT_trades_education:0 "Trades Education"
KAT_trades_education_desc:0 "The Katerintreue has finally managed to wretch enough control away from the princess to make a proper, if limited, system of education. Rather than the system that Diellza started, that is forcing griffons into a library to read books at random, an education system based around teaching young griffons valuable trades shall be adopted. This is by far the most popular action the Katerintreue has ever taken."
KAT_stahlfabrik_katerinburg:0 "Stahlfabrik Katerinburg"
KAT_stahlfabrik_katerinburg_desc:0 "The mines of Andorstadt now supply the capital with a steady source of iron, and the abundance of the material supplied by the mines has given the industrialists of the Katerintreue an idea. A steel works within the capital would be the most advanced building in the entire principality, and a drain on the treasury. But the long term advantages provided by such a building far outweigh the initial cost of constructing it."
KAT_steam_pump_land_reclaimation:0 "Mechanical Land Reclaimation"
KAT_steam_pump_land_reclaimation_desc:0 "Thanks to the large increases in “tax” revenue the Katerintreue have brought to the principality, the purchase of several trucks, tractors and steam pumps to clear out more swamplands around the capital has begun. These machines will not only serve the purpose of expanding the amount of arable land around the capital, but for a larger push of industrialization across the country too. "
KAT_bribe_those_with_power:0 "Bribe Those in Power"
KAT_bribe_those_with_power_desc:0 "While the Katerintreue holds much sway over the laws of Katerin, it does not yet wield absolute power within the principality. The occasional noble lord still complains about the situation within the principality, with some even daring to write letters to the capital demanding action. With the new tax revenue, we can fix this."
KAT_loyal_gang_bosses:0 "Loyal Gang Bosses"
KAT_loyal_gang_bosses_desc:0 "While normally trusting the leader of a group of bandits is an unwise proposition, this situation in Katerin is far from normal. In particular, several of the gang bosses we have dealt with in the past have proven to be very agreeable to working for the government, especially when certain “incentives” are presented."
KAT_serfs_clear_marshes:0 "Use Serfs to Clear the Marshland"
KAT_serfs_clear_marshes_desc:0 "In order to salvage this disaster of a principality, sacrifices will have to be made. The vast marshlands in Katerin could be put to good use if only the dangerous task of clearing them were accomplished, and compared to the economic advantages such an endeavor would bring, the lives of a few serfs are a pittance."
KAT_increase_peonage_conscripts:0 "Increase Peonage Conscripts"
KAT_increase_peonage_conscripts_desc:0 "The current armed forces under the direct control of the Katerintreue are, to put it bluntly, pathetic. If we are to reclaim control of the countryside then our forces must be drastically expanded, and while former prisoners might not make for the best of soldiers, they do fill out the ranks quite nicely."
KAT_ganger_armies:0 "Punish Disloyalty"
KAT_ganger_armies_desc:0 "Although we have been tolerant of the excesses that our bandit allies are prone to take, the time has come to make it clear that their loyalty and competence is the only thing keeping them alive. Any bandit too ineffective or disloyal will be removed from the principality, permanently."
KAT_rough_diamonds:0 "Rough Diamonds"
KAT_rough_diamonds_desc:0 "The minor nobility of Katerin have spent years fighting and ruling in the countryside, and many of them possess a wealth of experience that utterly dwarfs the average peasant conscript. With enough training and a sense of discipline, perhaps these lordlings could be turned into something more effective."
KAT_investigate_knights:0 "Investigate the Knights"
KAT_investigate_knights_desc:0 "Thanks to the efforts of our agents within the knightly orders, we have gathered enough “evidence” of their “crimes” to start a public inquiry on their transgressions against Katerin and its citizens. As long as the trial goes well, the last opponents of the Katerintreue will be permanently crippled."
KAT_punish_disloyalty:0 "Ganger Armies"
KAT_punish_disloyalty_desc:0 "Even though they do have their peculiarities, it cannot be denied that the gangs now loyal to us are superior to the old peasant militias in nearly every aspect. The ganger units have proven so effective that the idea of phasing out the militias entirely and replacing them with gangs at a permanent basis might not be a bad one."
KAT_warlords_of_katerin:0 "The Warlords of Katerin"
KAT_warlords_of_katerin_desc:0 "As the final militias are replaced by their bandit counterparts, ceirtan quirks within our ranks have made themselves clear. Although they may be battle hardened, rival gangs are more likely to fight each other than the enemy, and their leaders expect more autonomy than the old officers. Katerin has thus been divided between these warlords, with each gang leader effectively a vassal of the Katerintreue."
KAT_clean_the_ranks:0 "Clean the Ranks"
KAT_clean_the_ranks_desc:0 "As the bandits of Katerin are trained into a fully effective military force, it has become clear that their ranks are bloated with the lazy and the incompetent. These griffons have outlived their usefulness, and their former comrades are all too eager to clear out this rot in their ranks."
KAT_clean_house:0 "Clean House"
KAT_clean_house_desc:0 "With the best of the bandits now firmly loyal to the Katerintreue, we finally have the force of arms to remove our remaining enemies from the principality. The few surviving disloyal bandits, the nobles not already within the Katerintreue and any members of the court a bit too loyal to the princess, all will be dealt with in a permanent fashion."
KAT_block_resources_out_east:0 "Embargo the East"
KAT_block_resources_out_east_desc:0 "Retool this into the princess ordering the Katerintreue to fuck with the knights" #needs loc, leads to test the knights where the loyal knights turn on her.
KAT_a_test:0 "Test the Knights"
KAT_a_test_desc:0 "Although the Princess is rapidly outliving her welcome, her eccentricities do have their uses. Perhaps we should listen to her order for the knights to do something so utterly insane that they will be forced to refuse. Which will prove to be the catalyst we are looking for. "
KAT_depose_katalina:0 "Depose Diellza"
KAT_depose_katalina_desc:0 "The time has come. Every single griffon with influence wants Princess Diellza gone, and the mad princess so deluded she thinks that she still controls the principality has far outlived her usefulness. No matter the differences we have, there is no griffon in Katerin will argue against this act."
KAT_a_new_dawn:0 "New Dawn Over Katerin"
KAT_a_new_dawn_desc:0 "With the mad princess finally out of the way and with tentative aid of the popular ex-prelate and the knights, the Katerintreue now rules unchallenged within Katerin. A new dawn rises upon the deadlands, and it is one heralded by the Katerintreue, ready to reap the rewards of their long labour."
KAT_the_spanner:0 "Welcome Industrialists Into The Council"
KAT_the_spanner_desc:0 "A number of the wealthier industrialists in Katerin have expressed their concern that their interests are not being properly represented within the Katerintreue. Naturally, the most successful griffons in the Principality must have their voices heard by the government, especially when certain incentives are offered in return."

#First tree with Diellza ends here

KAT_deal_with_corpses:0 "Dealing with the Corpses"
KAT_deal_with_corpses_desc:0 "With the garrison now in full control of the city of Einfoort. They must deal with the plague ridden corpses left behind by this particularly nasty wave of prestilence. How they handle the task is still up in the air..."
KAT_close_the_gates:0 "Close the Gates"
KAT_close_the_gates_desc:0 "This city is plagued, that much is clear. Now we have to keep it contained. The city of Einfoort shall be on lockdown until further notice. May Boreas have mercy on all those left inside."
KAT_burn_everything:0 "Burn Everything"
KAT_burn_everything_desc:0 "The city is truly in rough shape. Even now there are still hundreds if not thousands of plague ridden Griffons, clothing, food, even water stores. Nothing can be spared, if we are to overcome this it must all burn."
KAT_they_have_airpods:0 "Alert the Peasantry"
KAT_they_have_airpods_desc:0 "Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of the garrison, preventing mourning family members and curious onlookers from investigating Einfoort has proven to be an impossible task. Although keeping the exact details of the events that occurred within that forsaken city would be ideal, the common folk must be warned of the danger that the ruins pose, lest another outbreak start."
KAT_oh_god_oh_fuck:0 "An Update"
KAT_oh_god_oh_fuck_desc:0 "A letter from Katerinburg has recently arrived at the Garrisons temporary headquarters outside the city. And, as it turns out, the Katerintreue is less than pleased with the Garrisons creative interpretation of their orders, as well as their version of what constitutes the truth."
KAT_salvage_the_situation:0 "Salvaging the Situation"
KAT_salvage_the_situation_desc:0 "As the letter from Katerinburg made quite clear, the current policy of keeping the peasantry away from the remains of the city is less than ideal. The common folk must be let back into the city, to prevent the spread of the plague at the very least, and the Garrison must at least put in a token effort of patrolling the streets."
KAT_under_the_rug:0 "Make A Cover Story"
KAT_under_the_rug_desc:0 "The truth behind the events that occurred within Einfoort must never make it outside of the city, and preferably it must be stamped out within the city itself. A few convenient scapegoats will hopefully draw the attention away from the Garrison. And Boreas knows what would happen if the knights were ever to discover the truth."
KAT_oh_no_we_are_too_late:0 "Out of Claw"
KAT_oh_no_we_are_too_late_desc:0 "The previous estimates of the number of griffons carrying the plague within Einfoort had always been suspiciously low, but after a serious investigation, the true scale of this issue has dawned on us. The infection is spreading at an exponential rate, even after the measures that were taken by the garrison. It is clear that more decisive actions must be taken. "
KAT_this_whole_city:0 "Condemn the Lost"
KAT_this_whole_city_desc:0 "Even after the city was burnt, the sick of Einfoort were still allowed to live and flee to the countryside. This was clearly a mistake, those who are sick with the plague are truly beyond saving, granting them a quick death at this point is only mercy."
KAT_must_be_purged:0 "The Cull Across Katerin"
KAT_must_be_purged_desc:0 "Although Einfoort is cleansed of the filth that once infested it, the issue of the infected across the entire principality has yet to be addressed. They must be cleansed. Every griffon showing only the slightest symptoms of the plague will be culled, at this point, it is the only way to save Katerin from destruction by this infernal disease. "

KAT_the_search_begins:0 "The Search Begins"
KAT_the_search_begins_desc:0 "If the root cause of this plague is ever to be found, a thorough search of the entirety of Einfoort must be conducted. Every house must be examined, every possible way for the plague to enter the city must be investigated. The Knights of the Silberkralle will get to the bottom of this conundrum, no matter what it takes."
KAT_tend_to_the_sick:0 "Tend to the Ill"
KAT_tend_to_the_sick_desc:0 "Although the investigation of the plague must remain the primary focus of the Silberkralle, that does not mean ignoring the plight of the sick griffons within the city. Their transition from this world to the next will be made as comfortable as possible, it is the least we could do."
KAT_isolate_plague:0 "Isolate the Plague"
KAT_isolate_plague_desc:0 "Through a careful investigation of the city by our valiant knights, the areas where the plague is most concentrated have been identified, and the next phase of the investigation can start. The sick will also be isolated to those areas, to prevent them from spreading the plague further."
KAT_the_source:0 "Find the Source"
KAT_the_source_desc:0 "We are getting closer and closer to the source of all this madness, and along with it comes a troubling realization. While the possibility seemed extremely remote at first, the prospect that this plague was unleashed upon Einfoort deliberately, rather than spreading through natural means. "
KAT_clean_alms:0 "Sanitation Improvements"
KAT_clean_alms_desc:0 "Einfoort is far from the most modern city, and it's deteriorated state did little to improve its sanitation system. The city must be cleaned, waste must be properly disposed of and infected wells must be identified and closed."
KAT_outside_grain:0 "Import Clean Grain"
KAT_outside_grain_desc:0 "There is something wrong with the grain in Einfoort, and it is looking more and more likely that it was one of the vectors through which the infection pierced the city. Importing clean grain from the other provinces of Katerin, although expensive, might do much to slow the infection."
KAT_a_calm_over_einfoort:0 "A Calm over Einfoort"
KAT_a_calm_over_einfoort_desc:0 "Through the tireless efforts of the Silberkralle, the chaos and desperation that once enveloped Einfoort has all but disappeared. The sick are being dealt with in a humane way, and the city has started on the long road to recovery."
KAT_research_plague:0 "Study the Plague"

But there is nothing pious or holy about the Archons, who sit in their ivory towers unaware of the hardships the common folk endure. True piety is found within the common priests, who humbly tend to their flock, without making claims of rulership over the temples."

katerin.1.t:0 "Princess Diellza's New Year Ball."
katerin.1.d:0 "At the end of the year, in the final days of December, Princess Diellza Von Diellza called for a grand ball to be held in Katerinburg. However she was not impressed with the amenities of the Halls that had already existed. In response she had numerous Griffons pulled from across the Principality to tear down the oldest of them and construct a new grand hall. However, with little time to plan and complete the project, the concept had to be based on designs made years ago. While the laborers be worked for every single day with no rest until it was completed, lest the Principality face the wrath of Princess Von Diellza. By the end of it, numerous workers had vanished, been executed, or simply worked to death, but the Princess had her Ball."
katerin.1.a:0 "Don't lose your head on the dancefloor!"

katerin.2.t:0 "Plague in Einfoort!" 
katerin.2.d:0 "The decaying settlement of Einfoort lies south of the capital. The city itself seems to be representative of Katerin as a whole, its glory days are long behind it, with years of neglectful rule and exploitation having taken a heavy toll from the once burgeoning settlement. The once proud walls of the keep have been in a state of perpetual disrepair for the last 20 years, doing little to discourage any potential attacker. The city itself has grown far beyond the boundary of the walls, with villagers fleeing from bandits and the plague taking refuge in an ever-expanding network of tents and shanties.  The city is in ruins, all that remains is its decaying cadaver, and the vultures have come to feast.\n\nWith the constant stream of refugees to the city, it was inevitable, the plague has come to Einfoort. If the city, and more importantly its inhabitants are to be saved, then decisive action must be taken.\n\nWhen news of the plague arrived at the capital, the knightly orders of katerin stood ready to secure the city at a moments notice. The orders have served the principality with an upright zeal for centuries, dedicated to upholding a tradition of chivalry that stretches back hundreds of years. Two major orders have established themselves within the Principality, and both have volunteered for the task.\n\nFirstly, there is the venerable order of the Silberkralle, lead by the honorable Grandmaster Hector Ardennson.  The Silberkralle acts as the sword and the shield of the common griffon, striving to make the life of the peasants as comfortable as possible given the circumstances. The Silberkralle desires to calmy and carefully take control of the city, minimizing the danger to the common folk and granting those to sick to survive a merciful and peaceful end.\n\nThe other knightly order of Katerin, the Argentumdämmerung has also volunteered for the task. Lead by the fervent Grandmaster Erik Grimclaw, the foremost objective of the Argentumdämmerung is to pull the plague out by its roots, and reclaiming the deadlands of Katerin for the Empire. What they lack in experience they make up for in zeal, and they seek to drag the plague from the city as quickly as is possible, minimizing the risk of infection for the populace.\n\nOf course, the Orders could always be dismissed and Einfoorts garrison given the task of restoring order, but the garrison was already small and poorly maintained before the plague hit, and there is no telling what methods they might resort to."
katerin.2.a:0 "The Garrison locks down the city."
katerin.2.b:0 "The Silberkralle intervenes."
katerin.2.c:0 "Argentumdämmerung scourges the city."

katerin.3.t:0 "Einfoort in Chaos." 
katerin.3.d:0 "When the Garrison was given the ultimate responsibility of restoring order within Einfoort, many of its denizens were relieved. Fearing that the zealotry of the Orders would only serve to increase the damage and that entrusting such a task to the garrison of the city would result in the least amount of damage to the city. But none could predict what methods the garrison would resort to, the means by which they would purify the city of the diseased. \n\nThe problems started only a few days after the garrison was given the task, when food shortages combined with a fear of the plague caused a panic amongst the peasants. The garrison found itself overwhelmed, and was ultimately forced to retreat within the crumbling walls of the keep while the riot burnt itself out. This incident was clearly the last straw for the garrison, who perceived their position as untenable. Fearing for their lives and becoming ever more paranoid of the plague, the garrison took the only option that made sense to them.\n\nThey burnt the city to the ground. Gathering the remaining oil and torches contained within the keep, the garrison procededed to methodically walk through the city, setting everything they encountered ablaze, and killing all those who resisted. \n\nThe plague is gone, and Einfoort along with it. All that remains of the city are burnt ruins, and whatever poor wretches who managed to escape the blaze.  "

katerin.4.d:0 "When the orderly columns of the Silberkralle marched into Einfoort, many of its citizens saw them as divine saviors sent by Boreas himself. The Silberkralle is well known for its compassion and sympathty for the lower classes of Katerin, and their arrival gave the desperate populace of the city the glimmer of hope that they had desperately been seeking. The Talon was quick to officially relieve the beleaguered garrison of the city, who were immensely pleased that the city was now someone else's problem.\n\nA curfew was shortly enforced across the city, with the Knights of the Talon restoring order to the streets with efficiency, yet not without compassion. The Knights of the Talon have been understanding but firm, who sook to separate the diseased from the healthy and allow them to live out their final days in peace. The citizens of Einfoort were undoubtedly put at ease due to these efforts, there was a deeper meaning to them.\n\nThe Silberkralle carries with it a secret objective, they seek to establish the exact cause behind the infection, and the mysterious plague that Katerin has suffered for so long. The Knights have questioned every single sick griffon they have found with vigor, trying to find the root of the infection, and the route through which it first managed to arrive within the city.  Time will tell what secrets they uncover. "

katerin.5.d:0 "The Knights of the Argentumdämmerung entered Einfoort in a somber but disciplined manner. They paid no attention to the unwitting bystanders who thought help had arrived. They knew that their task would be a bloody one, that in order to save the city, the rot that lies at its core must be pulled out, and that there would be no avoiding collateral damage. But they were resigned to their bloody task for if they did not carry it out, then who would? The knights would do whatever needed to be done but they would take no pleasure from it.\n\nThe Grandmaster of the Argentumdämmerung himself, Eric Grimclaw, was leading them. He was not one to shy away from such a challenge, and he would not dream of making his loyal knights carry alone the burden of such a task. The Grimclaws could trace their ancestry all the way back to the founding of Katerin itself, and although they had lost control of the principality, the last scion of the Grimclaws still wielded great influence within his homeland.\n\nThe knights quickly took the reigns off the garrison and moved to secure every quarter of the city. Every single house was to be searched for any trace of the infection, and those of the sick deemed to be beyond saving were granted a merciful end at the hands of the knights. Einfoort would be cleansed, nevermind the cost."

katerin.6.d:0 "As the news of Einfoort's ultimate fate spreads around Katerin, panic enveloped the populace. The government had never held the best interests of the lower classes in mind, but the griffons had never imagined that it would perpetrate such a blatant atrocity against its own citizens. The common griffon had already known that the military would do little to protect them against bandits, but now every single garrison was seen as a collection of murderers and madmen. Protests over the bonfire of Einfoort erupted in the major cities of Katerin, and those protests soon erupted into riots, ones that had to be dispersed by force.\n\nThe citizens of Katerin now flook to anyone who promises to save them from the claws of their government, with both of the Knightly Orders have received a large boost in applications to join. But not every griffon can count on the protection of the knights, limited in griffonpower as they are. For these poor wretches, there is nothing to protect them if the nearest garrison were to turn on them. They yearn for something to protect them from the abuses thrust upon them by their government, and grow more radical by the day."

But as the days passed by, the leadership of the Talon becomes all the more intrigued by the situation in Einfoort. When the Talon first arrived, a special detachment of knights was issued the task of identifying the exact means by which the plague entered the city, hoping to prevent such a fate befalling the other major settlements of Katerin. These knights diligently questioned each and every infected Griffon they encountered, trying to establish a timeline that stretched back to the first infected griffon to enter the settlement. \n\nYet their task, although by no means a simple one, has only grown stranger as they look deeper into the roots of problem. Their informants disappear, griffons who were healthy just a few days before suddenly contract the plague, and it seems that most of the records the garrison kept about the state of the city from the time the infection was first reported seems to have mysteriously disappeared. \n\nAs they dug deeper into the case, their suspicion have only grown. A request for more investigators was soon sent to the headquarters of the Silberkralle, and now a steady stream of scribes and knights flock to Einfoort in an effort to investigate this mystery. There is something rotten in the foundations of Einfoort, perhaps in the whole of Katerin, and the Silberkralle will stop at nothing to find out what it was."

That the would be able to root out the infection quickly and cleanly, saving the majority of the population from the ravages of the plague. They were wrong. Despite their best efforts, there seems to be no end to the infected. The Knights try to separate the infected and the healthy entirely, but keeping loved ones from the sick is an almost impossible task, and one that some of the knights do not resilient enough to handle. \n\nWhat was supposed to be a quick and merciful execution turns into a drawn-out battle of attrition against the plague, the sick are disposed of in the most efficient manner possible, but such a task takes a toll on both the body and the mind. Many knights are unable to handle the pressure, and end up leaving the settlement traumatized by their own actions. Others fall victim to the plague, and have to be dispatched by their own comrades. Yet in the face of such immense psychological pressure, Eric Grimclaw remains unflinching in carrying out his duty.\n\nMore knights are called to the settlement, to relive the ones that are unable to continue on with the task. Eric would see to it that the plague would not spread any further than Einfoort, he had taken a personal vow to cleanse the city, and he would not have anything stop him. He wouldn't allow the sacrifice of the ones who had already died within the walls of the city to be in vain. He couldn't live with himself if he did."

katerin.9.d:0 "News rarely reach Katerin quickly, but this time it only took a week. A messenger made his way down the Grifking river and then through the marshy roads to reach Katerinburg and deliver the news in person to the Princess. He had been sent by Wingfried von Katerinburg, the Princess' cousin who was a member of the Knights of Hellquill and the infamous Reformisten. Pompously and proudly he told that her cousin was now the Grandmaster of Hellquill. However, Diellza seemed to care little, merely smiling a bit. But then it's as if she remembered something and said: "Oh, I almost forgot! I need to invite Wingfried to my wedding as well! Now he has a high enough rank to be a prestigious guest worthy of my husband."\n\nNo one really knew what wedding she was talking about, before she revealed her plans to marry Glitterhoof, a unicorn skull which Wingfried had gifted her years ago. She ordered the messenger to deliver an invitation to the wedding to Wingfried and that it would be held in a week."

katerin.10.d:0 "Soon after assuming power, Grandmaster Wingfried sent a messenger to Katerin, to inform his cousin Diellza von Katerinburg that he was now a mighty Grandmaster. However, when the envoy returned, he delivered a message that wasn't a congratulations like Wingfried had expected, but an invitation.\n\nPrincess Diellza was inviting him to her wedding with Glitterhoof, who would become the Prince of Katerin. At first, Wingfried didn't recognize the name, before remembering it was a unicorn skull Wingfried had gifted to Diellza several years ago. He knew that his cousin had grown oddly fond of the trophy, but now she wanted to marry it? Truly, she had gone completely insane like he had feared.\n\nThe messenger asked if he would accept the invitation. While Wingfried felt sympathy for his cousin, he also found it despicable that she would love the remains of a filthy pony so much. He hoped her cousin wouldn't be too upset if he said no..."

Reluctantly he requested an audience with the Princess in private. Diellza met him and, bouncing from excitement, asked if cousin Wingfried was coming to her wedding. After gulping, the messenger quietly said "No."\n\nDiellza's smile snapped and turned into a frown. She shook her head in disbelief and began to breathe heavily. Then she called for her guards to seize the messenger and execute him immediately, which they did. A dozen servants were executed as well as Diellza blamed them for Wingfried's refusal. She retreated to her personal quarters and trashed several thousand idols worth of luxury furniture. After crying and ranting for a day, she announced that her wedding with her loved one, Glitterhoof, was cancelled."

katerin.16.t:0 "The Alchemist returns to the Princess"
katerin.16.d:0 "Princess Diellza held court every single day to hear the pleas of her subjects, on paper that is. In reality the Princess' court, in the rare few days she decides to show up to it, is a strange and unnerving proceeding. Most of the nobles avoid making anything more than a token appearance at them, as any slight interaction with the Princess has the potential for a lethal result. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to her actions, and asking her to judge on anything was to invite disaster. To take a recent example, a griffon who had lost all of his belongings to bandits was sentenced to prison for not having protected his own property.\n\nOnly the truly desperate approached the mad princess when she presided over court, which made it all the stranger when a griffon fitting none of those descriptors approached her openly. The potion salesman hailed from Yale, and had operated within Katerin for a time many decades ago as the court alchemist for the Princess' father. The aged griffon carried with him a suitcase, and contained within were three vials which he hoped would, at the very least, soothe the princess for a while.\n\nThe alchemist proceeded to present the vials to the princess, and he made it clear to her that only one could be chosen, as mixing potions rarely had good results. Firstly, there was the vial that came from the north. It had the most brilliant aquamarine color the court had ever seen, and even still as the liquid was within the vial, strange patterns seemed to appear within the fluid if one looked at it long enough. \n\nThe next vial came from the south, concocted within the alchemist's laboratory within Angriver. The dark green liquid within seemed to move on its own, swirling around within the vial even when no outside force was acting upon it. The vial itself was hot to the touch, and it was clear that the liquid within was far from dormant, although the alchemist assured that it was safe to drink.\n\nLastly, there was the vial that hailed from the west. Unlike the others, the liquid within this vial seemed completely inert. It was completely clear, colorless and lacked any odor to speak of as well. No matter how long the vial was studied by the nobles, it seemed no different than normal drinking water. Perhaps that is what made it the most frightening of all the liquids to some. After all the liquids had been presented, the time had come for the Princess to choose which one she would drink."

katerin.18.d:0 "Princess Diellza had been working hard the last few days, managing the principality was no easy task after all, and she had decided to take a day off from her duties to enjoy with her paramour Gliterhoof. The dining hall in the palace had been reserved for this occasion, and she had made sure to select only the very best delicacies for Gliterhoof. And with the preparations for the dinner complete, the time had come for her date with Gliterhoof to begin.\n\nThe hall itself was decorated in the most lavish manner possible, with colored banners adorning the walls, and portraits of Diellza's honored ancestors watching over the dining table. The appetizers of tonight's meal already adorned the table, as the palace's cooks had, on Diellza's orders, spared no expense in preparing for tonight's feast. The princess entered the dining hall, clothed in one of her more ostentatious dresses, and took her seat at the end of the table.\n\nAs she took her seat, she spotted Glitterhoof on the opposite end of the table. The skull was freshly polished for the occasion, and even had a rather expensive looking hat on. The princess started eating her meal and quickly decided to strike up a conversation with her date. "So how are you enjoying the feast Gliterhoof, I trust that everything is to your satisfaction?"\n\nThe Skull wasn't very talkative.\n\nThe lack of a reply from Gliterhoof did little to deter the Princess, who cheerfully continued to speak. "Oh my, I can see that you haven't even touched your portion of the meal, Don't worry dear, I'll make sure that the cooks are suitably punished for serving food that is so antithetical to your tastes."\n\nThe rest of the date went in much the same way, with the Princess having a seemingly infinite capacity to talk to the skull. The palace guard could do little but watch, and quietly inform the cooks that they best make themselves disappear before the meal is over."

A lifetime of training and struggle had honed his skills in strategy to a fine edge, and the griffon himself was no stranger to the battlefield, having received the majority of his experience during the fierce fighting against the Republicans during their mass uprising. \n\nBut his disposition had soured with age, and having to suffer through one incompetent noble council after another did little to improve it. Over time, his youthful enthusiasm was replaced by a stone mask of composed detachment. \n\nIt was the very same mask that mask would be shattered on a routine patrol to Eifoort. His party was surveying the outskirts when they noticed it, a few disturbed sections of farmland being the only obvious signs that anything was amiss. Hector went by himself to investigate the site, and when he returned it was clear that something had shocked him.\n\nThe field had contained the corpse of a unicorn, one that had been alive only a few hours earlier. The Grandmaster could hardly believe what he saw, and stood silently at the site for hours after sending his party to secure the surrounding area, and to fetch the Grandmaster of the other knightly order still remaining in the principality.\n\nGrandmaster Eric soon arrived, and his initial reaction was one of astonishments. "Gods, I've seen the dead before, but never a pony. Do we have any leads, are there any traces of what might have done this?"\n\nHector already knew that field was empty save for the corpse and the two griffons observing it, and the wind howling through the grass around them. "Beyond the fact that it was a unicorn, we have little to no evidence to go on. Its as if the poor thing was clothed like a mage, so our investigation will most likely start from there." Hector wanted nothing more than to give the pony a proper burial, but he knew that would have to wait until a thorough analysis of the wounds was completed.\n\nHector gazed at the body one last time, before heading off to rejoin his party to start the investigation properly. He left Eric at the scene to guard it until a proper perimeter could be established, and as Eric watched Hector disappear into the distance, he could hear him muttering to himself. "

The members of the Inner Circle present met in their tent outside the city to discuss the situation. Among them stood the young Grandmaster Eric Grimclaw. Barely older than a fledgling, he stood out amongst his elders. But he embodied the idea that in souls nobly born, valour does not depend upon age. Next to him sat Eggert Von Strathburg and Gunter Drakkenwald, the two highest ranking knights of the Inner Circle. Von Strathburg had conducted the first actions in the city and his face was still veiled by grief over the death of several of his subordinates. Gunter had arrived only the day before at the head of the relief force but still managed to make himself unwelcome by criticizing the infirmaries set up by Von Strathburg’s griffs.\n\nThe knights opened their meeting by a prayer. After, Grimclaw gave the floor to Eggert. He proceeded to paint a bleak portrait of the situation. He reminded the Circle of some of the atrocities his knights witnessed in the city from some of their inhabitants. In his eyes, Einfoort was virtually lost and needed to be treated not as a city to relief but as a target to tackle with brute force. To save Einfoort would require to save it not only from the plague but from itself. Several knights banged the table in approval and Grimclaw himself seemed to agree with Von Strathburg but Gunter asked to speak. The Grandmaster allowed him.\n\n“Brothers and sisters, Grandmaster. There is no question about the valour of our knights and their sacrifices in Einfoort. Yet, I fear that we have wrongly took our Grandmaster’s call for crusade too literally. One does not tackle a plague city like a rebellious uprising. We need to care for these griffons and act with a cool head.”\n\nEggert scoffed at the remark: “How dare you, brother? If you had indeed showed up in time, we might not be in the situation we are in.” Gunter glared back at the griff. “Tread carefully, Eggert. If you think boasts of brashness will grant you authority, let me remind you we are not tavern drunks listening to stories.” Eggert put his claws on the table and rose up. “I will not take insults lightly from a coward!”\n\nGrimclaw rose his claw and demanded silence: “Enough.” Gunter and Eggert obeyed and sat down. “My father had absolute trust in your valour and competence. This much I know. So remember your oaths. Both sides have merit and we must stand together because..."
#katerin.63.a:0 "This city is worth fighting to protect."
#katerin.63.b:0 "Einfoort is rotten to the core."

#katerin.64.t:0 "The Streets of Einfoort."
#katerin.64.d:0 "Under the leadership of Gunter Drakkenwald, the knights organized a vast plan to take back control of the streets. They enlisted the help of locals and peasants. Equipped with whatever tools available and gauze masks or protected by cloth dipped in vinegar, they began to clear the streets of whatever blocked them. Corpses were taken away to be burnt. Trash and boulders from various ruins were cleared. The infected people were brought to the dispensaries and homeless relocated to relief camps around the city to restore some semblance of order. Then pumps brought by the knights or salvaged from the local firefighters’ barracks were set up and slowly but surely, the streets began to be cleaned by the civilians under the protection of the knights. Fountains, wells and other water sources were either rigorously scrubbed or condemned. The task had not been an easy one and many of the workers fell ill themselves, despite the protections.\n\nWith the way now cleared, the knights set about establishing various outposts throughout the cities. The city’s squalor was far from purged but at least, they could know venture into the streets in a more or less normal way."
#katerin.64.a:0 "This city needs us."

#katerin.65.t:0 "The Sorry State of the City."
#katerin.65.d:0 "Under the guidance of Eggert Von Strathburg and grandmaster Erik Grimclaw, the knights entered Einfoort once more. This time, in force and with a clear objective : cutting a way into the city. This was no easy task. The roads of Einfoort had become a mess of rubbles, abandoned carts, garbage and even corpses left to rot.\n\nFollowing a map drawn up by Gunter Drakkenwald, they got to work to clear the streets along specific lines. The peasants would gather all obstacles and burn them. In some places, buildings would be tore down to allow for easier and safer passage. As for the homeless, they were rounded up and lead to quarantined areas outside the city. The plan was to create a network to allow the Argentumdämmerung to move quickly in the city, control the movements of the population and institute a curfew. These new roads into Einfoort were quickly nicknamed the Sacred Way.\n\nAfter the knights were finally able to move unhindered once more, they spread the word to the population: the city was now under curfew. All those found in the streets during curfew would be considered rebels and shot at."
#katerin.65.a:0 "We are doing them a favor."

#katerin.66.t:0 "Trimming off the Diseased parts."
#katerin.66.d:0 "During the early days of the intervention, the knights had gathered information about the city. Those sent into the city marked street entrances and doorways in Argentumdämmerung code indicating information about infection spread, hostility and inhabitants. Code was used to prevent any efficient tampering by locals. Reports were aggregated by the Order’s scholars who drew tactical maps of the city.\n\nOn the basis of these informations, the knights divided the city into areas : safe, curfewed, quarantined or forbidden areas. The last ones were deemed to be so infested by the plague and in such a state of squalor and disrepair that they were to be burned down. A few selected parts of the quarantined areas would also be destroyed.\n\nThe controlled destruction was organized by joint teams of knights, firefighters and engineers from all over Katerin and priests, all supervised by Eggert Von Strathburg. Teams of knights and priests were sent to order the population to evacuate, giving them some hours to leave with their most important belongings. The evacuation went more or less smoothly, with priests helping to ease the resistance of the evacuees and the knights leading orderly columns of exhausted people out of the city. As it happened, engineers, firefighters and knightly sappers set about isolating the parts for the city that were to be destroyed and placing strategic charges or gasoline. Due to the lack of proper equipment, bales of hay were used to propagate the fire.\n\nAt ten o’clock the next day, the fires were lit. Argentumdämmerung teams were strategically placed to prevent any spread of the fire beyond the desired areas and to contain any panic among the population. The blaze did its work remarkably quickly and after it was done, like a sign of the gods, a small breeze helped to clear the smoke away."
#katerin.66.a:0 "There is nothing we can do for them but give them peace."

#katerin.67.t:0 "Culling the Plague."
#katerin.67.d:0 "Over weeks, knight Eggert Von Strathburg and grandmaster Erik Grimclaw had grown closer. They were both at Einfoort during the early days of the crusade and they had seen the disaster that it was before Gunter and the critics got there, after they had begun their work. They knew that to call what they had over Einfoort control was overly optimistic and that it could easily be reverted. Some parts of the city were lost to the plague and unrest or were simply about to collapse or burn down, possibly taking entire blocks with them. They needed to take radical actions.\n\nThe knights had begun to mark down the situation of the city in the streets by painting symbols in Argentumdämmerung code over the doors and at the entrance of the streets. They also had at their disposals some maps that the scholars under Gunter had drawn up. Eggert then devised a plan and presented it to Erik who heartily agreed. He too felt that difficult measures had to be taken.\n\nOver the next few days, knights were ordered to begin to evacuate buildings and areas that were deemed too dangerous to be left alone. To prevent any delay, the knights were order to break in and order the immediate departure of the inhabitants. Those that did not would be forced out and put under quarantine. Then, the buildings and areas would be burned down."
#katerin.67.a:0 "This entire city must be purged..."

#katerin.68.t:0 "Breaking and Entering."
#katerin.68.d:0 "Weeks of reports gathering by the knights under Gunter Drakkenwald and Eggert Von Strathburg had begun to paint an unexpected picture of the city. The plague was behaving strangely. Reports of unrest from Eggert’s knights and maps of the epidemy from Gunter’s scholars were showing surprising patterns. The most infected parts of the city were coinciding with the more unruly parts of the city, which, according to the locals weren’t even the old bad neighbourhoods. Worse, some witnesses. While Eggert and Gunter were arguing about the value of their respective informations, Grandmaster Grimclaw pounced on it with the confidence of youth. He ordered an immediate investigation into these places.\n\nAfter sunset, the knights quietly took to the streets in small units. Armed with sledgehammers, they broke into all suspect buildings. Many of the knights found only corpses, terrorized inhabitants or simply dust. But in a few cases, what they found was unlike anything they had ever seen. They found perfectly maintained workshops in otherwise rundown neighbourhoods. They had found nogriff there but some poor souls in cages, dead or in the state of apathy that characterised the late stages of the plague. Instead of tools, the buildings were full of strange substances, notably a strangle white-ish powder. One knight who grew up in a butcher’s family noticed how oddly close it was to bone meal. Documents were seized, written in a foreign language that nogriff seemed to recognize at first glance. And most ominously, they found crates of relief food, with markings from the temples of Eyr, the princely authorities or, even more worryingly, the knightly orders themselves.\n\nThe findings were put under the surveillance of selected knights unanimously trusted by the Inner Circle and all involved in the search were sworn to secrecy. In addition, a rigorous inspection of all food reserves were ordered."

katerin.70.t:0 "An Unsettling Find."
katerin.70.d:0 "It was late when knight Hermina was finally found. She had not reported for duty after her patrol assignment and some thought she had deserted. She hadn’t but she was in bad shape. Knights who had found her, well outside the city saw here wandering aimlessly, mumbling to herself, beak slamming and her head wounded. She opposed no resistance and was brought back to the infirmary. After receiving care, she began to emerge and explained what had happened to her. After noticing a petty act of looting from a fledgling, she pursued him. The chase brought her to a condemned warehouse. There, she walked on a rotten plank and fell through the floor. She tried to fly but her wing got stuck in debris and she continued her fall. She described how she came back to her senses, only to notice strange shapes in the dark. After lighting her torch, she saw them. Dead bodies. Cages and cages of them. She then blacked out, something the doctor blamed on the shock and head wound.\n\nA team lead by Grandmaster Grimclaw and knight of the Inner Circle Gunter set out to find the warehouse. Thanks to Hermina’s account, they found it and what they discovered was far worse than what they envisioned. There were indeed cages. But not a few. Dozens of them. All containing unicorns that had died, abandoned to the plague and without food and water. There were traces of resistance and of escape attempts but the unicorns must had been too weak to succeed. The knights didn’t know what to make of their findings at first. Einfoort had no notable pony minority, let alone unicorns. But after inspection of the location, they found some abandoned pieces of papers that looked like delivery slips for cattle. Perhaps how they had been smuggled. Another knight, one who had served in Longsword, noticed how some of the unicorn clothing looked like those from that region. Sadly, they found no traces of any living creatures in the compound.\n\nWhatever was happening in Einfoort, it was not limited to it. And it certainly wasn’t natural."

katerin.71.t:0 "True Scum."
katerin.71.d:0 "Erik slowly walked into the warehouse. He was greeted by Eggert. The griff who had always been so angry seemed calm. Erik looked at him a bit longer than usual, looking into his eyes. He was indeed not angry. There was a fatigue in his eyes, one he saw in his father’s eyes years ago, before he died. Erik didn’t understand at the time. He longed sometimes for those simple days of ignorance, when the only Katerin he knew was a beautiful country were soldiers and knights were simply sometimes very agitated. Now, he was one of them.\n\n“My lord grandmaster”, Eggert said. “We knew people in Einfoort were going to use the troubles for criminal purposes. Such is the way of sinners in times of hardships. But this is worse.” Erik simply answered “Show me.”\n\nThey both took the ladders and descended down the hole at the center of the warehouse. They arrived in a large room lit by flickering torches. It was a warehouse alright. One for those monsters who deal in life. There were cages upon cages, all filled with corpses. Unicorns. Not a single griffon in sight. Only unicorns. Many bore the marks of terrible treatments and chains. Some had been disfigured but all of them had died by lack of care, water and food. The cowards behind all of this didn’t even have the gut to care for their merchandise after the knights had arrived! Erik gritted his beak. Fatigue didn’t evercome him. Only a boiling rage. He wanted those who did this. He turned to Eggert.\n\n“Burn this all down. And put knights around the building. Arrest any griff who even looks interested in what we are doing in there and put them to the question. I want names and I want heads.”"

katerin.72.t:0 "The Foal"
katerin.72.d:0 "”My lord grandmaster?”, a voice asked. Erik didn’t answer. Everygriff around him sounded so far away. All his attention were focused on these eyes. These eyes void of life. That foal couldn’t have been older than twelve but its eyes seemed to have endured decades of suffering… Erik himself was only a few years older.\n\nYet Erik wasn’t a nestling anymore. He had seen death before, young and old. Living through Katerin’s endless plague would do that to you. But this, this was something else entirely. The foal didn’t die of natural causes. It had died of mistreatment and malnourishment,it looked nothing like a plague corpse. Erik could see the marks, beatings, chains, malnutrition, and worse. The foal was a unicorn but its horn had been horribly mangled, almost as if it had been cut. He had read somewhere that some witches and warlocks used unicorn’s horn dust, but Erik had never internalized the implications of that. The method of harvest…\n\n“My lord grandmaster!”, a voice insisted. Erik still didn’t answer. He felt hot, so very hot, despite the cold Katerin weather of these months…\n\nA claw grabbed his shoulder. At this very instant, Erik wanted nothing more than to snap whoever dared touch him. But he snapped out of it when he saw the concerned face of Hector Ardennson , his mentor and friend. “Erik...”\n\nErik stood up while Hector carefully covered the corpse. He gazed at the horizon. Nothing but that dead foal, grass, mud and the distant walls of Einfoort, damned Einfoort... own knights didn’t look calm either, shuffling about and trying to figure out who would do this. Erik’s eyes fell back to his trusted mentor.\n\n“Heads will roll for this.”\n\n“You shouldn’t act rashly in the face of such trag-"

katerin.73.t:0 "The Fate of the City."
katerin.73.d:0 "It had been months since the first meeting of the Inner Circle outside Einfoort but it felt like years. So much had changed. Such fools they all had been. How could the Argentumdämmerung have been so foolish as to think the plague was indeed a natural phenomenon? Now, they knew. Not all of course. So much still remained shrouded in mystery but one thing was certain : a group was hard at work, corrupting and defacing Einfoort and Katerin. For what purpose but pure maliciousness? That, they were not yet sure. Neither was what they had to do next.\n\nErik had tried his best to unite his knights but despite his popularity, he just couldn’t get his griffs to see eye to eye. He had forced Gunter and Eggert to work together but they had only radicalized as things went forward. Gunter was still convinced that Einfoort could still be saved. That what they needed to do was simply to go in and cut off the head of the salamander. He had some support. The strange happenings had brought some of the more experienced knights to his side. Eggert, on the other claw, had grown increasingly frustrated to see so little progress, so many half-measures to save a city that didn’t seem to even want to be saved. Einfoort had resisted. Knights had fallen to petty criminals during evening patrols and civilians were routinely showing disobedience to orders. Einfoort had taken its toll on the Argentumdämmerung and Eggert was determined to put an end to all of it. And he was strongly supported.\n\nErik knew that if he continued to try and balance the two, the credit his knights were giving him thanks to his birth would eventually run out. He had to choose and be decisive or he would just be seen as an indecisive child. Was Einfoort worth the sacrifices? Or was it too far gone? He finally spoke :"

katerin.74.d:0 "Erik was standing in his tent, praying to Arcturius for strength as his aides were putting his armor on. Outside, the priests were offering benedictions and prayers to all knights before their great sally into the city. But among the litanies of pious chants, Erik could also hear angry cries.\n\nFinally, one of his aide bursted into the tent. “My lord grandmaster!”\n\n“What is it? Don’t you see I am getting ready?”\n\n“Forgive my lord grandmaster but it is lords Drakkenwald and Von Strathburg. They are fighting.”\n\n“Why is it always these two… What is it this time?”\n\n“Lord Von Strathburg has been rallying the peasants. They are whipping themselves into a frenzy. Lord Drakkenwald has confronted him, accusing him of sabotaging the operations by not relying on our knights.”\n\nErik sighed. That was enough. There was no more time for pleasantries and politeness. He would remind both of them of their duty, in front of the knights and peasants and make his orders clear."

Even Gunter and his endless contestations was now resolute and silent. Like them all, he had seen too much to care again for half-measures when iron will was needed.

Finally, sanity has returned.\n\n\n Others are not just feeling hope though, but are sensing an opportunity. The Council rules for now, but will they have what it takes to hold onto power?  Even more importantly, do they have the right? Duskfeather, the once archprelate of Katerin, does not think so, and none has earned more loyalty from the peasants than him. The Knightly orders of the Silberkrallen and the Argentumdämmerung stand equally suspicious of the council’s intentions. Did they simply trade the mad princess for a bickering handful of power mongers? Plans will have to be made, deals struck and support built.

katerin.135.a:0 "I'm sure it is nothing to worry about."

katerin.136.t:0 "The Situation"
katerin.136.d:0 "The decaying settlement of Einfoort lies south of the capital. The city itself seems to be representative of Katerin as a whole, its glory days are long behind it, with years of neglectful rule and exploitation having taken a heavy toll from the once burgeoning settlement. The once proud walls of the keep have been in a state of perpetual disrepair for the last 20 years, doing little to discourage any potential attacker. The city itself has grown far beyond the boundary of the walls, with villagers fleeing from bandits and the plague taking refuge in an ever-expanding network of tents and shanties.  The city is in ruins, all that remains is its decaying cadaver, and the vultures have come to feast.\n\nWith the constant stream of refugees to the city, it was inevitable, the plague has come to Einfoort. If the city, and more importantly its inhabitants are to be saved, then decisive action must be taken.\n\nWhen news of the plague arrived at the capital, the knightly orders of Katerin stood ready to secure the city at a moment’s notice. The orders have served the principality with an upright zeal for centuries, dedicated to upholding a tradition of chivalry that stretches back hundreds of years. Two major orders have established themselves within the Principality, and both have volunteered for the task.\n\nFirstly, there is the venerable order of the Silberkralle, lead by the honorable Grandmaster Hector Ardennson.  The Silberkralle acts as the sword and the shield of the common griffon, striving to make the life of the peasants as comfortable as possible given the circumstances. The Silberkralle desires to calmly and carefully take control of the city, minimizing the danger to the common folk and granting those to sick to survive a merciful and peaceful end.\n\nThe other knightly order of Katerin, the Argentumdämmerung has also volunteered for the task. Lead by the fervent Grandmaster Erik Grimclaw, the foremost objective of the Argentumdämmerung is to pull the plague out by its roots, and reclaiming the deadlands of Katerin for the Empire. What they lack in experience they make up for in zeal, and they seek to drag the plague from the city as quickly as is possible, minimizing the risk of infection for the populace.\n\nOf course, the Orders could always be dismissed and Einfoorts garrison given the task of restoring order, but the garrison was already small and poorly maintained before the plague hit, and there is no telling what methods they might resort to."

katerin.136.b:0 "Argentumdämmerung scourges the city."
katerin.136.c:0 "The Garrison locks down the city."

katerin.137.t:0 "Einfoort in Chaos"
katerin.137.d:0 "When the orderly columns of the Silberkralle marched into Einfoort, many of its citizens saw them as divine saviors sent by Boreas himself. The Silberkralle is well known for its compassion and sympathy for the lower classes of Katerin, and their arrival gave the desperate populace of the city the glimmer of hope that they had desperately been seeking. The Talon was quick to officially relieve the beleaguered garrison of the city, who were immensely pleased that the city was now someone else's problem.\n\nA curfew was shortly enforced across the city, with the Knights of the Talon restoring order to the streets with efficiency, yet not without compassion. The Knights of the Talon have been understanding but firm, who sook to separate the diseased from the healthy and allow them to live out their final days in peace. The citizens of Einfoort were undoubtedly put at ease due to these efforts, there was a deeper meaning to them.\n\nThe Silberkralle carries with it a secret objective, they seek to establish the exact cause behind the infection, and the mysterious plague that Katerin has suffered for so long. The Knights have questioned every single sick griffon they have found with vigor, trying to find the root of the infection, and the route through which it first managed to arrive within the city.  Time will tell what secrets they uncover"
katerin.137.a:0 "We must find the root cause."

katerin.138.t:0 "Einfoort in Chaos"
katerin.138.d:0 "The Knights of the Argentumdämmerung entered Einfoort in a somber but disciplined manner. They paid no attention to the unwitting bystanders who thought help had arrived. They knew that their task would be a bloody one, that in order to save the city, the rot that lies at its core must be pulled out, and that there would be no avoiding collateral damage. But they were resigned to their bloody task for if they did not carry it out, then who would? The knights would do whatever needed to be done but they would take no pleasure from it.\n\nThe Grandmaster of the Argentumdämmerung himself, Eric Grimclaw, was leading them. He was not one to shy away from such a challenge, and he would not dream of making his loyal knights carry alone the burden of such a task. The Grimclaws could trace their ancestry all the way back to the founding of Katerin itself, and although they had lost control of the principality, the last scion of the Grimclaws still wielded great influence within his homeland.\n\nThe knights quickly took the reins off the garrison and moved to secure every quarter of the city. Every single house was to be searched for any trace of the infection, and those of the sick deemed to be beyond saving were granted a merciful end at the hands of the knights. Einfoort would be cleansed, nevermind the cost."
katerin.138.a:0 "Round up anyone suspicious."

katerin.139.t:0 "Einfoort in Chaos"
katerin.139.d:0 "When the Garrison was given the ultimate responsibility of restoring order within Einfoort, many of its denizens were relieved. Fearing that the zealotry of the Orders would only serve to increase the damage and that entrusting such a task to the garrison of the city would result in the least amount of damage to the city. But none could predict what methods the garrison would resort to, the means by which they would purify the city of the diseased. \n\nThe problems started only a few days after the garrison was given the task, when food shortages combined with a fear of the plague caused a panic amongst the peasants. The garrison found itself overwhelmed and was ultimately forced to retreat within the crumbling walls of the keep while the riot burnt itself out. This incident was clearly the last straw for the garrison, who perceived their position as untenable. Fearing for their lives and becoming ever more paranoid of the plague, the garrison took the only option that made sense to them.\n\nThey burnt the city to the ground. Gathering the remaining oil and torches contained within the keep, the garrison procededed to methodically walk through the city, setting everything they encountered ablaze, and killing all those who resisted. \n\nThe plague is gone, and Einfoort along with it. All that remains of the city are burnt ruins, and whatever poor wretches who managed to escape the blaze."
katerin.139.a:0 "Like a fever burns away a sickness."

katerin.140.t:0 "The Situation Improves"
katerin.140.d:0 "With the aid of the Silberkralle, Einfoort has been a able to stem the spread of the Plague. Knowing that the job is far from completion, Grandmaster Hector Ardensson, leader of the Silberkralle Knights, request for additional aid in order to combat the plague and to eradicate it from this dying city."
katerin.140.a:0 "Very well, you will have your aid."
katerin.140.b:0 "Enough has been given, make with what you have."

katerin.141.t:0 "A Meeting Outside Einfoort"
katerin.141.d:0 "It had been a few days since the Argentumdämmerung had arrived in Einfoort and the situation had been strenuous since. The members of the Inner Circle present met in their tent outside the city to discuss the situation. Among them stood the young Grandmaster Eric Grimclaw. Barely older than a fledgling, he stood out amongst his elders. But he embodied the idea that in souls nobly born, valour does not depend upon age. Next to him sat Eggert Von Strathburg and Gunter Drakkenwald, the two highest ranking knights of the Inner Circle. Von Strathburg had conducted the first actions in the city and his face was still veiled by grief over the death of several of his subordinates. Gunter had arrived only the day before at the head of the relief force but still managed to make himself unwelcome by criticizing the infirmaries set up by Von Strathburg’s griffs.\n\nThe knights opened their meeting by a prayer. After, Grimclaw gave the floor to Eggert. He proceeded to paint a bleak portrait of the situation. He reminded the Circle of some of the atrocities his knights witnessed in the city from some of their inhabitants. In his eyes, Einfoort was virtually lost and needed to be treated not as a city to relief but as a target to tackle with brute force. To save Einfoort would require to save it not only from the plague but from itself. Several knights banged the table in approval and Grimclaw himself seemed to agree with Von Strathburg but Gunter asked to speak. The Grandmaster allowed him.\n\n“Brothers and sisters, Grandmaster. There is no question about the valour of our knights and their sacrifices in Einfoort. Yet, I fear that we have wrongly took our Grandmaster’s call for crusade too literally. One does not tackle a plague city like a rebellious uprising. We need to care for these griffons and act with a cool head.”\n\nEggert scoffed at the remark “How dare you, brother? If you had indeed showed up in time, we might not be in the situation we are in.” Gunter glared back at the griff. “Tread carefully, Eggert. If you think boasts of brashness will grant you authority, let me remind you we are not tavern drunks listening to stories.” Eggert put his claws on the table and rose up. “I will not take insults lightly from a coward!”\n\nGrimclaw rose his claw and demanded silence “Enough.” Gunter and Eggert obeyed and sat down. “My father had absolute trust in your valour and competence. This much I know. So remember your oaths. Both sides have merit and we must stand together because..."
katerin.141.a:0 "This city is worth fighting to protect."
katerin.141.b:0 "Einfoort is rotten to the core."

katerin.142.t:0 "The Ruins of Einfoort."
katerin.142.d:0 "As the news of Einfoort's ultimate fate spreads around Katerin, panic enveloped the populace. The government had never held the best interests of the lower classes in mind, but the griffons had never imagined that it would perpetrate such a blatant atrocity against its own citizens. The common griffon had already known that the military would do little to protect them against bandits, but now every single garrison was a collection of murderers and madmen. Protests over the bonfire of Einfoort erupted in the major cities of Katerin, and those protests soon erupted into riots, ones that had to be dispersed by force.\n\nThe citizens of Katerin now flook to anyone who promises to save them from the claws of their government, with both of the Knightly Orders have received a large boost in applications to join. But not every griffon can count on the protection of the knights, limited in griffonpower as they are. For these poor wretches, there is nothing to protect them if the nearest garrison were to turn on them. They yearn for something to protect them from the abuses thrust upon them by their government and grow more radical by the day."

katerin.143.d:0 "With a lot of effort and determination, Grandmaster Hector Ardensson was able to achieve the impossible and rid the city of Einfroot from the Plague."
katerin.143.a:0 "Glory to the Silberkralle Knights!"

katerin.144.t:0 "The Streets of Einfoort."
katerin.144.d:0 "Under the leadership of Gunter Drakkenwald, the knights organized a vast plan to take back control of the streets. They enlisted the help of locals and peasants. Equipped with whatever tools available and gauze masks or protected by cloth dipped in vinegar, they began to clear the streets of whatever blocked them. Corpses were taken away to be burnt. Trash and boulders from various ruins were cleared. The infected people were brought to the dispensaries and homeless relocated to relief camps around the city to restore some semblance of order. Then pumps brought by the knights or salvaged from the local firefighters’ barracks were set up and slowly but surely, the streets began to be cleaned by the civilians under the protection of the knights. Fountains, wells and other water sources were either rigorously scrubbed or condemned. The task had not been an easy one and many of the workers fell ill themselves, despite the protections.\n\nWith the way now cleared, the knights set about establishing various outposts throughout the cities. The city’s squalor was far from purged but at least, they could now venture into the streets in a normal way."
katerin.144.a:0 "This city needs us."

katerin.145.t:0 "The Sorry State of the City."
katerin.145.d:0 "Under the guidance of Eggert Von Strathburg and grandmaster Erik Grimclaw, the knights entered Einfoort once more. This time, in force and with a clear objective cutting a way into the city. This was no easy task. The roads of Einfoort had become a mess of rubbles, abandoned carts, garbage and even corpses left to rot.\n\nFollowing a map drawn up by Gunter Drakkenwald, they got to work to clear the streets along specific lines. The peasants would gather all obstacles and burn them. In some places, buildings would be tore down to allow for easier and safer passage. As for the homeless, they were rounded up and lead to quarantined areas outside the city. The plan was to create a network to allow the Argentumdämmerung to move quickly in the city, control the movements of the population and institute a curfew. These new roads into Einfoort were quickly nicknamed the Sacred Way.\n\nAfter the knights were finally able to move unhindered once more, they spread the word to the population: the city was now under curfew. All those found in the streets during curfew would be considered rebels and shot at."

katerin.146.a:0 "Glory to the Silberkralle Knights!"

katerin.147.t:0 "Breaking and Entering."
katerin.147.d:0 "Weeks of reports gathering by the knights under Gunter Drakkenwald and Eggert Von Strathburg had begun to paint an unexpected picture of the city. The plague was behaving strangely. Reports of unrest from Eggert’s knights and maps of the epidemy from Gunter’s scholars were showing surprising patterns. The most infected parts of the city were coinciding with the more unruly parts of the city, which, according to the locals weren’t even the old bad neighborhoods. Worse, some witnesses. While Eggert and Gunter were arguing about the value of their respective information’s, Grandmaster Grimclaw pounced on it with the confidence of youth. He ordered an immediate investigation into these places.\n\nAfter sunset, the knights quietly took to the streets in small units. Armed with sledgehammers, they broke into all suspect buildings. Many of the knights found only corpses, terrorized inhabitants or simply dust. But in a few cases, what they found was unlike anything they had ever seen. They found perfectly maintained workshops in otherwise rundown neighborhoods. They had found nogriff there but some poor souls in cages, dead or in the state of apathy that characterized the late stages of the plague. Instead of tools, the buildings were full of strange substances, notably a strangle white-ish powder. One knight who grew up in a butcher’s family noticed how oddly close it was to bone meal. Documents were seized, written in a foreign language that nogriff seemed to recognize at first glance. And most ominously, they found crates of relief food, with markings from the temples of Eyr, the princely authorities or, even more worryingly, the knightly orders themselves.\n\nThe findings were put under the surveillance of selected knights unanimously trusted by the Inner Circle and all involved in the search were sworn to secrecy. In addition, a rigorous inspection of all food reserves was ordered."
katerin.147.a:0 "Time to see what we can find inside."

katerin.148.t:0 "Culling the Plague."
katerin.148.d:0 "Over weeks, knight Eggert Von Strathburg and grandmaster Erik Grimclaw had grown closer. They were both at Einfoort during the early days of the crusade and they had seen the disaster that it was before Gunter and the critics got there, after they had begun their work. They knew that to call what they had over Einfoort control was overly optimistic and that it could easily be reverted. Some parts of the city were lost to the plague and unrest or were simply about to collapse or burn down, possibly taking entire blocks with them. They needed to take radical actions.\n\nThe knights had begun to mark down the situation of the city in the streets by painting symbols in Argentumdämmerung code over the doors and at the entrance of the streets. They also had at their disposals some maps that the scholars under Gunter had drawn up. Eggert then devised a plan and presented it to Erik who heartily agreed. He too felt that difficult measures had to be taken.\n\nOver the next few days, knights were ordered to begin to evacuate buildings and areas that were deemed too dangerous to be left alone. To prevent any delay, the knights were order to break in and order the immediate departure of the inhabitants. Those that did not would be forced out and put under quarantine. Then, the buildings and areas would be burned down."

katerin.149.a:0 "With the source gone, hopefully the plague will die out with it."

katerin.150.t:0 "The Fate of the City."
katerin.150.d:0 "It had been months since the first meeting of the Inner Circle outside Einfoort but it felt like years. So much had changed. Such fools they all had been. How could the Argentumdämmerung have been so foolish as to think the plague was indeed a natural phenomenon? Now, they knew. Not all of course. So much still remained shrouded in mystery but one thing was certain a group was hard at work, corrupting and defacing Einfoort and Katerin. For what purpose but pure maliciousness? That, they were not yet sure. Neither was what they had to do next.\n\nErik had tried his best to unite his knights but despite his popularity, he just couldn’t get his griffs to see eye to eye. He had forced Gunter and Eggert to work together but they had only radicalized as things went forward. Gunter was still convinced that Einfoort could still be saved. That what they needed to do was simply to go in and cut off the head of the salamander. He had some support. The strange happenings had brought some of the more experienced knights to his side. Eggert, on the other claw, had grown increasingly frustrated to see so little progress, so many half-measures to save a city that didn’t seem to even want to be saved. Einfoort had resisted. Knights had fallen to petty criminals during evening patrols and civilians were routinely showing disobedience to orders. Einfoort had taken its toll on the Argentumdämmerung and Eggert was determined to put an end to all of it. And he was strongly supported.\n\nErik knew that if he continued to try and balance the two, the credit his knights were giving him thanks to his birth would eventually run out. He had to choose and be decisive or he would just be seen as an indecisive child. Was Einfoort worth the sacrifices? Or was it too far gone? He finally spoke"

katerin.151.d:0 "As they looked upon the dark clouds of smoke coming out of Einfoort, Erik and his knights looked grim. The deed had been done. The crusade for Einfoort had come to an end. It hadn’t been easy. Much had been sacrificed in the name of the gods and duty. Some had faltered but, in the end, they stood united. Even Gunter and his endless contestations was now resolute and silent. Like them all, he had seen too much to care again for half-measures when iron will be needed. Einfoort was now cleansed but it was not yet time to stand down or rest..."
