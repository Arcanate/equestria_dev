katerin.1.d:0 "By the end of last year, in the last week of December, Princess Katalina called for a grand ball to be held in Katerinburg. However she was not impressed with the amenities of the Halls that had already existed. In response she had numerous Griffons pulled from across the Principality to tear down the oldest building and construct a new grand hall. However, with little time to plan and complete the project the concept had to be based on older designs and the laborers be worked for every single day with no rest until it was completed, lest the Principality face the wrath of her not having her way. By the end of it, numerous workers had vanished, been executed, or simply worked to death, but the Princess had her Ball."
