### Ideas ###

KAT_the_mad_princess:0 "The Mad Princess"
KAT_the_mad_princess_desc:0 "The Title held by Diellza Von Katerin the insane within her Principality and beyond. Even the most diehard monarchist are forced to concede that the princess in Katerinburg embodies the trappings of hereditary rule. There is no escape from a mad ruler. Her insanity has driven many civil servants and advisors away from her court and makes finding people to work with her government a difficult task. Her antics have ruined whatever remained of Katerin's reputation amongst the Herzlanders. She has attained the dubious achievement of making Katerin known worldwide as a buffoon state. At best."

KAT_endless_plague:0 "Endless Plague"
KAT_endless_plague_desc:0 "For years plague has beset the lands of Katerin. Many blame the squalor the people lives in under the uncaring Princess' rule. Some see it as a curse, a divine punishment for her paranoid isolation from the Imperial court. Yet the plague has been tormenting Katerin long before the Von Katerin house even began their rule. However, it has only gotten worse as the empire began to weaken, like an infected organ in a dying man. Perhaps there is some wisdom to the Princess' madnes. She may well seek to protect the people from the Plague, just not Katerin's..."
KAT_plague_fighting:0 "Fighting the Plague"
KAT_the_Deadlands:0 "The Deadlands"
KAT_the_Deadlands_desc:0 "Katerin has long been known as a deadweight to the Empire. The fact that this insulting term became coopted by the locals and eventually morphed into the term "Deadlands" is a testament to the scale of societal collapse that happened here. The cursed lands of Katerin have suffered routine crop failures for years now. The livestock is sick and feeble, not unlike its citizens. The loss of access to the Evi Valley rice after the beginning of the Prywhen civil war didn't even matter for Katerin has virtually nothing to trade for it. Some blame the Princess' refusal to industrialize but in truth, the rural system having long crumbled made it a pipedream anyway."

KAT_faint_of_faith_desc:0 "It is a common idea that crisis brings even the most skeptic griffs to religion. Katerin proved it true but eventually became a demonstration of its corollary. As the Crisis in the Principality grows worse, more and more Griffons are turning away from worship and prayer, their faith utterly broken by the reality that surrounds them.

### Advisors ###

### National Focuses ###

KAT_do_own_work:0 "Diellza in Control"
KAT_do_own_work_desc:0 "With matters finally resolved, the time has come to cement Diellzas authority within the principality. The princess herself has little interest in the minute of such a task, and has thus decided delegated large portions of the matter to the Katerintreue. Time will tell if such a decision proves wise."
KAT_assign_yesmen:0 "Expand The Katerintreue"
KAT_assign_yesmen_desc:0 "The Katerintreue as it stands is too small to effectively manage the entire principality, and it must thus be expanded. There is no shortage of ambitious griffons looking for a spot in the Katerintreue, and quite a few favors can be earned in exchange for a favorable assignment within it."
KAT_infiltrate_the_orders:0 "Infiltrate the Orders"
KAT_infiltrate_the_orders_desc:0 "The knightly orders of Katerin have never been very comfortable with the reign of the princess and the Katerintreue. Many within the government fear that they may be plotting to overthrow them. To ensure that such an attempt would be discovered before it can be carried out, several agents of the Katerintreue started to infiltrate the orders, hoping to subvert their power by any means nessicary."
KAT_peasant_yesmen:0 "Peasants in the Katerintreue"
KAT_peasant_yesmen_desc:0 "While the Katerintreue may have started out as a noble council, advising the princess on the day to day management of the principality, the growing influence of the organization has made membership a coveted prize within Katerin. Allowing some of the more influential peasants to have a seat on the table will earn us a few valuable favors, and will surely calm the rabble a bit as well."
KAT_pocketed_yeogriffs:0 "Katerintreue Yeogriffs"
KAT_pocketed_yeogriffs_desc:0 "As the infiltration of the knightly orders continues to its next phase, several of our agents have found themselves in lite to be promoted to the position of Yeogriff. If promoted they would be in a much better position to report in on the activities of the guild. Needless to say, supporting these agents should be a priority in the coming weeks."
KAT_armed_taxmen:0 "Armed Tax Collectors"
KAT_armed_taxmen_desc:0 "The griffons of Katerin are, to put it bluntly, destitute. Extracting tax revenues from them is akin to drawing blood from a stone. The solution to this issue is, of course, to smash the stone with a hammer.  From this point onwards, the royal tax collectors of Katerin will carry arms wherever they go, in order to "incentivize" the proper payment of taxes by the populace."
KAT_legalize_banditry:0 "Legalize Banditry"
KAT_legalize_banditry_desc:0 "Katerin barely possesses enough conscripts to keep the main cities and towns safe, and scouring the bandits from the countryside would be an impossible task for our meager forces to accomplish. But recently an... unorthodox solution to the problem of banditry has been presented to the Katerintreue by the Princess, what if banditry were legal?"
KAT_enforcers_of_her_will:0 "Katerintreue Enforcers"
KAT_enforcers_of_her_will_desc:0 "With the bandits now loyal to Katerin, the task of taking full control of the countryside has become possible. But a problem lies with the serfs living in said countryside, they are rather reluctant to serve a government that has done little to help them. Such disobedience cannot be tolerated, and the enforcers of the Katerintreue will make it clear that they have little choice in the matter."
KAT_define_territory:0 "Define Territory"
KAT_define_territory_desc:0 "The newly created enforcers have proven most enthusiastic in carrying out their work, perhaps a bit too enthusiastic. While they do serve the purpose of cowing the serfs excellently, whenever two enforcers meet the result is often far from pretty. The enforcers tend to clash on the ownership of “tax revenues”, and unless the territory of each enforcer is strictly defined, things will continue to get worse."
KAT_enforce_corvee:0 "Remind the Citizens of Their Duty"
KAT_enforce_corvee_desc:0 "As the enforcers of the Katerintreue now patrol the countryside, and the serfs have been reminded of the price of disobedience, the time has come to put them to work. Katerin is in shambles, and reconstructing it is a daunting task. If we are ever to turn the deadlands into profitable parcels of territory, then the serfs must be worked to the bone."
KAT_kat_march_railroad:0 "Katerinburg Railroad"
KAT_kat_march_railroad_desc:0 "Katerinburg, while being the capital of the principality, is a far cry from a modern city. The city itself is plagued with poverty and crime, and a proper railroad connecting it to the rest of the country was never realized, due to the dangers of the surrounding swamp. This state of affairs cannot be tolerated any longer, and the Katerintreue has ordered that rails be laid no matter how many serf lives it takes."
KAT_link_einfoort:0 "Link Lingermill"
KAT_link_einfoort_desc:0 "As the capital now possesses a functioning rail lines, the prospect of linking Lingermill with the capital is now possible. A direct connection between Katerinburg and Andorstadt would cut down on many weeks of travel through treacherous countryside. Some may consider the working conditions needed to establish said rail connection to be dangerous, but such ideas are of no concern to Diellza."
KAT_furstentumwerke_katalina:0 "Fürstentumwerke Diellza"
KAT_furstentumwerke_katalina_desc:0 "Katerin is, to put it bluntly, an industrial backwater. The sheer chaos of the last few years drow away any foreign investment, and any griffon who possessed enough money to fun a factory would much rather spend said money on fleeing from Katerin than investing in it. But with the recent increase in tax revenues, the possibility of the government funding a few factories of its own has been brought up."
KAT_mines_of_andorstadt:0 "Mines of Andorstadt"
KAT_mines_of_andorstadt_desc:0 "Andorstadt is the largest city within Lingermill, and was once the seat of very profitable mines that supported the city's economy. Sadly, the chaos that engulfed the principality, coupled with labor shortages forced the mines to permanently close. But with the Katerintreue now establishing order, a plan using a few prisoners and serfs to reopen them under the authority of the Katerintreue has started."
KAT_trades_education:0 "Trades Education"
KAT_trades_education_desc:0 "The Katerintreue has finally managed to wretch enough control away from the princess to make a proper, if limited, system of education. Rather than the system that Diellza started, that is forcing griffons into a library to read books at random, an education system based around teaching young griffons valuable trades shall be adopted. This is by far the most popular action the Katerintreue has ever taken."
KAT_stahlfabrik_katerinburg:0 "Stahlfabrik Katerinburg"
KAT_stahlfabrik_katerinburg_desc:0 "The mines of Andorstadt now supply the capital with a steady source of iron, and the abundance of the material supplied by the mines has given the industrialists of the Katerintreue an idea. A steel works within the capital would be the most advanced building in the entire principality, and a drain on the treasury. But the long term advantages provided by such a building far outweigh the initial cost of constructing it."
KAT_steam_pump_land_reclaimation:0 "Mechanical Land Reclaimation"
KAT_steam_pump_land_reclaimation_desc:0 "Thanks to the large increases in “tax” revenue the Katerintreue have brought to the principality, the purchase of several trucks, tractors and steam pumps to clear out more swamplands around the capital has begun. These machines will not only serve the purpose of expanding the amount of arable land around the capital, but for a larger push of industrialization across the country too. "
KAT_bribe_those_with_power:0 "Bribe Those in Power"
KAT_bribe_those_with_power_desc:0 "While the Katerintreue holds much sway over the laws of Katerin, it does not yet wield absolute power within the principality. The occasional noble lord still complains about the situation within the principality, with some even daring to write letters to the capital demanding action. With the new tax revenue, we can fix this."
KAT_loyal_gang_bosses:0 "Loyal Gang Bosses"
KAT_loyal_gang_bosses_desc:0 "While normally trusting the leader of a group of bandits is an unwise proposition, this situation in Katerin is far from normal. In particular, several of the gang bosses we have dealt with in the past have proven to be very agreeable to working for the government, especially when certain “incentives” are presented."
KAT_serfs_clear_marshes:0 "Use Serfs to Clear the Marshland"
KAT_serfs_clear_marshes_desc:0 "In order to salvage this disaster of a principality, sacrifices will have to be made. The vast marshlands in Katerin could be put to good use if only the dangerous task of clearing them were accomplished, and compared to the economic advantages such an endeavor would bring, the lives of a few serfs are a pittance."
KAT_increase_peonage_conscripts:0 "Increase Peonage Conscripts"
KAT_increase_peonage_conscripts_desc:0 "The current armed forces under the direct control of the Katerintreue are, to put it bluntly, pathetic. If we are to reclaim control of the countryside then our forces must be drastically expanded, and while former prisoners might not make for the best of soldiers, they do fill out the ranks quite nicely."
KAT_ganger_armies:0 "Punish Disloyalty"
KAT_ganger_armies_desc:0 "Although we have been tolerant of the excesses that our bandit allies are prone to take, the time has come to make it clear that their loyalty and competence is the only thing keeping them alive. Any bandit too ineffective or disloyal will be removed from the principality, permanently."
KAT_rough_diamonds:0 "Rough Diamonds"
KAT_rough_diamonds_desc:0 "The minor nobility of Katerin have spent years fighting and ruling in the countryside, and many of them possess a wealth of experience that utterly dwarfs the average peasant conscript. With enough training and a sense of discipline, perhaps these lordlings could be turned into something more effective."
KAT_investigate_knights:0 "Investigate the Knights"
KAT_investigate_knights_desc:0 "Thanks to the efforts of our agents within the knightly orders, we have gathered enough “evidence” of their “crimes” to start a public inquiry on their transgressions against Katerin and its citizens. As long as the trial goes well, the last opponents of the Katerintreue will be permanently crippled."
KAT_punish_disloyalty:0 "Ganger Armies"
KAT_punish_disloyalty_desc:0 "Even though they do have their peculiarities, it cannot be denied that the gangs now loyal to us are superior to the old peasant militias in nearly every aspect. The ganger units have proven so effective that the idea of phasing out the militias entirely and replacing them with gangs at a permanent basis might not be a bad one."
KAT_warlords_of_katerin:0 "The Warlords of Katerin"
KAT_warlords_of_katerin_desc:0 "As the final militias are replaced by their bandit counterparts, ceirtan quirks within our ranks have made themselves clear. Although they may be battle hardened, rival gangs are more likely to fight each other than the enemy, and their leaders expect more autonomy than the old officers. Katerin has thus been divided between these warlords, with each gang leader effectively a vassal of the Katerintreue."
KAT_clean_the_ranks:0 "Clean the Ranks"
KAT_clean_the_ranks_desc:0 "As the bandits of Katerin are trained into a fully effective military force, it has become clear that their ranks are bloated with the lazy and the incompetent. These griffons have outlived their usefulness, and their former comrades are all too eager to clear out this rot in their ranks."
KAT_clean_house:0 "Clean House"
KAT_clean_house_desc:0 "With the best of the bandits now firmly loyal to the Katerintreue, we finally have the force of arms to remove our remaining enemies from the principality. The few surviving disloyal bandits, the nobles not already within the Katerintreue and any members of the court a bit too loyal to the princess, all will be dealt with in a permanent fashion."
KAT_block_resources_out_east:0 "Embargo the East"
KAT_block_resources_out_east_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, the knights continue to be the lone obstacle standing in between the Katerintreue and complete dominance of Katerin. Inciting them to outright rebellion might be the only way to get rid of them at this point, and blocking any shipments to their lands certainly seems like a good place to start."
KAT_a_test:0 "Test the Knights"
KAT_a_test_desc:0 "Although the Princess is rapidly outliving her welcome, her eccentricities do have their uses. Perhaps we should listen to her order for the knights to do something so utterly insane that they will be forced to refuse. Which will prove to be the catalyst we are looking for. "
KAT_depose_katalina:0 "Depose Diellza"
KAT_depose_katalina_desc:0 "The time has come. Every single griffon with influence wants Princess Diellza gone, and the mad princess so deluded she thinks that she still controls the principality has far outlived her usefulness. No matter the differences we have, there is no griffon in Katerin will argue against this act."
KAT_a_new_dawn:0 "New Dawn Over Katerin"
KAT_a_new_dawn_desc:0 "With the mad princess finally out of the way and with tentative aid of the prelate and the knights, the Katerintreue now rules unchallenged within Katerin. A new dawn rises upon the deadlands, and it is one heralded by the Katerintreue, ready to reap the rewards of their long labour."
KAT_the_spanner:0 "Welcome Industrialists Into The Council"
KAT_the_spanner_desc:0 "A number of the wealthier industrialists in Katerin have expressed their concern that their interests are not being properly represented within the Katerintreue. Naturally, the most successful griffons in the Principality must have their voices heard by the government, especially when certain incentives are offered in return."

KAT_deal_with_corpses:0 "Dealing with the Corpses"
KAT_deal_with_corpses_desc:0 "With the garrison now in full control of the city of Einfoort. They must deal with the plague ridden corpses left behind by this particularly nasty wave of prestilence. How they handle the task is still up in the air..."
KAT_close_the_gates:0 "Close the Gates"
KAT_close_the_gates_desc:0 "This city is plagued, that much is clear. Now we have to keep it contained. The city of Einfoort shall be on lockdown until further notice. May Boreas have mercy on all those left inside."
KAT_burn_everything:0 "Burn Everything"
KAT_burn_everything_desc:0 "The city is truly in rough shape. Even now there are still hundreds if not thousands of plague ridden Griffons, clothing, food, even water stores. Nothing can be spared, if we are to overcome this it must all burn."
KAT_they_have_airpods:0 "Alert the Peasantry"
KAT_they_have_airpods_desc:0 "Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of the garrison, preventing mourning family members and curious onlookers from investigating Einfoort has proven to be an impossible task. Although keeping the exact details of the events that occurred within that forsaken city would be ideal, the common folk must be warned of the danger that the ruins pose, lest another outbreak start."
KAT_oh_god_oh_fuck:0 "An Update"
KAT_oh_god_oh_fuck_desc:0 "A letter from Katerinburg has recently arrived at the Garrisons temporary headquarters outside the city. And, as it turns out, the Katerintreue is less than pleased with the Garrisons creative interpretation of their orders, as well as their version of what constitutes the truth."
KAT_salvage_the_situation:0 "Salvaging the Situation"
KAT_salvage_the_situation_desc:0 "As the letter from Katerinburg made quite clear, the current policy of keeping the peasantry away from the remains of the city is less than ideal. The common folk must be let back into the city, to prevent the spread of the plague at the very least, and the Garrison must at least put in a token effort of patrolling the streets."
KAT_under_the_rug:0 "Make A Cover Story"
KAT_under_the_rug_desc:0 "The truth behind the events that occurred within Einfoort must never make it outside of the city, and preferably it must be stamped out within the city itself. A few convenient scapegoats will hopefully draw the attention away from the Garrison. And Boreas knows what would happen if the knights were ever to discover the truth."
KAT_oh_no_we_are_too_late:0 "Out of Claw"
KAT_oh_no_we_are_too_late_desc:0 "The previous estimates of the number of griffons carrying the plague within Einfoort had always been suspiciously low, but after a serious investigation, the true scale of this issue has dawned on us. The infection is spreading at an exponential rate, even after the measures that were taken by the garrison. It is clear that more decisive actions must be taken. "
KAT_this_whole_city:0 "Condemn the Lost"
KAT_this_whole_city_desc:0 "Even after the city was burnt, the sick of Einfoort were still allowed to live and flee to the countryside. This was clearly a mistake, those who are sick with the plague are truly beyond saving, granting them a quick death at this point is only mercy."
KAT_must_be_purged:0 "The Cull Across Katerin"
KAT_must_be_purged_desc:0 "Although Einfoort is cleansed of the filth that once infested it, the issue of the infected across the entire principality has yet to be addressed. They must be cleansed. Every griffon showing only the slightest symptoms of the plague will be culled, at this point, it is the only way to save Katerin from destruction by this infernal disease. "

KAT_the_search_begins:0 "The Search Begins"
KAT_the_search_begins_desc:0 "If the root cause of this plague is ever to be found, a thorough search of the entirety of Einfoort must be conducted. Every house must be examined, every possible way for the plague to enter the city must be investigated. The Knights of the Silberkralle will get to the bottom of this conundrum, no matter what it takes."
KAT_tend_to_the_sick:0 "Tend to the Ill"
KAT_tend_to_the_sick_desc:0 "Although the investigation of the plague must remain the primary focus of the Silberkralle, that does not mean ignoring the plight of the sick griffons within the city. Their transition from this world to the next will be made as comfortable as possible, it is the least we could do."
KAT_isolate_plague:0 "Isolate the Plague"
KAT_isolate_plague_desc:0 "Through a careful investigation of the city by our valiant knights, the areas where the plague is most concentrated have been identified, and the next phase of the investigation can start. The sick will also be isolated to those areas, to prevent them from spreading the plague further."
KAT_the_source:0 "Find the Source"
KAT_the_source_desc:0 "We are getting closer and closer to the source of all this madness, and along with it comes a troubling realization. While the possibility seemed extremely remote at first, the prospect that this plague was unleashed upon Einfoort deliberately, rather than spreading through natural means. "
KAT_clean_alms:0 "Sanitation Improvements"
KAT_clean_alms_desc:0 "Einfoort is far from the most modern city, and it's deteriorated state did little to improve its sanitation system. The city must be cleaned, waste must be properly disposed of and infected wells must be identified and closed."
KAT_outside_grain:0 "Import Clean Grain"
KAT_outside_grain_desc:0 "There is something wrong with the grain in Einfoort, and it is looking more and more likely that it was one of the vectors through which the infection pierced the city. Importing clean grain from the other provinces of Katerin, although expensive, might do much to slow the infection."
KAT_a_calm_over_einfoort:0 "A Calm over Einfoort"
KAT_a_calm_over_einfoort_desc:0 "Through the tireless efforts of the Silberkralle, the chaos and desperation that once enveloped Einfoort has all but disappeared. The sick are being dealt with in a humane way, and the city has started on the long road to recovery."
KAT_research_plague:0 "Study the Plague"
KAT_research_plague_desc:0 "After the careful investigation the Silberkralle conducted within Einfoort, the possibility of this plague being some mundane malady seems ever more unlikely. This plage is a magical construct, one of frightening power and potency."
KAT_consecration_and_prayer:0 "Consecration of Einfoort"
KAT_consecration_and_prayer_desc:0 "If this plague is truly some unholy construct, then perhaps consecrating Einfoort could provide some slim protection against its effects. And even if the consecration itself has no direct effect, the peace of mind it will give the denizens of the city will be no small matter."
KAT_investigate_rumors:0 "Look into Rumors"
KAT_investigate_rumors_desc:0 "Rumors of cloaked figures traveling across the city at night, chanting eerie hymns under the cover of darkness, have dominated the city for the past several days. Although some of the more senior knights have their doubts, these rumors might be the final lead we need to close this case for good."
KAT_the_foal:0 "The Foal"
KAT_the_foal_desc:0 "The situation in Einfoort has become so intriguing that the grandmaster of the Silberkralle himself, Hector Andersson, has arrived to oversee the operation. Upon his arrival, the Grandmaster will join the knights patrolling the outskirts of the city for a time, before moving further into the city to officially take charge of the operation."
KAT_peace_in_pieces:0 "Peace in Pieces"
KAT_peace_in_pieces_desc:0 "The troubling revelations the Grandmaster discovered on the outskirts of the city has placed the current peaceful situation of Einfoort into doubt. There are dark forces at work within the city, and they must be confronted before it is too late."
KAT_chase:0 "Chase"
KAT_chase_desc:0 "The leader of the madmen behind this insanity has managed to slip from our grasp, but the Grandmaster and his most trusted knights are hot on his trail. If we manage to corner the mastermind behind all this suffering and death, an opportunity to put an end to it all might present itself."

KAT_house_to_house:0 "House to House"
KAT_house_to_house_desc:0 "Even the most pessimistic reports couldn’t prepare us for what our knights witnessed in and around Einfoort. The city is not merely struck by plague, it is a festering swamp masquerading as a city ! We must act quickly lest all of Katerin might very well finally vanish. Our holy duty begins !"
KAT_clean_up_the_streets:0 "Clean the Streets"
KAT_clean_up_the_streets_desc:0 "The streets themselves have become vectors to the spread of disease and the chaos have left them in such a state that our knights can barely move around unhindered. Our first steps must be to eliminate the filth there. Without mobility, we are lost."
KAT_urban_crusade:0 "An Urban Crusade"
KAT_urban_crusade_desc:0 "Our knights have begun to map the city and the spread of disease. Now, we can begin to divide into areas according to their situation. The squalor in some parts of the city has gone well past the point of no return and must be evacuated and burned down to prevent further spread."
KAT_destroy_the_sources:0 "Crush the Hotspots"
KAT_destroy_the_sources_desc:0 "The gathering of information has lead us to notice some irregular activities in small parts of the city, parts of the city which infection rate is far above the already dire norm. We’ll have to investigate."
KAT_black_market_discovery:0 "Unearthed Black Markets"
KAT_black_market_discovery_desc:0 "Strange testimonies have been gathered. Stories of screams coming seemingly from the sewers or. While this may all be due to the delusions of the sicks, we must investigate."
KAT_the_foal_i:0 "The Foal"
KAT_the_foal_i_desc:0 "A dead foal has been spotted near the city, well outside the quarantined areas. Not a fledgling, a foal. In Katerin. Grandmaster Grimdawn and the leadership have been called to investigate this astonishing discovery."
KAT_the_fate_of_einfoort:0 "The Fate of Einfoort"
KAT_the_fate_of_einfoort_desc:0 "The crusade is well under way but the situation remains absolutely dire. A meeting of the Inner Circle has been called in the camp to discuss the situation and decide what is to be done, now that we have regained some semblance of control."
KAT_rally_the_knights:0 "Rally The Knights"
KAT_rally_the_knights_desc:0 "Our crusade on Einfoort has been a soul-crushing affair. Our knights are exhausted and demoralized. Yet, the flames of duty and faith still burns in their heart. We must revive it and rally our brothers and sisters for one last push in Einfoort."
KAT_cry_havoc:0 "Rally the People"
KAT_cry_havoc_desc:0 "Many in Einfoort have fallen to the plague or let themselves be overtaken by sin. But not all. Some have found inspiration in our crusade and have begun to help in our tasks. As our goal grows near, we must gather their help."
KAT_march_into_darkness:0 "Into the Heart of Darkness"
KAT_march_into_darkness_desc:0 "Our crusade nears its end. Our purpose is clear and our resolve has never been stronger. Today, we sally forward. Not to a glorious battle, but once more into the darkness of Einfoort !"
KAT_the_battle_for_katerin:0 "The Battle For Katerin"
KAT_the_battle_for_katerin_desc:0 "Einfoort has been a trial like never before for our knights. And yet, we have prevailed. But we now know with absolute certainty that our mission does not end here. We need to take the battle to all of Katerin !"

KAT_form_the_council:0 "Form The New Regency"
KAT_form_the_council_desc:0 "With the mad princess consigned to the annals of history, the time has come for Katerin to receive a government that is, at the very least, not headed by an insane head of state. Several interest groups seek representation on the council, from religious socialists to the knightly orders that have maintained what little security there is to find in Katerin during Diellzas reign."
KAT_host_the_prelate:0 "Host The Prelate"
KAT_host_the_prelate_desc:0 "The previous administration had, to put it lightly, a strained relationship with the church. But with Diellza gone, old enemies are quickly becoming new friends. Prelate Duskfeather is the most influential clergyman within Katerin, and through him, it would be possible to gain the attention of the church as a whole. Inviting the griffin to dinner would be a good start indeed."
KAT_delegate_power:0 "Delegate More Power"
KAT_delegate_power_desc:0 "Prelate Duskfeather has shown a most useful aptitude for the matters of state, managing to quickly and efficiently go through the many daily tasks that are required to keep the principality functioning. It would be foolish to let such talent go to waste, and delegating more power to the prelate would surely make the Katerinterue more popular amongst the clergy, a fact that would be most useful in maintaining order within Katerin."
KAT_clergy_in_ktreue:0 "Clergy In The Katerintreue"
KAT_clergy_in_ktreue_desc:0 "As Prelate Duskfeathers genius has shown us, the clergy is the organization which is most capable of aiding our efforts in managing the country. By formally inviting members of the Clergy to take positions within the Katerintreue, we can solidify our alliance with the church. And together we can lead Katerin to a future of piety and prosperity for every griffon."
KAT_allow_peasant_organization:0 "Allow For Peasant Cooperation"
KAT_allow_peasant_organization_desc:0 "For many years, the peasants of Katerin have been banned from organizing even the smallest popular movement, under the misguided notion that the griffons helping each other to survive twould somehow lead to a communist revolution. This ends today, as peasant organizations will finally be allowed in Katerin, letting peasants pool together their resources to create something greater."
KAT_merchants_and_landowners:0 "Broaden The Katerintreue"
KAT_merchants_and_landowners_desc:0 "The Katerintreue must represent every facet of society within Katerin, it cannot remain confined to a few political elites and connected clergy members. If it is to be a government which has the best interests of its subjects at heart, then every subject must be represented within it. While we cannot invite the peasants to lead quite yet, the middle class remains unrepresented within the government, and that must change."
KAT_denounce_archons:0 "Denounce The Archons"
KAT_denounce_archons_desc:0 "Although Prelate Duskfeather is a pious griffon, he is also a griffon that understands the plight the everygriffon goes through trying to survive. But there is nothing pious or holy about the Archons, who sit in their Ivory towers unaware of the hardships that the common folk endure. True piety is found within the common priests, who humbly tend to their flock, without making claims of rulership over the Church."
KAT_popular_front:0 "Form the Popular Front"
KAT_popular_front_desc:0 "The peasants of Katerin must not only be able to cooperate in economic matters, but must also be allowed to defend themselves against the numerous bandits that infest the countryside, many of which were formerly in the employ of the Katerintreue. These militia units will also come in handy if the Principality is ever under threat from outside forces. "
KAT_blessings_of_the_three:0 "Religious Socialism"
KAT_blessings_of_the_three_desc:0 "While religion is often seen as a bulwark of rightism and conservatism that stands in the way of socialism, that need not necessarily be the case. Does not the church preach kindness, and the importance of sharing your bread with your fellow griffon. The road to true socialism lies through religion, and the road to true piety lies through socialism. "
KAT_local_ktreue_reps:0 "Local Organizations"
KAT_local_ktreue_reps_desc:0 "The cooperatives and the militias are simply not enough, if the poor masses of Katerin are to be truly freed from their shackles, then they must be allowed to form local organizations to govern themselves. No longer will the peasants be beholden to the whims of some petty lord or landowner, they will choose their own leaders and their own laws. All in accordance with the principles of religious socialism. "
KAT_reconcile_the_orders:0 "Reconcile With The Orders"
KAT_reconcile_the_orders_desc:0 "The Silberkralle and the Argentumdammerug not only have the support of a wide section of the populace but are also the largest and most effective military forces within Katerin that are not directly controlled by the government. Mending the damage that Diellzas insane commands did on our relationship with the orders should be our priority, lest we face the might of the orders head-on."
KAT_knightly_autonomy:0 "Grant The Knights Autonomy"
KAT_knightly_autonomy_desc:0 "The knightly orders were the sole authority keeping any semblance of order within Katerin for years, and as such, they have a great deal of experience in dealing with the peasants. Granting them more autonomy within their lands will allow them to put said knowledge to good use, as well as earning us some goodwill that will no doubt be useful in the future."
KAT_support_of_arden:0 "Support For The Silberkralle"
KAT_support_of_arden_desc:0 "The Silver talon is the more moderate knightly order of the two, and is strongly supported by their vassals as just and compassionate lords. There have even been rumors of veterans of the republican revolution secretly supporting them. Perhaps the republican dream did not die a final death all those years ago..."
KAT_contact_republicans:0 "Contact Republicans"
KAT_contact_republicans_desc:0 "Grandmaster Hector Andersson is a venerable griffon, having served as the leader of the Silberkralle for decades. During all that time, he made a few contacts within movements that would have been considered treasonous while Katerin was still part of the Empire. But seeing as the Empire no longer holds any authority in Katerin, it might be time to draw some old friends out of hiding."
KAT_expand_mining:0 "Mining Expansion"
KAT_expand_mining_desc:0 "Some of Katerins richest ore veins lie within the autonomous territory of the Silberkralle, providing the order with the means to arm and train their fresh recruits. Expanding these mines to not only serve the Knights but the whole of Katerin would provide us with many materials we badly need for our military production."
KAT_undermine_ktreue:0 "Undermine The Regency"
KAT_undermine_ktreue_desc:0 "Although the Katerintreue has attempted to reform, the fact remains that still represents the hereditary line of Katerin that holds absolute power over the principality, and the Silberkralle has experienced first hand the dangers of such a system. A few choice words to the right people and the occasional covert action would do much to undermine the legitimacy of the Katerintreue."
KAT_squash_socialists:0 "Squash The Socialists"
KAT_squash_socialists_desc:0 "Despite the republican inclination of the Silberkralle, they remain a conservative and traditionalist organization at heart. A healthy democracy cannot survive with socialist parties openly advocating for the destruction of that very same democracy. These socialists must be crushed at an early stage before their rot has time to set in."
KAT_reignite_their_hearts:0 "Reignite The Flame"
KAT_reignite_their_hearts_desc:0 "Years ago, republicanism spread across the entirety of the heartlands like a great blaze, engulfing the old order of the empire, and almost reducing it to cinders. Although the flame of the republican revolution was extinguished all those years ago, embers remain. And it would only take a small spark for the blaze to flare up, and consume Katerin once more."
KAT_support_of_grimtal:0 "Support For Erik Grimclaw"
KAT_support_of_grimtal_desc:0 "Many decades ago, when katerin was not yet part of the Griffonian empire, the Grimclaw line ruled over these lands, bringing prosperity and peace to a beleaguered populace. This all changed when the Empire chose to support the Katerins instead, but now that the line of Katerin has shown a dangerous inclination towards insanity, perhaps the heir to the Grimclaw bloodline would make a better ruler. "
KAT_rightful_heir:0 "The Rightful Heir"
KAT_rightful_heir_desc:0 "Eric Grimclaw is the rightful heir to the principality of Katerin, but as it stands, there are not many who even remember a time when the Grimclaws ruled the principality. The griffons of Katerin must be reminded of their old history, and their true lord. "
KAT_the_old_blood:0 "Support From The Old Blood"
KAT_the_old_blood_desc:0 "There are many conservative elements within the upper echelons of society that support maintaining the monarchy, and even though the Katerins have proven themselves completely incapable of upholding their duties. If a far more qualified claimant to the principality were to declare themselves the rightful heir, there is no doubt that many would support them. "
KAT_three_step_plan:0 "The Three Step Plan"
KAT_three_step_plan_desc:0 ""
KAT_grandmaster_and_prince:0 "Grandmaster And Prince"
KAT_grandmaster_and_prince_desc:0 "The time has come for Eric Grimclaw to officially declare himself the rightful Prince of Katerin, reclaiming the throne that was unjustly taken away from his family decades ago. He already possesses the support of the most influential griffons within Katerin, and a highly trained military force, the only thing left to do is to make it official. "
KAT_posture_the_new_army:0 "Posture Over The New Army"
KAT_posture_the_new_army_desc:0 "The army of Katerin remains a rabble of warlords and bandits, often refusing to acknowledge the authority of the government altogether. Eric Grimclaw has demanded that he be allowed to take his knights to each of these warlords, and personally force them to kneel and acknowledge his authority over them. Should they refuse, they are free to challenge him to a duel for their position."
KAT_hectors_blessing:0 "Silberkralle's Blessing"
KAT_hectors_blessing_desc:0 ""
KAT_profit_from_state_industry:0 "Profit From State Industry"
KAT_profit_from_state_industry_desc:0 "Eric Grimclaw and the Argentumdammerug own several production factories and mines within their territory, and thanks to their shrewd investment and the recent uptick in the economy, the profits from these investments have greatly increased. By reinvesting said profits back into Katerin, we could stimulate new industrial growth."
KAT_knight_industry:0 "Idustrial Orders"
KAT_knight_industry_desc:0 "The tightly knit knightly orders have been highly successful at maintaining their cohesion and honor, even when faced with a completely insane overlord. Perhaps if the existing industrial guilds were to be restructured along the same lines as the orders, and incorporated into them, those very same benefits could be transferred to said industries."
KAT_clense_deadlands:0 "Clear The Deadlands"
KAT_clense_deadlands_desc:0 "Thanks to the work of the "volunteers" at the deadland labor camps, some of the regions of Katerin most devastated by years of neglect and misuse have begun to heal. The Knightly orders have officially requested that the camps and their inhabitants be turned over to their control, so that they can aid the workers there in clearing the Deadlands once and for all. "
KAT_hectors_knightly_republic:0 "Republican Sway"
KAT_hectors_knightly_republic_desc:0 "Thanks to the efforts of the Silberkralle, the flames of republicanism have once again consumed Katerin. No longer will the griffons tolerate petty despots or dangerous ideologues, the time of democracy and freedom has come. Let the flag of griffonian republicanism once again fly proudly from every home in Katerin, and prepare to officially declare the Republic of Katerin. "
KAT_eriks_restored_katerin:0 "Restore The Principality"
KAT_eriks_restored_katerin_desc:0 "Eric Grimclaw, the rightful heir to the throne of Katerin, has officially declared himself prince, and preparations for his coronation are already underway. The Grimclaw dynasty has at last reclaimed complete control over their homelands, and the griffons of Katerin are relieved to have a griffon of honor and dignity lead them to the future. "
KAT_holy_support:0 "Church Support"
KAT_holy_support_desc:0 "In exchange for the churches support, we have agreed to do away with the "tax collectors" formerly under our employ. In reality, the support of the church will be far more politically and economically valuable in the long run than a bunch of glorified bandits. The hardest part will be hunting them all down, but with the help of the knights that should be done in short order."
KAT_ktreue_investments:0 "Profit Off Investments"
KAT_ktreue_investments_desc:0 "As Katerin starts to recover from its decade long economic downturn, there are many investment opportunities a crafty griffon could use to bolster the state coffers a bit. The griffons of Katerin need money to start up new enterprises which we will provide, and in exchange, we will receive a portion of the profits that said enterprises generate. Helping Katerin rebuild, and making a pretty penny while doing it."
KAT_replace_vipek:0 "Fix the Commissariat"
KAT_replace_vipek_desc:0 "If we are ever to bring order back to the bandit infested countryside of Katerin, then we just start by fixing our officer core. The petty warlords we employ shall no longer be tolerated. They will either accept a proper military rank and the authority of the government, or be killed by the knights, and be replaced by a more loyal and orderly officer. "
KAT_reform_ktreue:0 "Reform the Katerintreue"
KAT_reform_ktreue_desc:0 "In spite of its many liberalizations, the Katerintreue remains a block of elite authoritarians controlling the country with dictatorial power. But we have seen the fate of past dictators, and what can befall a nation that is cursed with an incompetent head of state with absolute power first hand. If the Katerintreue wants to avoid the mistakes of the past and move forward, then it as well must change with the times. "
KAT_ktreue_propaganda:0 "Propaganda Efforts"
KAT_ktreue_propaganda_desc:0 "Decades of abuse and misrule have almost completely shattered the spirit of the common folk in Katerin, and as a result, many are simply apathetic to the situation of the country. These griffons must be inspired, through propaganda if need be, to return to the fields and the factories, to work for the betterment of the entire nation."
KAT_mercantile_reforms:0 "Mercantile Adaptations"
KAT_mercantile_reforms_desc:0 "Katerin lacks a central bank or any real economic authority beyond local guilds at best. If commerce is to survive, and more importantly, thrive within Katerin, then severe reforms must be undertaken. Currency must be standardized, legal frameworks established, and certain industries must be regulated. "
KAT_deadlands_prison_labor:0 "Deadlands Work Camps"
KAT_deadlands_prison_labor_desc:0 "Due to the policies of the previous government, we have found ourselves possessing a large surplus of criminals that need to be put to use. The Deadlands of Katerin remain mostly uninhabited save for a few desperate farmers, and if any real economic use is to be gained from them, then the land must be molded and shaped back into proper form. There could not be a better use for these wretches."
KAT_ktreue_reforms_did:0 "Fighting The Plague"
KAT_ktreue_reforms_did_desc:0 "Despite the best efforts of the church and the knights, Katerin remains beset by a most tenacious plague, that has seen many thousands die and countless more crippled for life. We must work as a united force, combining all of our knowledge about this malady and how to alleviate it, if we hope to ever escape the specter of death that looms over Katerin."
KAT_invite_prelate_to_regency:0 "Invite the Prelate To Lead"
KAT_invite_prelate_to_regency_desc:0 "Although it is little more than a formality at this point, the time has come to officially declare Prelate Duskfeather the leader of the Katerintreue. With him at the helm, Katerin will reform into a pious and prosperous country, a nation that cares for every griffon within its borders. And one that is prepared to defend the rights of its griffons to the last. "
KAT_duskclaws_new_path:0 "A New Path"
KAT_duskclaws_new_path_desc:0 "With the Church now in full control of Katerin, we can finally take the first step on the long path towards religious socialism, to a society where all are equal, and the guiding light of the church sweeps across the entirety of Katerin."
KAT_let_in_the_knights:0 "Let the Orders In"
KAT_let_in_the_knights_desc:0 "The Knightly orders have proven themselves to be far more capable of ruling Katerin that the Katerintreue ever was, and the time has come to acknowledge that fact.

katerin.1.t:0 "Princess Diellza's New Year Ball."
katerin.1.d:0 "At the end of the year, in the final days of December, Princess Diellza Von Diellza called for a grand ball to be held in Katerinburg. However she was not impressed with the amenities of the Halls that had already existed. In response she had numerous Griffons pulled from across the Principality to tear down the oldest of them and construct a new grand hall. However, with little time to plan and complete the project, the concept had to be based on designs made years ago. While the laborers be worked for every single day with no rest until it was completed, lest the Principality face the wrath of Princess Von Diellza. By the end of it, numerous workers had vanished, been executed, or simply worked to death, but the Princess had her Ball."
katerin.1.a:0 "Don't lose your head on the dancefloor!"

katerin.2.t:0 "Plague in Einfoort!"
katerin.2.d:0 "The decaying settlement of Einfoort lies south of the capital. The city itself seems to be representative of Katerin as a whole, its glory days are long behind it, with years of neglectful rule and exploitation having taken a heavy toll from the once burgeoning settlement. The once proud walls of the keep have been in a state of perpetual disrepair for the last 20 years, doing little to discourage any potential attacker. The city itself has grown far beyond the boundary of the walls, with villagers fleeing from bandits and the plague taking refuge in an ever-expanding network of tents and shanties.  The city is in ruins, all that remains is its decaying cadaver, and the vultures have come to feast.\n\nWith the constant stream of refugees to the city, it was inevitable, the plague has come to Einfoort. If the city, and more importantly its inhabitants are to be saved, then decisive action must be taken.\n\nWhen news of the plague arrived at the capital, the knightly orders of katerin stood ready to secure the city at a moments notice. The orders have served the principality with an upright zeal for centuries, dedicated to upholding a tradition of chivalry that stretches back hundreds of years. Two major orders have established themselves within the Principality, and both have volunteered for the task.\n\nFirstly, there is the venerable order of the Silberkralle, lead by the honorable Grandmaster Hector Ardennson.  The Silberkralle acts as the sword and the shield of the common griffon, striving to make the life of the peasants as comfortable as possible given the circumstances. The Silberkralle desires to calmy and carefully take control of the city, minimizing the danger to the common folk and granting those to sick to survive a merciful and peaceful end.\n\nThe other knightly order of Katerin, the Argentumdämmerung has also volunteered for the task. Lead by the fervent Grandmaster Erik Grimclaw, the foremost objective of the Argentumdämmerung is to pull the plague out by its roots, and reclaiming the deadlands of Katerin for the Empire. What they lack in experience they make up for in zeal, and they seek to drag the plague from the city as quickly as is possible, minimizing the risk of infection for the populace.\n\nOf course, the Orders could always be dismissed and Einfoorts garrison given the task of restoring order, but the garrison was already small and poorly maintained before the plague hit, and there is no telling what methods they might resort to."
katerin.2.a:0 "The Garrison locks down the city."
katerin.2.b:0 "The Silberkralle intervenes."
katerin.2.c:0 "Argentumdammerung scourges the city."

katerin.3.t:0 "Einfoort in Chaos."
katerin.3.d:0 "When the Garrison was given the ultimate responsibility of restoring order within Einfoort, many of its denizens were relieved. Fearing that the zealotry of the Orders would only serve to increase the damage and that entrusting such a task to the garrison of the city would result in the least amount of damage to the city. But none could predict what methods the garrison would resort to, the means by which they would purify the city of the diseased. \n\nThe problems started only a few days after the garrison was given the task, when food shortages combined with a fear of the plague caused a panic amongst the peasants. The garrison found itself overwhelmed, and was ultimately forced to retreat within the crumbling walls of the keep while the riot burnt itself out. This incident was clearly the last straw for the garrison, who perceived their position as untenable. Fearing for their lives and becoming ever more paranoid of the plague, the garrison took the only option that made sense to them.\n\nThey burnt the city to the ground. Gathering the remaining oil and torches contained within the keep, the garrison procededed to methodically walk through the city, setting everything they encountered ablaze, and killing all those who resisted. \n\nThe plague is gone, and Einfoort along with it. All that remains of the city are burnt ruins, and whatever poor wretches who managed to escape the blaze.  "
katerin.3.a:0 "Like a fever burns away a sickness."

katerin.4.t:0 "Einfoort in Chaos."
katerin.4.d:0 "When the orderly columns of the Silberkralle marched into Einfoort, many of its citizens saw them as divine saviors sent by Boreas himself. The Silberkralle is well known for its compassion and sympathty for the lower classes of Katerin, and their arrival gave the desperate populace of the city the glimmer of hope that they had desperately been seeking. The Talon was quick to officially relieve the beleaguered garrison of the city, who were immensely pleased that the city was now someone else's problem.\n\nA curfew was shortly enforced across the city, with the Knights of the Talon restoring order to the streets with efficiency, yet not without compassion. The Knights of the Talon have been understanding but firm, who sook to separate the diseased from the healthy and allow them to live out their final days in peace. The citizens of Einfoort were undoubtedly put at ease due to these efforts, there was a deeper meaning to them.\n\nThe Silberkralle carries with it a secret objective, they seek to establish the exact cause behind the infection, and the mysterious plague that Katerin has suffered for so long. The Knights have questioned every single sick griffon they have found with vigor, trying to find the root of the infection, and the route through which it first managed to arrive within the city.  Time will tell what secrets they uncover. "
katerin.4.a:0 "We must find the root cause."

katerin.5.t:0 "Einfoort in Chaos"
katerin.5.d:0 "The Knights of the Argentumdämmerung entered Einfoort in a somber but disciplined manner. They paid no attention to the unwitting bystanders who thought help had arrived. They knew that their task would be a bloody one, that in order to save the city, the rot that lies at its core must be pulled out, and that there would be no avoiding collateral damage. But they were resigned to their bloody task for if they did not carry it out, then who would? The knights would do whatever needed to be done but they would take no pleasure from it.\n\nThe Grandmaster of the Argentumdämmerung himself, Eric Grimclaw, was leading them. He was not one to shy away from such a challenge, and he would not dream of making his loyal knights carry alone the burden of such a task. The Grimclaws could trace their ancestry all the way back to the founding of Katerin itself, and although they had lost control of the principality, the last scion of the Grimclaws still wielded great influence within his homeland.\n\nThe knights quickly took the reigns off the garrison and moved to secure every quarter of the city. Every single house was to be searched for any trace of the infection, and those of the sick deemed to be beyond saving were granted a merciful end at the hands of the knights. Einfoort would be cleansed, nevermind the cost."
katerin.5.a:0 "Round up anyone suspicious."

katerin.6.t:0 "The Ruins of Einfoort."
katerin.6.d:0 "As the news of Einfoort's ultimate fate spreads around Katerin, panic enveloped the populace. The government had never held the best interests of the lower classes in mind, but the griffons had never imagined that it would perpetrate such a blatant atrocity against its own citizens. The common griffon had already known that the military would do little to protect them against bandits, but now every single garrison was seen as a collection of murderers and madmen. Protests over the bonfire of Einfoort erupted in the major cities of Katerin, and those protests soon erupted into riots, ones that had to be dispersed by force.\n\nThe citizens of Katerin now flook to anyone who promises to save them from the claws of their government, with both of the Knightly Orders have received a large boost in applications to join. But not every griffon can count on the protection of the knights, limited in griffonpower as they are. For these poor wretches, there is nothing to protect them if the nearest garrison were to turn on them. They yearn for something to protect them from the abuses thrust upon them by their government, and grow more radical by the day."
katerin.6.a:0 "Probelm solved, what's for tea?"

katerin.7.t:0 "The Search of Einfoort."
katerin.7.d:0 "While the Silberkralle maintained its iron grip on Einfoort, the curfew was strictly enforced, and knights patrolled the streets at all hours of the day. But as the days passed by, the leadership of the Talon becomes all the more intrigued by the situation in Einfoort. When the Talon first arrived, a special detachment of knights was issued the task of identifying the exact means by which the plague entered the city, hoping to prevent such a fate befalling the other major settlements of Katerin. These knights diligently questioned each and every infected Griffon they encountered, trying to establish a timeline that stretched back to the first infected griffon to enter the settlement. \n\nYet their task, although by no means a simple one, has only grown stranger as they look deeper into the roots of problem. Their informants disappear, griffons who were healthy just a few days before suddenly contract the plague, and it seems that most of the records the garrison kept about the state of the city from the time the infection was first reported seems to have mysteriously disappeared. \n\nAs they dug deeper into the case, their suspicion have only grown. A request for more investigators was soon sent to the headquarters of the Silberkralle, and now a steady stream of scribes and knights flock to Einfoort in an effort to investigate this mystery. There is something rotten in the foundations of Einfoort, perhaps in the whole of Katerin, and the Silberkralle will stop at nothing to find out what it was."
katerin.7.a:0 "Secure the city and start the search!"

katerin.8.t:0 "The Crusade of Einfoort."
katerin.8.d:0 "When the Argentumdämmerung entered Einfoort to cleanse it of the plague, they had hoped that their task would be a short one. That the would be able to root out the infection quickly and cleanly, saving the majority of the population from the ravages of the plague. They were wrong. Despite their best efforts, there seems to be no end to the infected. The Knights try to separate the infected and the healthy entirely, but keeping loved ones from the sick is an almost impossible task, and one that some of the knights do not resilient enough to handle. \n\nWhat was supposed to be a quick and merciful execution turns into a drawn-out battle of attrition against the plague, the sick are disposed of in the most efficient manner possible, but such a task takes a toll on both the body and the mind. Many knights are unable to handle the pressure, and end up leaving the settlement traumatized by their own actions. Others fall victim to the plague, and have to be dispatched by their own comrades. Yet in the face of such immense psychological pressure, Eric Grimclaw remains unflinching in carrying out his duty.\n\nMore knights are called to the settlement, to relive the ones that are unable to continue on with the task. Eric would see to it that the plague would not spread any further than Einfoort, he had taken a personal vow to cleanse the city, and he would not have anything stop him. He wouldn't allow the sacrifice of the ones who had already died within the walls of the city to be in vain. He couldn't live with himself if he did."
katerin.8.a:0 "This den of sin shall be cleansed!"

katerin.9.t:0 "The Prelate's journey."
katerin.9.d:0 "Although Katerin has no real diplomatic presence in wider Griffonia, envoys from the principality are known to occasionally travel to other lands for one purpose or another.  Such an occasion has just arisen, as Prelate Duskfeather has expressed his desire to travel to the County of Longsword, to protest the deplorable treatment of the pony minorities residing within the county. The Prelate hopes to ease the souls of the departed ponies and to lodge an official complaint with the count, expressing his great concern for the effect the count's actions will have on his everlasting soul.\n\nAs the Prelate happens to be traveling to Longsword, the possibility of rekindling some of our old bonds in the region presents itself. Wingfried von Katerinburg leads the Reformistein in the neighboring Knightly Order of Helquill, although given his rather... extreme political views, he might not take such a visit kindly. "
katerin.9.a:0 "Wish him a safe trip."
katerin.9.b:0 "Request he visit cousin Wingfried."

katerin.10.t:0 "A Specter in the night."
katerin.10.d:0 "Count Pallas Dusktalon sat at his desk in his personal quarters late at night, finishing the last of the daily paperwork he was required to do as the count of Longsword. The events of the previous day had done little to improve the count's mood, due to news of increased partisan activity, coupled with a visit from a particularly annoying prelate from Katerin. The very same prelate had continually annoyed him with requests for a private audience, to "See if he could save his eternal soul from damnation". Pallas had eventually given in to the prelates incessant badgering, and he was due to arrive in his quarters any moment. \n\nHe soon heard a knock on the door, and a few seconds later the Prelate Duskfeather stood before him. But as the count would soon discover, the Prelate had a much different topic of discussion in his mind that he expected. The Prelate proceeded to transform into a lich before the counts very eyes, shedding his mortal shell for an eternal body of bone and magic. Pallas was frozen in his seat, whether it was due to some arcane magic, or simply primal fear was unknown to him. \n\nThe lich then made a very simple offer Pallas. The lich wanted only to relive Pallas of the many unicorns that infested his fine county, and would pay generously for any deliveries of unicorns the count would send to Katerin. It seemed like an offer too good to be true, the chance to be rid of some of the inferior beasts within Longsword and to be rewarded for the effort. But dealing with the undead could have unintended consequences, and the lich clearly had sinister plans for the future. "
katerin.10.a:0 "They're yours, now leave at once."
katerin.10.b:0 "I...I...I don't think I should..."

katerin.11.t:0 "The Prelate tours Longsword."
katerin.11.d:0 "Prelate Duskfeather recently returned from his successful visit to the County of Longsword, after the count himself allowed him to tour the county. The Prelate regaled the court with tales of the immense amount of suffering that the ponies within the county are made to endure, and of his noble efforts to relive their suffering in what small manner he could. The Princess cared little for his tales, and he was soon dismissed from her presence, a merciful treatment when compared to the fate that befalls others who dare bore the princess. \n\nAlongside the prelate came a caravan of the faithful, consisting of various pilgrims and priests that the Prelate picked up on his journey, alongside a truly immense amount of cargo. It seems that the Prelate was very busy indeed within Longsword. "
katerin.11.a:0 "May he commend their souls to peace."

katerin.12.t:0 "Longsword spurns us!?"
katerin.12.d:0 "Prelate Duskfeather was forced to return from his tour of Longsword earlier than expected, as the count had his soldiers escort him out of the county for daring to interfere with Longswordian affairs. Although Katerin does not have the best reputation with the wider griffonian states, but such an overt insult to the principality has never been received before. When the Princess was informed of the counts actions she interpreted them as a personal insult, and it took a truly immense amount of effort to convince her not to declare war on Longsword for their actions. \n\nThe Prelate himself seemed crestfallen that he was unable to do what little he could to stop the genocidal actions of Count Pallas, and quickly retired to his personal chambers, no doubt to pray for the souls of the ponies within Longsword. "
katerin.12.a:0 "They will regret this!"

katerin.13.t:0 "An emissary from Katerin."
katerin.13.d:0 "A most unexpected visitor came to the headquarters of the Reformistein today, as Prelate Duskfeather from Katerin arrived for an audience with Wingfried von Katerinburg. The princess of Katerin, Diellza the Insane, who had commanded the Prelate to visit her cousin. After a short introduction it quickly became clear that Diellza had no message to deliver to Wingfried, and had only commanded the prelate to visit Wingfried on a whim. The Prelate was apparently on a journey to Longsword, officially to protest the "horrific treatment" that was being rightfully inflicted on the ponies there. \n\nBut when Wingfried proceeded to explain why said treatment was justified, he found the Prelate to be surprisingly amicable to his ideas. The conversation soon transferred to a far more interesting topic, as the Prelate revealed that he was seeking unicorns to use for some unknown project of his. Wingfried found the Prelate surprisingly agreeable, and certainly the Reformisein would be happy to arrange for the disappearance of a few unfortunate parasites within Hellquill, but the question of what they would receive from the bargain was still unanswered. \n\nIt was then that the Prelate presented his true form to Wingfried, transforming into a powerful lich. The undead creature revealed that it knew about the darker ambitions of the Reformistein, and proceeded to conjure up a sample of a purple concoction, promising that he could aid their research into the creation of an artificial plague with his arcane secrets should they fulfill their end of the bargain. The proposition seemed too good to refuse. "
katerin.13.a:0 "We welcome new ties with the Fatherland."
katerin.13.b:0 "We need nothing from that old corpse!"

katerin.14.t:0 "The Prelate visits Wingfried."
katerin.14.d:0 "Prelate Duskfeather has returned from his journey to Longsword, and reported to the court that his detour to Hellquill was most successful. He was able to get an audience with Wingfried, and had a most fruitful discussion with the griffon. The Princess was delighted to hear that her cousin Wingfried was so happy to receive her envoys, and declared that she would personally invite him to her next party when the time came. \n\nThe Prelate also reported that he was able to secure favors from several religious leaders within Hellquill, and that caravans of the faithful would soon arrive to join him in a religious ceremony. He requested that these pilgrims be allowed to travel through Katerin undisturbed by the "Tax collectors" under the employ of the Principality, and in one of her rare moods of generosity the Princess granted him his request. The Prelate then thanked Diellza for her understanding and generosity, and soon retired to his chambers to arrange for the travel of the caravans. "
katerin.14.a:0 "He is still a son of Katerin."

katerin.15.t:0 "Wingfried does not wish to meet."
katerin.15.d:0 "Prelate Duskfeather returned crestfallen from his visit to Hellquill, as he reported somewhat nervously to Diellza that Wingfried had refused to meet with him. The news of Wingfrieds treatment of her envoys sent the Princess into a rage, and she promptly declared that Wingfried would not be receiving any more invitations to her parties until she received an official apology from him. If anyone in the court was aware that she had not invited her cousin to any of her parties, they were not brave enough to speak up.\n\nThe Prelate was no doubt disappointed by his failure to secure an audience with Wingfried, and the Princess was quick to assign him some of the blame for the actions of Wingfried. He received a harsh dressing down from the Princess, and proceeded to retire to his chambers to pray in private for Wingfrieds soul. "
katerin.15.a:0 "Has he forgotten his birthplace already?"

katerin.16.t:0 "The Alchemist returns to the Princess"
katerin.16.d:0 "Princess Diellza held court every single day to hear the pleas of her subjects, on paper that is. In reality the Princess' court, in the rare few days she decides to show up to it, is a strange and unnerving proceeding. Most of the nobles avoid making anything more than a token appearance at them, as any slight interaction with the Princess has the potential for a lethal result. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to her actions, and asking her to judge on anything was to invite disaster. To take a recent example, a griffon who had lost all of his belongings to bandits was sentenced to prison for not having protected his own property.\n\nOnly the truly desperate approached the mad princess when she presided over court, which made it all the stranger when a griffon fitting none of those descriptors approached her openly. The potion salesman hailed from Yale, and had operated within Katerin for a time many decades ago as the court alchemist for the Princess' father. The aged griffon carried with him a suitcase, and contained within were three vials which he hoped would, at the very least, soothe the princess for a while.\n\nThe alchemist proceeded to present the vials to the princess, and he made it clear to her that only one could be chosen, as mixing potions rarely had good results. Firstly, there was the vial that came from the north. It had the most brilliant aquamarine color the court had ever seen, and even still as the liquid was within the vial, strange patterns seemed to appear within the fluid if one looked at it long enough. \n\nThe next vial came from the west, concocted within the alchemist's laboratory within Yale. The dark green liquid within seemed to move on its own, swirling around within the vial even when no outside force was acting upon it. The vial itself was hot to the touch, and it was clear that the liquid within was far from dormant, although the alchemist assured that it was safe to drink.\n\nLastly, there was the vial that hailed from the south. Unlike the others, the liquid within this vial seemed completely inert. It was completely clear, colorless and lacked any odor to speak of as well. No matter how long the vial was studied by the nobles, it seemed no different than normal drinking water. Perhaps that is what made it the most frightening of all the liquids to some. After all the liquids had been presented, the time had come for the Princess to choose which one she would drink."

katerin.18.t:0 "Dinner with Glitterhoof"
katerin.18.d:0 "Princess Diellza had been working hard the last few days, managing the principality was no easy task after all, and she had decided to take a day off from her duties to enjoy with her paramour Gliterhoof. The dining hall in the palace had been reserved for this occasion, and she had made sure to select only the very best delicacies for Gliterhoof. And with the preparations for the dinner complete, the time had come for her date with Gliterhoof to begin.\n\nThe hall itself was decorated in the most lavish manner possible, with colored banners adorning the walls, and portraits of Diellza's honored ancestors watching over the dining table. The appetizers of tonight's meal already adorned the table, as the palace's cooks had, on Diellza's orders, spared no expense in preparing for tonight's feast. The princess entered the dining hall, clothed in one of her more ostentatious dresses, and took her seat at the end of the table.\n\nAs she took her seat, she spotted Glitterhoof on the opposite end of the table. The skull was freshly polished for the occasion, and even had a rather expensive looking hat on. The princess started eating her meal and quickly decided to strike up a conversation with her date. "So how are you enjoying the feast Gliterhoof, I trust that everything is to your satisfaction?"\n\nThe Skull wasn't very talkative.\n\nThe lack of a reply from Gliterhoof did little to deter the Princess, who cheerfully continued to speak. "Oh my, I can see that you haven't even touched your portion of the meal, Don't worry dear, I'll make sure that the cooks are suitably punished for serving food that is so antithetical to your tastes."\n\nThe rest of the date went in much the same way, with the Princess having a seemingly infinite capacity to talk to the skull. The palace guard could do little but watch, and quietly inform the cooks that they best make themselves disappear before the meal is over."

katerin.44.t:0 "The Foal"
katerin.44.d:0 "Hector Ardensson, the current Grandmaster of the silver talon, was perhaps one of the most experienced griffons in the entire principality. A lifetime of training and struggle had honed his skills in strategy to a fine edge, and the griffon himself was no stranger to the battlefield, having received the majority of his experience during the fierce fighting against the Republicans during their mass uprising. \n\nBut his disposition had soured with age, and having to suffer through one incompetent noble council after another did little to improve it. Over time, his youthful enthusiasm was replaced by a stone mask of composed detachment. \n\nIt was the very same mask that mask would be shattered on a routine patrol to Eifoort. His party was surveying the outskirts when they noticed it, a few disturbed sections of farmland being the only obvious signs that anything was amiss. Hector went by himself to investigate the site, and when he returned it was clear that something had shocked him to the core.\n\nThe field had contained the corpse of a foal, one that had been alive only a few hours earlier. The Grandmaster could hardly believe what he saw, and stood silently at the site for hours after sending his party to secure the surrounding area, and to fetch the Grandmaster of the other knightly order still remaining in the principality.\n\nGrandmaster Eric soon arrived, and his initial reaction was one of shock and terror. "Gods, I've seen the dead before, but never this young, do we have any leads, are there any traces of what might have done this?"\n\nHector already knew that field was empty save for the corpse and the two griffons observing it, and the wind howling through the grass around them. "Beyond the fact that it was a Unicorn, we have little to no evidence to go on, its as if the poor thing was dumped here by magic, so our investigation will most likely start there" Hector wanted nothing more than to give the poor thing a proper burial, but he knew that would have to wait until a thorough analysis of the wounds was completed.\n\nHector gazed at the body one last time, before heading off to rejoin his party to start the investigation properly. He left Eric at the scene to guard it until a proper perimeter could be established, and as Eric watched Hector disappear into the distance, he could hear him muttering to himself. "
