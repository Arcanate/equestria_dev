### National Focuses ###

KAT_a_new_year:0 "A New Year"
KAT_a_new_year_desc:0 "With the New Year's Ball out of the way Princess Diellza Von Katerin is ready to assume her full duties as Princess once again. She has been pressuring those around her for more power and more influence in her own Government. What worries most is that this will end with her just making everything worse, but only time will tell."
KAT_good_to_be_princess:0 "Good to be Princess"
KAT_good_to_be_princess_desc:0 "The princess wields almost total power within the principally, why should she not use this power to enjoy herself a bit. It is only natural that her massive efforts for the good of the principality be rewarded in some way, even if it adds a few coins to the principalities debt."
KAT_the_funny_potions_man:0 "The Funny Potion Seller"
KAT_the_funny_potions_man_desc:0 "In what appears to be an attempt to purchase medicine, the princess has summoned a doctor to the capital for an official visit. The court is full of rumors as to the identity of this supposed doctor, and a small glimmer of hope that they might be able to "fix" the princess has emerged."
KAT_all_my_friends:0 "Write Out Letters"
KAT_all_my_friends_desc:0 "A party with no guests is no real party at all, and the princess wants to ensure that as many of her friends are present as is physically possible. The invitations thus need to be sent out as soon as possible... once she actually gets around to writing them that is."
KAT_a_date_with_glitterhoof:0 "Spend the Day With Glitterhoof"
KAT_the_next_party:0 "The Next Party"
KAT_the_next_party_desc:0 "Only moments after the new year's ball concluded, Princess Diellza ordered that preparations for the next grand ball would start immediately. To start with, a large amount of the treasury must be set aside for the party budget, and the construction of the venue must start immediately, no matter how much the workers might complain about it."
KAT_a_princess_s_banquet:0 "Prepare for the Princess's Banquet"
KAT_a_princess_s_banquet_desc:0 "The princess has decreed that the grand ball will have nothing less than the very finest cuisine in the entirety of Griffonia in its banquet. Anything less would be a grievous insult to both the guests and, much worse, the princess. Thus preparations for it must start immediately!"
KAT_sample_the_fineries:0 "Sample the Fineries"
KAT_sample_the_fineries_desc:0 "We shall hold a tasting of some of the food we have procured for the feast, an appatizer for the party to come."
KAT_shop_for_diningware:0 "Shop For New Diningware"
KAT_shop_for_diningware_desc:0 "The perfect meal is nothing if it is served on trash! The Princess shall see to it herself that the dinner is served on only the best diningware she can find, and money is not an issue."
KAT_prepare_the_finest_meal:0 "The Finest Meal"
KAT_prepare_the_finest_meal_desc:0 "As the finest chefs in the continent have no been gathered, the time has come to prepare the main course for the banquet. This will no doubt require many attempts before the perfect result is achieved, and the princess has thus requisitioned the majority of the food in the country for use during the creation of the main course, anything less would not do."
KAT_a_day_in_the_library:0 "A Day in the Library"
KAT_a_day_in_the_library_desc:0 "Princess Diellza never had the best grasp of the literary arts. In fact, there have even been some doubts that she knows how to read at all. But the Princess will not let such a small issue prevent her from visiting the principalities royal library to investigate it."
KAT_river_boatride:0 "A River Boatride"
KAT_river_boatride_desc:0 "As the princess grows ever more bored with what little management of Katerin she still performs, she has decided to take yet another break. This time the princess has scurried off to a casino located on a steamship. The fact that she absconded with the majority of the treasury gives the court little reason to expect good results."
KAT_private_magic_show:0 "Private Magic Show"
KAT_private_magic_show_desc:0 "In another one of her fits of boredom, Princess Dizella has yet again seen fit to spend a very sizable amount of money on entertainment for the day. This time she has hired a traveling troupe of unicorns to provide entertainment for an entire day. The court waits with bated breath to see what disaster will come out of this arrangement."
KAT_party_planning:0 "Party Planning Committee"
KAT_party_planning_desc:0 "Planning parties is a most arduous task, and the time of the princess is limited. In order to complete the preparations for the next party as soon as possible, she has decided to delegate several aspects of the party to a hand-picked committee, and naturally, she has allowed them full access to the Principalities treasury for any use they see fit."
KAT_make_reservations:0 "Reserve Entertainment"
KAT_make_reservations_desc:0 ""
KAT_take_meds:0 "Force Down the Potion"
KAT_take_meds_desc:0 "The Katerintreue in a perhaps doomed attempt to relive some of the mental "eccentricities" of the princess, has resolved to make her drink the potion she got from the doctor. Some of them hope that this will at least calm her down, others don't want such an expensive potion to go to waste, and some just want to see what will happen."
KAT_the_grand_ball:0 "The Grand Ball"
KAT_the_grand_ball_desc:0 "The date that the princess has been eagerly anticipating, and the court has been dreading, approaches with frightening speed. With all the preparations complete, the grand ball is just a scant few days away. Whatever happens during the ball, it is sure to be a night to remember."

KAT_do_own_work:0 "Diellza in Control"
KAT_do_own_work_desc:0 "With matters finally resolved, the time has come to cement Diellzas authority within the principality. The princess herself has little interest in the minute of such a task, and has thus decided delegated large portions of the matter to the Katerintreue. Time will tell if such a decision proves wise."
KAT_assign_yesmen:0 "Expand The Katerintreue"
KAT_assign_yesmen_desc:0 "The Katerintreue as it stands is too small to effectively manage the entire principality, and it must thus be expanded. There is no shortage of ambitious griffons looking for a spot in the Katerintreue, and quite a few favors can be earned in exchange for a favorable assignment within it."
KAT_infiltrate_the_orders:0 "Infiltrate the Orders"
KAT_infiltrate_the_orders_desc:0 "The knightly orders of Katerin have never been very comfortable with the reign of the princess and the Katerintreue. Many within the government fear that they may be plotting to overthrow them. To ensure that such an attempt would be discovered before it can be carried out, several agents of the Katerintreue started to infiltrate the orders, hoping to subvert their power by any means nessicary."
KAT_peasant_yesmen:0 "Peasants in the Katerintreue"
KAT_peasant_yesmen_desc:0 "While the Katerintreue may have started out as a noble council, advising the princess on the day to day management of the principality, the growing influence of the organization has made membership a coveted prize within Katerin. Allowing some of the more influential peasants to have a seat on the table will earn us a few valuable favors, and will surely calm the rabble a bit as well."
KAT_pocketed_yeogriffs:0 "Katerintreue Yeogriffs"
KAT_pocketed_yeogriffs_desc:0 "As the infiltration of the knightly orders continues to its next phase, several of our agents have found themselves in lite to be promoted to the position of Yeogriff. If promoted they would be in a much better position to report in on the activities of the guild. Needless to say, supporting these agents should be a priority in the coming weeks."
KAT_armed_taxmen:0 "Armed Tax Collectors"
KAT_armed_taxmen_desc:0 "The griffons of Katerin are, to put it bluntly, destitute. Extracting tax revenues from them is akin to drawing blood from a stone. The solution to this issue is, of course, to smash the stone with a hammer.  From this point onwards, the royal tax collectors of Katerin will carry arms wherever they go, in order to "incentivize" the proper payment of taxes by the populace."
KAT_legalize_banditry:0 "Legalize Banditry"
KAT_legalize_banditry_desc:0 "Katerin barely possesses enough conscripts to keep the main cities and towns safe, and scouring the bandits from the countryside would be an impossible task for our meager forces to accomplish. But recently an... unorthodox solution to the problem of banditry has been presented to the Katerintreue by the Princess, what if banditry were legal?"
KAT_enforcers_of_her_will:0 "Katerintreue Enforcers"
KAT_enforcers_of_her_will_desc:0 "With the bandits now loyal to Katerin, the task of taking full control of the countryside has become possible. But a problem lies with the serfs living in said countryside, they are rather reluctant to serve a government that has done little to help them. Such disobedience cannot be tolerated, and the enforcers of the Katerintreue will make it clear that they have little choice in the matter."
KAT_define_territory:0 "Define Territory"
KAT_define_territory_desc:0 "The newly created enforcers have proven most enthusiastic in carrying out their work, perhaps a bit too enthusiastic. While they do serve the purpose of cowing the serfs excellently, whenever two enforcers meet the result is often far from pretty. The enforcers tend to clash on the ownership of “tax revenues”, and unless the territory of each enforcer is strictly defined, things will continue to get worse."
KAT_enforce_corvee:0 "Remind the Citizens of Their Duty"
KAT_enforce_corvee_desc:0 "As the enforcers of the Katerintreue now patrol the countryside, and the serfs have been reminded of the price of disobedience, the time has come to put them to work. Katerin is in shambles, and reconstructing it is a daunting task. If we are ever to turn the deadlands into profitable parcels of territory, then the serfs must be worked to the bone."
KAT_kat_march_railroad:0 "Katerinburg Railroad"
KAT_kat_march_railroad_desc:0 "Katerinburg, while being the capital of the principality, is a far cry from a modern city. The city itself is plagued with poverty and crime, and a proper railroad connecting it to the rest of the country was never realized, due to the dangers of the surrounding swamp. This state of affairs cannot be tolerated any longer, and the Katerintreue has ordered that rails be laid no matter how many serf lives it takes."
KAT_link_einfoort:0 "Link Lingermill"
KAT_link_einfoort_desc:0 "As the capital now possesses a functioning rail lines, the prospect of linking Lingermill with the capital is now possible. A direct connection between Katerinburg and Andorstadt would cut down on many weeks of travel through treacherous countryside. Some may consider the working conditions needed to establish said rail connection to be dangerous, but such ideas are of no concern to Diellza."
KAT_furstentumwerke_katalina:0 "Fürstentumwerke Diellza"
KAT_furstentumwerke_katalina_desc:0 "Katerin is, to put it bluntly, an industrial backwater. The sheer chaos of the last few years drow away any foreign investment, and any griffon who possessed enough money to fun a factory would much rather spend said money on fleeing from Katerin than investing in it. But with the recent increase in tax revenues, the possibility of the government funding a few factories of its own has been brought up."
KAT_mines_of_andorstadt:0 "Mines of Andorstadt"
KAT_mines_of_andorstadt_desc:0 "Andorstadt is the largest city within Lingermill, and was once the seat of very profitable mines that supported the city's economy. Sadly, the chaos that engulfed the principality, coupled with labor shortages forced the mines to permanently close. But with the Katerintreue now establishing order, a plan using a few prisoners and serfs to reopen them under the authority of the Katerintreue has started."
KAT_trades_education:0 "Trades Education"
KAT_trades_education_desc:0 "The Katerintreue has finally managed to wretch enough control away from the princess to make a proper, if limited, system of education. Rather than the system that Diellza started, that is forcing griffons into a library to read books at random, an education system based around teaching young griffons valuable trades shall be adopted. This is by far the most popular action the Katerintreue has ever taken."
KAT_stahlfabrik_katerinburg:0 "Stahlfabrik Katerinburg"
KAT_stahlfabrik_katerinburg_desc:0 "The mines of Andorstadt now supply the capital with a steady source of iron, and the abundance of the material supplied by the mines has given the industrialists of the Katerintreue an idea. A steel works within the capital would be the most advanced building in the entire principality, and a drain on the treasury. But the long term advantages provided by such a building far outweigh the initial cost of constructing it."
KAT_steam_pump_land_reclaimation:0 "Mechanical Land Reclaimation"
KAT_steam_pump_land_reclaimation_desc:0 "Thanks to the large increases in “tax” revenue the Katerintreue have brought to the principality, the purchase of several trucks, tractors and steam pumps to clear out more swamplands around the capital has begun. These machines will not only serve the purpose of expanding the amount of arable land around the capital, but for a larger push of industrialization across the country too. "
KAT_bribe_those_with_power:0 "Bribe Those in Power"
KAT_bribe_those_with_power_desc:0 "While the Katerintreue holds much sway over the laws of Katerin, it does not yet wield absolute power within the principality. The occasional noble lord still complains about the situation within the principality, with some even daring to write letters to the capital demanding action. With the new tax revenue, we can fix this."
KAT_loyal_gang_bosses:0 "Loyal Gang Bosses"
KAT_loyal_gang_bosses_desc:0 "While normally trusting the leader of a group of bandits is an unwise proposition, this situation in Katerin is far from normal. In particular, several of the gang bosses we have dealt with in the past have proven to be very agreeable to working for the government, especially when certain “incentives” are presented."
KAT_serfs_clear_marshes:0 "Use Serfs to Clear the Marshland"
KAT_serfs_clear_marshes_desc:0 "In order to salvage this disaster of a principality, sacrifices will have to be made. The vast marshlands in Katerin could be put to good use if only the dangerous task of clearing them were accomplished, and compared to the economic advantages such an endeavor would bring, the lives of a few serfs are a pittance."
KAT_increase_peonage_conscripts:0 "Increase Peonage Conscripts"
KAT_increase_peonage_conscripts_desc:0 "The current armed forces under the direct control of the Katerintreue are, to put it bluntly, pathetic. If we are to reclaim control of the countryside then our forces must be drastically expanded, and while former prisoners might not make for the best of soldiers, they do fill out the ranks quite nicely."
KAT_ganger_armies:0 "Punish Disloyalty"
KAT_ganger_armies_desc:0 "Although we have been tolerant of the excesses that our bandit allies are prone to take, the time has come to make it clear that their loyalty and competence is the only thing keeping them alive. Any bandit too ineffective or disloyal will be removed from the principality, permanently."
KAT_rough_diamonds:0 "Rough Diamonds"
KAT_rough_diamonds_desc:0 "The minor nobility of Katerin have spent years fighting and ruling in the countryside, and many of them possess a wealth of experience that utterly dwarfs the average peasant conscript. With enough training and a sense of discipline, perhaps these lordlings could be turned into something more effective."
KAT_investigate_knights:0 "Investigate the Knights"
KAT_investigate_knights_desc:0 "Thanks to the efforts of our agents within the knightly orders, we have gathered enough “evidence” of their “crimes” to start a public inquiry on their transgressions against Katerin and its citizens. As long as the trial goes well, the last opponents of the Katerintreue will be permanently crippled."
KAT_punish_disloyalty:0 "Ganger Armies"
KAT_punish_disloyalty_desc:0 "Even though they do have their peculiarities, it cannot be denied that the gangs now loyal to us are superior to the old peasant militias in nearly every aspect. The ganger units have proven so effective that the idea of phasing out the militias entirely and replacing them with gangs at a permanent basis might not be a bad one."
KAT_warlords_of_katerin:0 "The Warlords of Katerin"
KAT_warlords_of_katerin_desc:0 "As the final militias are replaced by their bandit counterparts, ceirtan quirks within our ranks have made themselves clear. Although they may be battle hardened, rival gangs are more likely to fight each other than the enemy, and their leaders expect more autonomy than the old officers. Katerin has thus been divided between these warlords, with each gang leader effectively a vassal of the Katerintreue."
KAT_clean_the_ranks:0 "Clean the Ranks"
KAT_clean_the_ranks_desc:0 "As the bandits of Katerin are trained into a fully effective military force, it has become clear that their ranks are bloated with the lazy and the incompetent. These griffons have outlived their usefulness, and their former comrades are all too eager to clear out this rot in their ranks."
KAT_clean_house:0 "Clean House"
KAT_clean_house_desc:0 "With the best of the bandits now firmly loyal to the Katerintreue, we finally have the force of arms to remove our remaining enemies from the principality. The few surviving disloyal bandits, the nobles not already within the Katerintreue and any members of the court a bit too loyal to the princess, all will be dealt with in a permanent fashion."
KAT_block_resources_out_east:0 "Embargo the East"
KAT_block_resources_out_east_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, the knights continue to be the lone obstacle standing in between the Katerintreue and complete dominance of Katerin. Inciting them to outright rebellion might be the only way to get rid of them at this point, and blocking any shipments to their lands certainly seems like a good place to start."
KAT_a_test:0 "Test the Knights"
KAT_a_test_desc:0 "Although the Princess is rapidly outliving her welcome, her eccentricities do have their uses. Perhaps we should listen to her order for the knights to do something so utterly insane that they will be forced to refuse. Which will prove to be the catalyst we are looking for. "
KAT_depose_katalina:0 "Depose Diellza"
KAT_depose_katalina_desc:0 "The time has come. Every single griffon with influence wants Princess Diellza gone, and the mad princess so deluded she thinks that she still controls the principality has far outlived her usefulness. No matter the differences we have, there is no griffon in Katerin will argue against this act."
KAT_a_new_dawn:0 "New Dawn Over Katerin"
KAT_a_new_dawn_desc:0 "With the mad princess finally out of the way and with tentative aid of the prelate and the knights, the Katerintreue now rules unchallenged within Katerin. A new dawn rises upon the deadlands, and it is one heralded by the Katerintreue, ready to reap the rewards of their long labour."
KAT_the_spanner:0 "Welcome Industrialists Into The Council"

KAT_deal_with_corpses:0 "Dealing with the Corpses"
KAT_deal_with_corpses_desc:0 "With the garrison now in full control of the city of Einfoort. They must deal with the plague ridden corpses left behind by this particularly nasty wave of prestilence. How they handle the task is still up in the air..."
KAT_close_the_gates:0 "Close the Gates"
KAT_close_the_gates_desc:0 "This city is plagued, that much is clear. Now we have to keep it contained. The city of Einfoort shall be on lockdown until further notice. May Boreas have mercy on all those left inside."
KAT_burn_everything:0 "Burn Everything"
KAT_burn_everything_desc:0 "The city is truly in rough shape. Even now there are still hundreds if not thousands of plague ridden Griffons, clothing, food, even water stores. Nothing can be spared, if we are to overcome this it must all burn."

katerin.1.d:0 "At the end of the year, in the final days of December, Princess Diellza Von Diellza called for a grand ball to be held in Katerinburg. However she was not impressed with the amenities of the Halls that had already existed. In response she had numerous Griffons pulled from across the Principality to tear down the oldest of them and construct a new grand hall. However, with little time to plan and complete the project, the concept had to be based on designs made years ago. While the laborers be worked for every single day with no rest until it was completed, lest the Principality face the wrath of Princess Von Diellza. By the end of it, numerous workers had vanished, been executed, or simply worked to death, but the Princess had her Ball."

katerin.18.d:0 "Princess Diellza had been working hard the last few days, managing the principality was no easy task after all, and she had decided to take a day off from her duties to enjoy with her paramour Gliterhoof. The dining hall in the palace had been reserved for this occasion, and she had made sure to select only the very best delicacies for Gliterhoof. And with the preparations for the dinner complete, the time had come for her date with Gliterhoof to begin.\n\nThe hall itself was decorated in the most lavish manner possible, with colored banners adorning the walls, and portraits of Diellza's honored ancestors watching over the dining table. The appetizers of tonight's meal already adorned the table, as the palace's cooks had, on Diellza's orders, spared no expense in preparing for tonight's feast. The princess entered the dining hall, clothed in one of her more ostentatious dresses, and took her seat at the end of the table.\n\nAs she took her seat, she spotted Glitterhoof on the opposite end of the table. The skull was freshly polished for the occasion, and even had a rather expensive looking hat on. The princess started eating her meal and quickly decided to strike up a conversation with her date. "So how are you enjoying the feast Gliterhoof, I trust that everything is to your satisfaction?"\n\nThe Skull wasn't very talkative.\n\nThe lack of a reply from Gliterhoof did little to deter the Princess, who cheerfully continued to speak. "Oh my, I can see that you haven't even touched your portion of the meal, Don't worry dear, I'll make sure that the cooks are suitably punished for serving food that is so antithetical to your tastes."\n\nThe rest of the date went in much the same way, with the Princess having a seemingly infinite capacity to talk to the skull. The palace guard could do little but watch, and quietly inform the cooks that they best make themselves disappear before the meal is over."

katerin.44.t:0 "The Foal"
katerin.44.d:0 "Hector Ardensson, the current Grandmaster of the silver talon, was perhaps one of the most experienced griffons in the entire principality. A lifetime of training and struggle had honed his skills in strategy to a fine edge, and the griffon himself was no stranger to the battlefield, having received the majority of his experience during the fierce fighting against the Republicans during their mass uprising. \n\nBut his disposition had soured with age, and having to suffer through one incompetent noble council after another did little to improve it. Over time, his youthful enthusiasm was replaced by a stone mask of composed detachment. \n\nIt was the very same mask that mask would be shattered on a routine patrol to Eifoort. His party was surveying the outskirts when they noticed it, a few disturbed sections of farmland being the only obvious signs that anything was amiss. Hector went by himself to investigate the site, and when he returned it was clear that something had shocked him to the core.\n\nThe field had contained the corpse of a foal, one that had been alive only a few hours earlier. The Grandmaster could hardly believe what he saw, and stood silently at the site for hours after sending his party to secure the surrounding area, and to fetch the Grandmaster of the other knightly order still remaining in the principality.\n\nGrandmaster Eric soon arrived, and his initial reaction was one of shock and terror. "Gods, I've seen the dead before, but never this young, do we have any leads, are there any traces of what might have done this?"\n\nHector already knew that field was empty save for the corpse and the two griffons observing it, and the wind howling through the grass around them. "Beyond the fact that it was a Unicorn, we have little to no evidence to go on, its as if the poor thing was dumped here by magic, so our investigation will most likely start there" Hector wanted nothing more than to give the poor thing a proper burial, but he knew that would have to wait until a thorough analysis of the wounds was completed.\n\nHector gazed at the body one last time, before heading off to rejoin his party to start the investigation properly. He left Eric at the scene to guard it until a proper perimeter could be established, and as Eric watched Hector disappear into the distance, he could hear him muttering to himself. "
