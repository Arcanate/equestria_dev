### BRODFELD EVENTS ####

prywhen.2.t:0 "Request Help?"
prywhen.2.d:0 "The filthy communists have the upper claw over us and we need to resort to extreme measures. None of the neighbouring nations wish to participate in this war on our side, but in this desperate hour we shall send a deal to the Outlaws of Blackrock and promise them a share in the spoils of war. Money is the only thing those brutes desire, after all."
prywhen.2.a:0 "Do it."
prywhen.2.b:0 "We cannot trust those savages!"
## EVENT FOR BANDITS ###
prywhen.3.t:0 "Help Brodfeld?"
prywhen.3.d:0 "The Kingdom of Brodfeld is losing ground to the Griffon Liberation Army at an alarming rate. We have received a communique from Brodfeld officially requesting our help in their war effort. While supporting Brodfeld is not necessarily in our best interest, stopping the spread of communism certainly is."
prywhen.3.a:0 "Time to put the Reds in their place!"
prywhen.3.b:0 "Why should we care about their problems?"

prywhen.4.t:0 "The Bandits refuse to help"
prywhen.4.d:0 "The Blackrock Bandits have responded to our request for help. Sadly, they do not see the urgency of the situation and refuse to help us in our struggle against the communists."
prywhen.4.a:0 "Bah, we don't need their help anyways!"
prywhen.4.b:0 "No."

brodfeld.1.t:0 "Foreign Military Aid!"
brodfeld.1.d:0 "We need that! Send the request!"
brodfeld.1.a:0 "Yes!"
brodfeld.2.t:0 "Brodfeld Requests Military Aid!"
brodfeld.2.d:0 "They are in the state of civil war against peasant rebels that have the idea of overthrowing the old rightful regime. It is possible that if the revolution succeeds, it will spread like cancer to us as well. Should we assist the King?"
brodfeld.2.a:0 "Yes! Send support!"
brodfeld.2.b:0 "It's their problem."
brodfeld.3.t:0 "Foreign Military Advisors Arrived!"
brodfeld.3.t_not_arrived:0 "No one sent help!"
brodfeld.3.d:0 "Foreign advisors and volunteers have arrived to support and fight for our cause in the war!"
brodfeld.3.d_not_arrived:0 "Out of all our neighbours, nobody provided any help to us!"
brodfeld.3.a:0 "Great!"
brodfeld.3.b:0 "Curse you all!"

brodfeld.4.t:0 "Brodfeld Requests Military Aid!"
brodfeld.4.d:0 "They are in the state of civil war against peasant rebels that have the idea of overthrowing the old rightful regime. It is possible that if the revolution succeeds, it will spread like cancer to us as well. Should we assist the King?."
brodfeld.4.a:0 "Yes! Send support!"
brodfeld.4.b:0 "It's their problem."
brodfeld.5.t:0 "Brodfeld Requests Industrial Help"
brodfeld.5.d:0 "The Kingdom of Brodfeld is fighting a bloody civil war against communist peasant rebels. The leaders of the Kingdom beg us to help the suffering economy of the country."
brodfeld.5.a:0 "Of course."
brodfeld.5.b:0 "Again, it's their problem."
brodfeld.7.t:0 "Marsh Brigade"
brodfeld.7.d:0 "Come out, warriors of the Marsh!"
brodfeld.7.a:0 "Hurraaah!"

brodfeld.13.t:0 "Tank Quest!"
brodfeld.13.d:0 "There are rumours that the Skyfall Trade Federation purchased several armoured mechanical beasts from ponyland over the ocean. Those machines spit fire and can drive on their own. Their government recently constructed a military factory and started manufacturing the magical creations in secret, away from the public eye. Luckily, one of the federal officials spilled the beans to our prince's mother-in-law, who is a daughter of burgmeister of Fezera and was visiting Skyfall. We should embark a party for the journey and sail west to acquire on of the few models. This might as well be the key to our victory in the civil war. The speed of the operation and reliance of the pirate ship crew that we managed to hire, as they were the only ones to sail these waters, will depend on the amount of pay."
brodfeld.13.a:0 "Let them feel like kings!"
brodfeld.13.b:0 "Buy them rum!"
brodfeld.13.c:0 "We can't give them much."
brodfeld.13.e:0 "For our ancestors' sake, we can't waste time on nonsense!"

brodfeld.14.t:0 "The Tank has Arrived!"
brodfeld.14.d:0 "The journey ended and the pirates kept their word, they didn't run away with the money. What's more important, they brought back a present for us! We shall organise a new division and push the beast to battle! Let it lead us to victory!"
brodfeld.14.a:0 "Hurray!"

#Not s
brodfeld.15.t:0 "The Civil War is Over!"
brodfeld.15.d:0 "Since the last communist forces have capitulated, we are ready to begin our rehabilitation."
brodfeld.15.a:0 "Great."

brodfeld.21.t:0 "The Civil War is Over!"
brodfeld.21.d:0 "After a long struggle, the civil war has at last come to an end. Yet the suffering continues, for our once fair and beautiful country lies in ruin. Food prices are sky-high, trade has come to a halt and the infrastructure is badly damaged. Now we must rebuild and recover, as well as punish the scum responsible for the devastation."
brodfeld.21.a:0 "Brodfeld shall prevail!"

brodfeld.22.t:0 "Peasants of Prywhen!"
brodfeld.22.d:0 "Hear my plea! I call to you to defend your homeland from the traitors that have been ravaging this land for years! These brutes wish to take away your precious farmland and give it to vile robbers and peddlers, all in the name of equality. They seek to undo the natural order of the world, for in their eyes all are equal. They say you, hard-working and proud peasants of Prywhen, are as lowly as your ignorant young sons, cruel bandits in the woods and lazy beggars in the towns. Do you wish to live in such a society? Or will you stand with me against this insanity? You, my dear subjects, shall be enlisted in the royal army of Brodfeld! Today!"
brodfeld.22.a:0 "Conscript as many as possible."
brodfeld.22.b:0 "Don't conscript too many."

brodfeld.23.t:0 "Peasants of Kivessin!"

Now, you have a chance to defend your land, defend your kin, the king and his kin, who are sweating it right out to care about you! The red bandits are coming closer to these places. They are going to slaughter you, burn your villages and steal your lands. Do not let them do this! To arms!"

brodfeld.24.t:0 "Peasants of Sydia!"
brodfeld.24.d:0 "Hear my plea! The fish that you bring us enriched the tables of the people of Prywhen for many years! The crops that you cultivate under the warm southern sun brought cheer and happiness to every loyal subject of the king. Beware now, as the red bandits are approaching this land, there will be no joy anymore. Their claws will take away your land, your food, your shelters. Join the royal army now!"
