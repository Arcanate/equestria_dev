#CIVIL WAR RECONSTRUCTION
BRF_reopen_ports:0 "Reopen The Port of Sydia"
BRF_reopen_ports_desc:0 "The old capital of the Principality of Sydia has always been the largest and busiest port in Prywhen. The war, however, made foreign traders abandon it and forced us to conscript many of the local fishergriffs. Now that peace and order have been restored, merchants and fishers can get back to business! We will repair the port, lower trade tariffs and ease taxation on fish markets, thus helping our economy recover."
BRF_qwoptia_wood:0 "Lifov Forestry"
BRF_qwoptia_wood_desc:0 "Out of all the myriad materials needed for the reconstruction effort, wood stands above all else. By investing in sawmills and nationalizing the forestry companies of Lifow and Qwoptia we can begin mass production of cheap yet versatile lumber. And after the reconstruction is over, we will have a strong forest industry ready to make profit!"
BRF_nasom_dam:0 "White Flower's N.A.S.O.M Dam"
BRF_nasom_dam_desc:0 "Mason of Sydia has approached us with intriguing plans for a project he called N.A.S.O.M.(National Action to Secure Our Modernization): The construction of a hydroelectric dam on the Pry river which will be able to produce many megawatts of energy. While it may be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to build, Mason says he will take care of everything as long as we provide workers."
# If we draft some of our unemployed and idle subjects, this will not be a problem. We will, of course, provide our loyal labourers a lifelihood by paying a decent salary, thus helping them get back on their paws.\n\nA new, modern dam will be a sign of a new age in Prywhen and will help us with the electrification of our Kingdom."
BRF_rice_fields:0 "Our Immense, Boundless Rice Fields" 
#Our HUGE tracts of land
BRF_rice_fields_desc:0 "Decades ago, Brodfeld was known the ricebasket of Griffonia. Sadly, poor weather ruined everything and eventually caused the Great Famine of 995 ALB (Communist claims about the famine being caused by nobles exporting all the food is pure propaganda). Now it is time to restore that title! We shall redistribute the land confiscated from the red scum and subsidize our landowners and peasants."
BRF_prosperity:0"Live in Prosperity"
BRF_prosperity_desc:0"With foreign merchant ships arriving in Sydia, fishers catching fish in the Bay of Salt, our unemployed conscripted to work on the White Flower dam and houses being rebuilt with lumber from Lifov, we are quickly beginning to recover. Much work remains to be done, but the seeds have been planted, and from them golden flowers shall sprout and eventually bloom."
BRF_river_ferry:0"Evi River Ferry"
BRF_river_ferry_desc:0"Communist pig dog sabotage might've ruined most of our regular roads, but the watery highways of nature are invincible: Rivers! While our corvée labourers repair the road network, we will invest in ferries and river patrols. This should ensure regular and safe traffic along the great and holy Evi River."
BRF_new_schools:0 "New Schools Across the Nation"
BRF_new_schools_desc:0 "Prelate Denali and the clergy is grateful to us for saving them from godless communists who wished to eradicate religion and create a secular state. Therefore they are more than willing to cooperate with us in the education of our populace. We shall establish church schools, where our ignorant subjects are taught to read, count and respect Gods and Kings!"
BRF_develop_oil:0 "Repair Our Oil Wells"
BRF_develop_oil_desc:0 "The Terrible Marsh is a cursed land, inhabited mostly by tribal griffons and magical monsters. But it is far from worthless, as beneath the marshes lie vast oil deposits. The wells were badly damaged during the war, but with funds from our recovering economy, we can invest in repairing them."
BRF_sydacute_highway:0 "Sydia - Temsoar Highway"
BRF_sydacute_highway_desc:0 "Our progress in repairing damaged roads has gone well. So well, in fact, that we could start building new ones! The King has plans for a wide, paved road from Sydia to the isolated mining town of Temsoar. We will have to cut our way through the thick Acute Forest, but there's nothing our stout corvée labourers can't overcome."
BRF_kivsydia_railway:0 "Kivessin - Sydia Railway"
BRF_kivsydia_railway_desc:0 "Another infrastructure project in our blessed King's mind is the Kivessin-Sydia railway, first of its kind in Prywhen. While the Evi river already provides an excellent route of transportation, there is no doubt that modern trains are much faster than ferries and have higher capacity. This shall be a sign of a new, modern age in Prywhen!"
BRF_rice_cooking:0 "\"100 Ways to Cook Rice\""
BRF_rice_cooking_desc:0 "Royal printing presses in Sydia, Larios and Kivessin have been tasked with printing hundreds of thousands of copies of a new book, written by the finest culinary minds in Prywhen. It will explain in detail how to prepare various meals out of rice and ensure that it is healthy and filling to eat. The guide will contain illustrations and simple writing that our farmers can read with ease."
BRF_hire_miners:0 "Hire Workers for Temsoar Mines"
BRF_hire_miners_desc:0 "Many miners of Temsoar joined the communists during the civil war and never returned home. As a result, the mines are in sore need of more labourers which we must provide. Few skills are required, so we can easily hire many unemployed and impoverished griffons who lost everything in the war. We will pay them decent wages to compensate for the great danger of being a miner, of course."
BRF_kivessin_university:0 "Kivessin's University of Culture and Science"
BRF_kivessin_university_desc:0 "The capital of the former Principality of Kivessin, now the capital of the Kingdom of Brodfeld, should become the finest and most civilized city in the realm. Therefore the King plans to invite foreign scientists and artists to be teachers in the old Royal University. Foreign emissaries will surely be impressed by our sophistication! As long as they don't leave the city limits, that is."

#CIVIL WAR
BRF_start_cw:0 "War. War never Changes."
BRF_start_cw_desc:0 "Our beloved country has been engulfed in the savage storm of civil war. The red tide wishes to drown us and destroy everything we hold dear. They want to take away our lands, our workshops, our mines and oil wells and homes. No one shall own anything except them. They are no more than robber rabble, as bad as the wicked bandits of Blackrock. Oh King Kloseu, lead your people to victory and salvation! May Oester guide you!"

### BRODFELD EVENTS ####

prywhen.2.t:0 "Request Help?"
prywhen.2.d:0 "The filthy communists have the upper claw over us and we need to resort to extreme measures. None of the neighbouring nations wish to participate in this war on our side, but in this desperate hour we shall send a deal to the Outlaws of Blackrock and promise them a share in the spoils of war. Loot is the only thing those brutes desire, after all."
prywhen.2.a:0 "Do it."
prywhen.2.b:0 "We cannot trust those savages!"
## EVENT FOR BANDITS ###
prywhen.3.t:0 "Help Brodfeld?"
prywhen.3.d:0 "The Kingdom of Brodfeld is losing ground to the Griffon Liberation Army at an alarming rate. We have received a communique from Brodfeld officially requesting our help in their war effort. While supporting Brodfeld is not necessarily in our best interest, stopping the spread of communism certainly is. We don't want Redglad's gang to 'liberate' us, do we?"
prywhen.3.a:0 "Time to put the Reds in their place!"
prywhen.3.b:0 "Why should we care about their problems?"

prywhen.4.t:0 "The Bandits refuse to help"
prywhen.4.d:0 "The Blackrock Bandits have responded to our request for help. Sadly, they do not see the urgency of the situation and refuse to help us in our struggle against the communists."
prywhen.4.a:0 "Bah, we don't need their help anyways!"
prywhen.4.b:0 ""

brodfeld.1.t:0 "Foreign Military Aid?"
brodfeld.1.d:0 "While none of our neighbours wish to directly intervene in the conflict which in their eyes is an internal matter, perhaps we can gain indirect aid from them. After all, if the communists win, they will spread their wicked revolution and bring ruin to their fair countries."
brodfeld.1.a:0 "Yes, send messengers to all of our neighbours!"
brodfeld.2.t:0 "Brodfeld Requests Military Aid!"
brodfeld.2.d:0 "They are in the state of civil war against peasant rebels that have the idea of overthrowing the old rightful regime. It is possible that if the revolution succeeds, it will spread like cancer to us as well. Should we assist the King?"
brodfeld.2.a:0 "Yes! Send support!"
brodfeld.2.b:0 "It's their problem."
brodfeld.3.t:0 "Foreign Military Advisors Arrived!"
brodfeld.3.t_not_arrived:0 "No one sent help!"
brodfeld.3.d:0 "Foreign advisors and volunteers have arrived to support and fight for our cause in the war! We stand united against the Red Menace which seeks to undo all that we hold dear."
brodfeld.3.d_not_arrived:0 "Out of all our neighbours, nobody provided any help to us! They are too foolish to recognize the threat posed by Redglad's bandits."
brodfeld.3.a:0 "Great!"
brodfeld.3.b:0 "All of you will regret this!"

brodfeld.4.t:0 "Brodfeld Requests Military Aid!"
brodfeld.4.d:0 "They are in the state of civil war against peasant rebels that have the idea of overthrowing the old rightful regime. It is possible that if the revolution succeeds, it will spread like cancer to us as well. Should we assist the King?."
brodfeld.4.a:0 "Yes! Send support!"
brodfeld.4.b:0 "It's their problem."

brodfeld.5.t:0 "Brodfeld Requests Economical Help"
brodfeld.5.d:0 "The Kingdom of Brodfeld is fighting a bloody civil war against communist peasant rebels. The leaders of the Kingdom beg us to help the suffering economy of the country, which has been almost completely devastated by the conflict."
brodfeld.5.a:0 "Of course."
brodfeld.5.b:0 "Again, it's their problem."

brodfeld.7.t:0 "Marsh Brigades"
brodfeld.7.d:0 "The Terrible Marsh is a desolate and cursed wasteland inhabited by few. Even before the war our control of the region was tenuous, limited to the rich oilfields in the outskirts of the swamps. We know that tribes of savages inhabit the magical, beast-infested marshes, and while they are backwards, they could still help us with the war. So we sent a squad to sail along the Evi river and try to contact these tribes, and it seems they were successful. Tribal warbands have emerged from the marshes, armed with rifles our soldiers had brought them, ready to kill everything in sight. This will certainly be a surprise for the red filth!"
brodfeld.7.a:0 "Excellent! Promote everyone in that squad."

brodfeld.8.t:0 ""

brodfeld.8.a:0 ""

brodfeld.13.t:0 "Tank Quest!"
brodfeld.13.d:0 "There are rumours that the Skyfall Trade Federation purchased several armoured mechanical beasts from ponyland over the ocean. Those machines spit fire and can drive on their own. Their government recently constructed a military factory and started manufacturing the magical creations in secret, away from the public eye. Luckily, one of the federal officials spilled the beans to our prince's mother-in-law, who is a daughter of burgmeister of Fezera and was visiting Skyfall. We should embark a party for the journey and sail west to acquire on of the few models. This might as well be the key to our victory in the civil war. The speed of the operation and reliance of the pirate ship crew that we managed to hire, as they were the only ones to sail these waters, will depend on the amount of pay."
brodfeld.13.a:0 "Let them feel like kings!"
brodfeld.13.b:0 "Buy them rum!"
brodfeld.13.c:0 "We can't give them much."
brodfeld.13.e:0 "For our ancestors' sake, we can't waste time on nonsense!"

brodfeld.14.t:0 "The Tank has Arrived!"
brodfeld.14.d:0 "The journey ended and the pirates kept their word, they didn't run away with the money. What's more important, they brought back a present for us! We shall organise a new division and push the beast to battle! Let the miracle weapon lead us to victory!"
brodfeld.14.a:0 "Hurraah!"

brodfeld.15.t:0 "The Civil War is Over!"
brodfeld.15.d:0 "Since the last communist forces have capitulated, we are ready to begin our rehabilitation."
brodfeld.15.a:0 "Great."

brodfeld.21.t:0 "The Civil War is Over!"
brodfeld.21.d:0 "After a long struggle, the civil war has at last come to an end. Yet the suffering continues, for our once fair and beautiful country lies in ruin. Food prices are sky-high, trade has come to a halt and the infrastructure is badly damaged. Now we must rebuild and recover, as well as punish the scum responsible for the devastation."
brodfeld.21.a:0 "Brodfeld shall prevail!"

These brutes wish to take away your precious farmland and give it to vile robbers and peddlers, all in the name of equality. They seek to undo the natural order of the world, for in their eyes all are equal. They say you, hard-working and proud peasants of Prywhen, are as lowly as your ignorant young sons, cruel bandits in the woods and lazy beggars in the towns. Do you wish to live in such a society? Or will you stand with me against this insanity? You, my dear subjects, shall be enlisted in the royal army of Brodfeld! Today!"

They are going to slaughter you, burn your villages and steal your lands. Do not let them do this! To arms!"

brodfeld.24.d:0 "Hear my plea! The fish that you bring us enriched the tables of the people of Prywhen for many years! The crops that you cultivate under the warm southern sun brought cheer and happiness to every loyal subject of mine. Beware now, as the red bandits are approaching this land, there will be no joy anymore. Their claws will take away your land, your food, your shelters. Join the royal army now!
