#CHARACTER DESCRIPTIONS & ADVISORS
BRF_Kloseu_desc:0 "King Kloseu de Kissau is the first ruler of the Kingdom of Brodfeld. He became the Prince of Brodfeld in 963 ALB and was elected Domnitor (ruling prince) of Kivessin and Sydia in 965 ALB. In 973 ALB, when the Griffonian Empire was falling apart, Kloseu declared independence and claimed the title of King of Brodfeld. He was crowned in the Grand Temple of Oester in Kivessin by Prelate Denali.\n\nDuring his rule Brodfeld grew wealthier and became known as the ricebasket of Griffonia, yet poor weather caused the Great Famine in 995 ALB. After the economic crisis of the new millenium, Kloseu signed the Emergency Constitution in 1001 ALB which granted him autocratic powers and cracked down on any disorder and dissent, restoring stability in Brodfeld.\n\nThe peace was brief, however, as in 1004 ALB an assassination attempt was made on him while he was spectating a military parade in Kivessin with his wife. He was merely wounded on his cheek, but his wife died in his arms. Afterwards he blamed communists and banned all communist organizations, yet members of GLA resisted arrest and rebelled. The civil war began."

#CIVIL WAR RECONSTRUCTION
BRF_reopen_ports:0 "Reopen The Port of Sydia"
BRF_reopen_ports_desc:0 "The old capital of the Principality of Sydia has always been the largest and busiest port in Prywhen. The war, however, made foreign traders abandon it and forced us to conscript many of the local fishergriffs. Now that peace and order have been restored, merchants and fishers can get back to business! We will repair the port, lower trade tariffs and ease taxation on fish markets, thus helping our economy recover."
BRF_qwoptia_wood:0 "Lifov Forestry"
BRF_qwoptia_wood_desc:0 "Out of all the myriad materials needed for the reconstruction effort, wood stands above all else. By investing in sawmills and nationalizing the forestry companies of Crowoia and Qwoptia we can begin mass production of cheap yet versatile lumber. And after the reconstruction is over, we will have a strong forest industry ready to make profit!"
BRF_nasom_dam:0 "White Flower's N.A.S.O.M Dam"
BRF_nasom_dam_desc:0 "Mason of Sydia has approached us with intriguing plans for a project he called N.A.S.O.M.(National Action to Secure Our Modernization): The construction of a hydroelectric dam on the Pry river which will be able to produce many megawatts of energy. While it may be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to build, Mason says he will take care of everything as long as we provide workers."
# If we draft some of our unemployed and idle subjects, this will not be a problem. We will, of course, provide our loyal labourers a lifelihood by paying a decent salary, thus helping them get back on their paws.\n\nA new, modern dam will be a sign of a new age in Prywhen and will help us with the electrification of our Kingdom."
BRF_rice_fields:0 "Our Immense, Boundless Rice Fields" 
#Our HUGE tracts of land
BRF_rice_fields_desc:0 "Decades ago, Brodfeld was known the ricebasket of Griffonia. Sadly, poor weather ruined everything and eventually caused the Great Famine of 995 ALB (Communist claims about the famine being caused by nobles exporting all the food is pure propaganda). Now it is time to restore that title! We shall redistribute the land confiscated from the red scum and subsidize our landowners and peasants."
BRF_prosperity:0"Live in Prosperity"
BRF_prosperity_desc:0"With foreign merchant ships arriving in Sydia, fishers catching fish in the Bay of Salt, our unemployed conscripted to work on the White Flower dam and houses being rebuilt with lumber from Lifov, we are quickly beginning to recover. Much work remains to be done, but the seeds have been planted, and from them golden flowers shall sprout and eventually bloom."
BRF_river_ferry:0"Evi River Ferry"
BRF_river_ferry_desc:0"Communist pig dog sabotage might've ruined most of our regular roads, but the watery highways of nature are invincible: Rivers! While our corvée labourers repair the road network, we will invest in ferries and river patrols. This should ensure regular and safe traffic along the great and holy Evi River."
BRF_new_schools:0 "New Schools Across the Nation"
BRF_new_schools_desc:0 "Prelate Denali and the clergy are grateful to us for saving them from godless communists, who wished to eradicate religion and create a secular state. Therefore they are more than willing to cooperate with us in the education of our populace. We shall establish church schools, where our ignorant subjects are taught to read, count and respect Gods and Kings!"
BRF_develop_oil:0 "Repair Our Oil Wells"
BRF_develop_oil_desc:0 "The Terrible Marsh is a cursed land, inhabited mostly by tribal griffons and magical monsters. But it is far from worthless, as beneath the marshes lie vast oil deposits. The wells were badly damaged during the war, but with funds from our recovering economy, we can invest in repairing them."
BRF_sydacute_highway:0 "Sydia - Temsoar Highway"
BRF_sydacute_highway_desc:0 "Our progress in repairing damaged roads has gone well. So well, in fact, that we could start building new ones! The King has plans for a wide, paved road from Sydia to the isolated mining town of Temsoar. We will have to cut our way through the thick Acute Forest, but there's nothing our stout corvée labourers can't overcome."
BRF_kivsydia_railway:0 "Kivessin - Sydia Railway"
BRF_kivsydia_railway_desc:0 "Another infrastructure project in our blessed King's mind is the Kivessin-Sydia railway, first of its kind in Prywhen. While the Evi river already provides an excellent route of transportation, there is no doubt that modern trains are much faster than ferries and have higher capacity. This shall be a sign of a new, modern age in Prywhen!"
BRF_rice_cooking:0 "\"100 Ways to Cook Rice\""
BRF_rice_cooking_desc:0 "Royal printing presses in Sydia, Larios and Kivessin have been tasked with printing hundreds of thousands of copies of a new book, written by the finest culinary minds in Prywhen. It will explain in detail how to prepare various meals out of rice and ensure that it is healthy and filling to eat. The guide will contain illustrations and simple writing that our farmers can read with ease."
BRF_hire_miners:0 "Hire Workers for Temsoar Mines"
BRF_hire_miners_desc:0 "Many miners of Temsoar joined the communists during the civil war and never returned home. As a result, the mines are in sore need of more labourers which we must provide. Few skills are required, so we can easily hire many unemployed and impoverished griffons who lost everything in the war. We will pay them decent wages to compensate for the great danger of being a miner, of course."
BRF_kivessin_university:0 "Kivessin's University of Culture and Science"
BRF_kivessin_university_desc:0 "The capital of the former Principality of Kivessin, now the capital of the Kingdom of Brodfeld, should become the finest and most civilized city in the realm. Therefore the King plans to invite foreign scientists and artists to be teachers in the old Royal University. Foreign emissaries will surely be impressed by our sophistication! As long as they don't leave the city limits, that is."

#CIVIL WAR
BRF_start_cw:0 "War. War never Changes."
BRF_start_cw_desc:0 "Our beloved country has been engulfed in the savage storm of civil war. The red tide wishes to drown us and destroy everything we hold dear. They want to take away our lands, our workshops and our homes. No one except their party will own anything. They are no more than robber rabble, as bad as the wicked bandits of Blackrock. Oh King Kloseu, lead your people to victory and salvation! May Oester guide you!"
BRF_army_unemployed:0 "Conscript the Unemployed"
BRF_army_unemployed_desc:0 "The decade-long economic crisis and the civil war have left hundreds of thousands of griffons unemployed, loitering around in our cities and towns. We should put them to work -- by giving them guns and basic training. They should be thankful, for is there any duty more noble than the slaughter of communist scum?"
BRF_equip_workers:0 "Arm The Workers"
BRF_equip_workers_desc:0 "Desperate times call for desperate measures. While so far workers in factories and workshops have been contributing to our war effort indirectly, we now need their more direct aid from them. While the husbands go to the front, their wives and children shall replace them in the factories. All of our people, no matter the age or gender, must unite to fight against the blight of communism!"
BRF_every_beak:0 "Every Beak Counts"
BRF_every_beak_desc:0 "We have no option. The communists are coming, ready to rape and slaughter. In our darkest hour everyone must fight! Those who cannot be given guns will arm themselves with tools and boldly charge against the accursed foe. May Arcturus give us all strength with which to smite our wicked foe! Long live the King! Long live Brodfeld! Long live Prywhen! Forward, with the help of Gods!"
BRF_calm_winds:0 "Calm The Winds"
BRF_calm_winds_desc:0 "Our nation is in disarray, with untold masses of griffons fleeing the country to Cyanolisia, Lushi, Gryphus or even Gryphia. With food running out, crime and riots are commonplace in the cities while the countryside is deserted as roving bands of red bandits loot and burn what they can. It is time to begin a propaganda campaign, where our King will persuade the people to remain calm and carry on."
BRF_mobility_key:0 "Mobility Is The Key"
BRF_mobility_key_desc:0 "It is clear that new, self-driving vehicles will revolutionize warfare. Perhaps this is the edge we need to win the war. As soon as possible, we must begin production of trucks that can quickly transport our troops where they are needed."
BRF_not_here:0 "Not Here. Not Now."
BRF_not_here_desc:0 "We do not have an infinite pool of griffonpower to draw from. Keeping this in mind, we must ensure that the wounded don't always die and that camp epidemics are kept to a minimum. Specialized field hospital companies would accomplish these things well."
BRF_clear_commands:0 "Clear Commands"
BRF_clear_commands_desc:0 "Our army still uses flags, banners, drums and trumpets to communicate and relay orders, which sometimes results in confusion. In 1006 ALB almost a hundred royal soldiers died after a communication error. This must never happen again. We will acquire radios from Wingbardy and introduce modern communication to our military."
BRF_mic_check:0 "Testing, Testing, 1, 2, 3."
BRF_mic_check_desc:0 "Now that the Royal Army is beginning to use radios, we can proceed to organize specialized communication companies. This will greatly improve the performance of our divisions on the battlefield."
BRF_temporal_carrot:0 "Tighten The Belt"
BRF_temporal_carrot_desc:0 "The nobility of the nation still has a good amount of food in their storages which they are unwilling to give to their peasants. Their greed will not be tolerated in this time of crisis! We will send soldiers to confiscate food and give it to those in need. Any arguments that the King should give away his food as well will be dismissed. His Majesty must remain well-fed and healthy."
BRF_war_council:0 "Royal Laboratory"
BRF_war_council_desc:0 "Thanks to a decade-long economic crisis, years of civil war and a severe brain-drain, research has stopped almost entirely. This obviously hinders our war effort. Mason of Kivessin wishes to address this issue and has proposed the construction of a secret laboratory under the Royal Palace, where scientists can work safely with generous royal funding."
BRF_deep_plan:0 "A Deep Plan"
BRF_deep_plan_desc:0 "Recent enemy offensives have pushed us back and cut off our capital! Our commanding officers must meet and come up with a plan to defeat the red hounds. Only by working together can they form a grand strategy that will win the war for us!"
BRF_high_command:0 "Military High Command"
BRF_high_command_desc:0 "The recent meeting proved what a boon centralized cooperation can be. It is time we reform our army, form a high command and reduce the independence of officers. Perhaps increased discipline will also prevent our commanders from being distracted by raids on any villages they come across."
BRF_supply_logistics:0 "Modern Logistics"
BRF_supply_logistics_desc:0 "Logistics win wars, not guns or soldiers. And sadly our logistics are primitive, with our soldiers relying on foraging (a nice way to say 'pillaging and robbing') to supply themselves. We must set up modern logistic chains with supply depots, dedicated baggage trains and contracts with suppliers."
BRF_ease_conscription:0 "Ease Conscription"
BRF_ease_conscription_desc:0 "These hard times of war take a toll on our people, especially those who are forced to serve in the Royal Army. Yet this suffering is a necessary pain and we are in need of more soldiers. Our high command has begun to reform conscription, by for example clamping down on desertion during training, relaxing eligibility requirements and abolishing nobles' exemption from service."
BRF_operation_violet:0 "Operation: Violet"
BRF_operation_violet_desc:0 "There are many knightly orders in Prywhen, most of which are chivalric orders with no military purpose. Some, however, contain the finest warriors in the Evi valley. We should gather the best of the best together, conscript them for the Royal Army and through rigorous training turn them into true supersoldiers."
BRF_censure_press:0 "Press Censorship"
BRF_censure_press_desc:0 "While most printing presses are owned by the crown and are producing propaganda every day, some independent publishers are spreading lies, defeatist ideas and even communist sympathies. This cannot be allowed, for it can demoralize our soldiers and our people and ultimately cost us victory. We must stop this nonsense immediately."

BRF_foreign_industrial_aid:0 "Foreign Industrial Aid"
BRF_foreign_industrial_aid_desc:0 "Asking for economic aid will surely be considered a reasonable request, for our people suffer from our shattered economy. We won't tell them that some of the funds will be used to fight the war."
BRF_military_aid:0 "Foreign Military Aid"
BRF_military_aid_desc:0 "While most countries see the war as our internal matter, we can convince them that a communist victory would be a major problem for them, and thus persuade them to aid us militarily."
BRF_foreign_engineers:0 "Foreign Engineers"
BRF_foreign_engineers_desc:0 "Most of our highly educated griffons have fled the country to Wingbardy, Sicameon or Lushi. They are unlikely to return any time soon, so we need foreign replacements."
BRF_purchase_secret_tank_prototype:0 "Tank Quest"
BRF_purchase_secret_tank_prototype_desc:0 "It is clear by now that something exceptional is needed to win the war: A miraculous wonder weapon from abroad."

BRF_kivesin_behind_desc:0 "Kivessin has been the capital of the Kingdom since its foundation. It is also the second largest city, with many factories and workshops, and is home to many loyalists. If the enemy manages to take it, not only will it be a great strategic victory but a moral one as well.\n\nThis must NOT happen."
BRF_brodfeld_stands:0 "Brodfeld Still Stands!"
BRF_brodfeld_stands_desc:0 "We have suffered devastating setbacks and the red horde encroaches upon us. Yet the capital still stands, and as long as it does, Brodfeld stands as well. We must continue to hold it at all costs! Long live the King! Death to Redglad and his crooks!"

BRF_stop_retreat_desc:0 "At last, victory is near, which many of our hardened soldiers find hard to believe. The enemy is routing in most sectors with only a few scattered pockets of resistance remaining. We must not allow them to flee abroad, lest they come back to haunt us. Hunt them all down like the vermin they are and stop their cowardly retreat!"

### BRODFELD EVENTS ####

brodfeld_rework.1.t:0 "Work For The Unemployed!"
brodfeld_rework.1.d:0 "Our police forces in cities and the local militia in towns have gathered an impressive crowd of unemployed and idle griffons, who have been given a basic training in using guns, fighting in formation and following orders. Most of them grasped the basics, and that is good enough for we have no time or resources for anything more. Now we will send them to the front and hope the communists are terrified by our sudden increase in numbers!"
brodfeld_rework.1.a:0 "Onwards, to a brighter future!"
brodfeld_rework.1.b:0 "Get 3 divisions of Brodfeld's unemployed in our capital, Kivessin"
brodfeld_rework.2.t:0 "Put Away The Worktools!"
brodfeld_rework.2.d:0 "Tens of thousands of our factory workers bid farewell to their loved ones today as they begin their march to the front. They, too, have received only the most basic training in this dire time, but with the blessings of Arcturus and Oester they will fight like true soldiers. Each draftee was given a portrait of the King to inspire them and to remind them of where their loyalty lies.\n\nNow, for the first time in the history of Prywhen, single ladies and mothers have started working in the factories, though they lack work experience and often have children to take care of. Nevertheless, it is still better than having the workshops remain silent."
brodfeld_rework.2.a:0 "A tactical necessity."
brodfeld_rework.2.a:0 "Get 4 divisions of Brodfeld's workers in our capital, Kivessin"
brodfeld_rework.3.t:0 "In The Name Of The King, Defend Our Lands!"
brodfeld_rework.3.d:0 "Thousands upon thousands of civilians have been armed, though we have nowhere near enough resources to give them all even basic training. We have no alternative but to simply throw these elders, cripples, mothers and children into battle. It is our last and perhaps only hope to push back the red tide! Yet our people are not afraid, for death in battle is preferable to life under communism.\n\nKing Kloseu himself appeared outside of his palace for the first time in months, still wary of red assassins lurking in the shadows and nervously glancing around him. Yet he mustered his courage and appeared on stage in the central square of Kivessin, which was packed full of griffons who had mere weeks ago been innocent civilians. To ensure everyone could hear the King, a Wingbardian microphone and a loudspeaker had been placed on stage, one of the only ones in Prywhen and as expensive as a mansion. Kloseu approached the microphone, cleared his throat and spoke.\n\n'My dear subjects! You all must know that I would not force you to fight if the situation was not most dire and desperate. Indeed it is, for communist scum have beaten back our armies and are approaching the capital, which they aim to loot, burn and pillage. Do you now understand? You will be forced to fight no matter what; Be thankful I have given you guns to defend yourself and your families with.'\n\nSuddenly Kloseu's purple eyes lit up with fury.'And if any of you think otherwise, that the communist filth are liberators and bringers of peace and prosperity, I will say to you: What utter fools you are! They care for nought but creating their utopia no matter the cost. Otherwise, would have they ruined our country? Would have their burned our fields? Would have they murdered their brothers for staying loyal to me? Would have they murdered my gentle and loving wife?!'\n\nKloseu was panting heavily, a tear flowing down his cheek into his scar. 'Trust me, my brave subjects, you will receive no mercy from those barbarians. Give them none in return! Now onwards, to the barricades! Defend your homes and families at all costs! And do not fear death, for Arcturus is waiting for you all in the afterlife!'\n\nFor the first time in a decade, a huge crowd was cheering for Kloseu and chanting his name. He smiled, proud of his people."
brodfeld_rework.3.a:0 "May Oester help us all!"
brodfeld_rework.3.b:0 "We gave a gun to anyone we found..."
brodfeld_rework.4.t:0 "An Old Friendship"
brodfeld_rework.4.d:0 "Our military officers met in a tent on a rainy night and discussed until daybreak. Many ideas and suggestions were shared, yet most of them were deemed impractical, overly ambitious or simply moronic. In the end, though, one plan emerged: Requesting foreign assistance.\n\nWhile some officers were too proud to admit it, we are weak alone, with our economy in tatters and the enemy controlling half the country. Yet we don't have to be alone. Surely, foreign nations will recognize the threat of Redglad's radical revolution and send us immediate aid. We can especially look to Wingbardy, for the Talonuel dynasty is an old friend of the de Kissaus and will certainly help us in our darkest hour. For us to receive any aid from them, we must hold the port of Sydia at all costs."
brodfeld_rework.4.a:0 "Send a messenger to Karthin and pray to Boreas."
brodfeld_rework.4.b:0 "§RThe state of Sydia must remain in our control for us to receive aid from Wingbardy§!\n"
brodfeld_rework.5_t_success:0 "A Gift From Garibald!"
brodfeld_rework.5_d_success:0 "A ship from Wingbardy arrived in the harbour of Sydia today! Our people greeted the foreign sailors joyously as dozens of containers filled with modern rifles and equipment were unloaded from the vessel. Their captain told our harbourmaster that it was a 'Gift from his majesty' and wished us luck with winning the war. Boreas bless Garibald!"
brodfeld_rework.5.a:0 "We are deeply grateful!"
brodfeld_rework.5_t_fail:0 "A Missed Opportunity"
brodfeld_rework.5_d_fail:0 "Our scouts informed us today that a foreign merchant ship was seen off the coast, flying the colours of Wingbardy. It approached our port, but when the communists fired warning shots it turned around and sailed back home. We will never know what the ship was bringing to us..."
brodfeld_rework.5.b:0 "Boreas has abandoned us..."
brodfeld_rework.6.t:0 "When The Winged Knights Arrived!"
brodfeld_rework.6.d:0 "The rigorous and extensive training program is complete and Operation: Violet is declared a success. Thousands of elite warriors now stand ready to serve their King, clad in shining gilded armour and wielding the finest weapons in the Kingdom. They are strong, fearless, utterly loyal to Kloseu and ready to die for him in glorious battle."
brodfeld_rework.6.a:0 "Death from above make our enemy kneel!"
brodfeld_rework.6.b:0 "This will spawn two divisions of §YKnights.§!"

#Old events
prywhen.2.t:0 "Request Help?"
prywhen.2.d:0 "The filthy communists have the upper claw over us and we need to resort to extreme measures. None of the neighbouring nations wish to participate in this war on our side, but in this desperate hour we shall send a deal to the Outlaws of Blackrock and promise them a share in the spoils of war. Loot is the only thing those brutes desire, after all."
prywhen.2.a:0 "Do it."
prywhen.2.b:0 "We cannot trust those savages!"
## EVENT FOR BANDITS ###
prywhen.3.t:0 "Help Brodfeld?"
prywhen.3.d:0 "The Kingdom of Brodfeld is losing ground to the Griffon Liberation Army at an alarming rate. We have received a communique from Brodfeld officially requesting our help in their war effort. While supporting Brodfeld is not necessarily in our best interest, stopping the spread of communism certainly is. We don't want Redglad's gang to 'liberate' us, do we?"
prywhen.3.a:0 "Time to put the Reds in their place!"
prywhen.3.b:0 "Why should we care about their problems?"

prywhen.4.t:0 "The Bandits refuse to help"
prywhen.4.d:0 "The Blackrock Bandits have responded to our request for help. Sadly, they do not see the urgency of the situation and refuse to help us in our struggle against the communists."
prywhen.4.a:0 "Bah, we don't need their help anyways!"
prywhen.4.b:0 ""

brodfeld.1.t:0 "Foreign Military Aid?"
brodfeld.1.d:0 "While none of our neighbours wish to directly intervene in the conflict which in their eyes is an internal matter, perhaps we can gain indirect aid from them. After all, if the communists win, they will spread their wicked revolution and bring ruin to their fair countries."
brodfeld.1.a:0 "Yes, send messengers to all of our neighbours!"

brodfeld.2.t:0 "Brodfeld Requests Military Aid!"
brodfeld.2.d:0 "They are in the state of civil war against peasant rebels that have the idea of overthrowing the old rightful regime. It is possible that if the revolution succeeds, it will spread like cancer to us as well. Should we assist the King?"
brodfeld.2.a:0 "Yes! Send support!"
brodfeld.2.b:0 "It's their problem."

brodfeld.3.t:0 "Foreign Military Advisors Arrived!"
brodfeld.3.t_not_arrived:0 "No one sent help!"
brodfeld.3.d:0 "Foreign advisors and volunteers have arrived to support and fight for our cause in the war! We stand united against the Red Menace which seeks to undo all that we hold dear."
brodfeld.3.d_not_arrived:0 "Out of all our neighbours, nobody provided any help to us! They are too foolish to recognize the threat posed by Redglad's bandits."
brodfeld.3.a:0 "Great!"

brodfeld.5.d:0 "The Kingdom of Brodfeld is fighting a bloody civil war against communist peasant rebels. The leaders of the Kingdom beg us to help the suffering economy of the country, which has been almost completely devastated by the conflict."
brodfeld.5.a:0 "Of course."
brodfeld.5.b:0 "Again, it's their problem."

brodfeld.7.t:0 "Marsh Warbands"
brodfeld.7.d:0 "The Terrible Marsh is a desolate and cursed wasteland inhabited by few. Even before the war our control of the region was tenuous, limited to the rich oilfields in the outskirts of the swamps. We know that tribes of savages inhabit the magical, beast-infested marshes, and while they are backwards, they could still help us with the war.\n\nTherefore we sent a squad to sail along the Evi river and try to contact these tribes, and it seems they were successful. Tribal warbands have emerged from the marshes, armed with muskets our soldiers had brought them, ready to kill everything in sight. This will certainly be a surprise for the red filth!"
brodfeld.7.a:0 "Excellent! Promote everyone in that squad."

brodfeld.8.t:0 "Operation: Boiled Rice"
brodfeld.8.d:0 "While we are beginning to run out of food, so is our cursed enemy. To win the war, it will be necessary to sabotage their ricefields so their next harvest will fail miserably! Infiltrators have been sent to arm and organize local peasants, who are furious about the communists' confiscation of their private farms. Together, they will begin a campaign of sabotage and terror, burning down the new property of GLA and forcing them to divert troops away from the frontline. This might be just what we need to turn the tide of the war!"
brodfeld.8.a:0 "The bastards won't be having any boiled rice next winter."

brodfeld.13.t:0 "Tank Quest!"
brodfeld.13.d:0 "There are rumours that the Skyfall Trade Federation purchased several armoured mechanical beasts from ponyland over the ocean. Those machines spit fire and can drive on their own. Their government recently constructed a military factory and started manufacturing the magical creations in secret, away from the public eye. Luckily, one of the federal officials spilled the beans to our prince's mother-in-law, who is a daughter of burgmeister of Fezera and was visiting Skyfall. We should embark a party for the journey and sail west to acquire on of the few models. This might as well be the key to our victory in the civil war. The speed of the operation and reliance of the pirate ship crew that we managed to hire, as they were the only ones willing to do the mission, will depend on the amount of pay."
brodfeld.13.a:0 "Let them feel like kings!"
brodfeld.13.b:0 "Buy them rum!"
brodfeld.13.c:0 "We can't give them much."
brodfeld.13.e:0 "For our ancestors' sake, we can't waste time on nonsense!"

brodfeld.14.t:0 "The Tank Has Arrived!"
brodfeld.14.d:0 "The journey ended and the pirates kept their word, they didn't run away with the money. What's more important, they brought back a present for us! We shall organise a new division and push the beast to battle! Let the miracle weapon lead us to victory!"
brodfeld.14.a:0 "Hurraah!"

brodfeld.15.t:0 "The Civil War Is Over!"
brodfeld.15.d:0 "Since the last communist forces have capitulated, we are ready to begin our rehabilitation."
brodfeld.15.a:0 "Great."

brodfeld.21.t:0 "The Civil War Is Over!"
brodfeld.21.d:0 "After a long struggle, the civil war has at last come to an end. Yet the suffering continues, for our once fair and beautiful country lies in ruin. Food prices are sky-high, trade has come to a halt and the infrastructure is badly damaged. Now we must rebuild and recover, as well as punish the scum responsible for the devastation."
brodfeld.21.a:0 "Brodfeld shall prevail!"

I call to you to defend your homeland from the traitors that have been ravaging this land for years! These brutes wish to take away your precious farmland and give it to vile robbers and peddlers, all in the name of equality. They seek to undo the natural order of the world, for in their eyes all are equal. They say you, hard-working and proud peasants of Prywhen, are as lowly as your ignorant young sons, cruel bandits in the woods and lazy beggars in the towns. Do you wish to live in such a society? Or will you stand with me against this insanity? You, my dear subjects, shall be enlisted in the royal army of Brodfeld!
