#CHARACTER DESCRIPTIONS & ADVISORS
BRF_Kloseu_desc:0 "King Kloseu de Kissau is the first ruler of the Kingdom of Brodfeld. He became the Prince of Brodfeld in 963 ALB and was elected Domnitor (ruling prince) of Kivessin and Sydia in 965 ALB. In 973 ALB, when the Griffonian Empire was falling apart, Kloseu declared independence and claimed the title of King of Brodfeld. He was crowned in the Grand Temple of Eviliana in Kivessin by Prelate Denali.\n\nDuring his rule Brodfeld grew wealthier and became known as the ricebasket of Griffonia, yet poor weather caused the Great Famine in 995 ALB. After the economic crisis of the new millenium, Kloseu signed the Emergency Constitution in 1001 ALB which granted him autocratic powers and cracked down on any disorder and dissent, restoring stability in Brodfeld.\n\nThe peace was brief, however, as in 1004 ALB an assassination attempt was made on him while he was spectating a military parade in Kivessin with his wife. He was merely wounded on his cheek, but his wife died in his arms. Afterwards he blamed communists and banned all communist organizations, yet members of PCP resisted arrest, formed the GLA and rebelled. The civil war began."

#ECONOMY
BRF_reopen_ports:0 "Reopen The Port Of Sydia"
BRF_reopen_ports_desc:0 "The old capital of the Principality of Sydia has always been the largest and busiest port in Prywhen. The war, however, made foreign traders abandon it and forced us to conscript many of the local fishergriffs. Now that peace and order have been restored, merchants and fishers can get back to business! We will repair the port, lower trade tariffs and ease taxation on fish markets, thus helping our economy recover."
BRF_qwoptia_wood:0 "Lifov Forestry"
BRF_qwoptia_wood_desc:0 "Out of all the myriad materials needed for the reconstruction effort, wood stands above all else. By investing in sawmills and nationalizing the forestry companies of Crowoia and Qwoptia we can begin mass production of cheap yet versatile lumber. And after the reconstruction is over, we will have a strong forest industry ready to make profit!"
BRF_nasom_dam:0 "White Flower's N.A.S.O.M Dam"
BRF_nasom_dam_desc:0 "Mason of Sydia has approached us with intriguing plans for a project he called N.A.S.O.M.(National Action to Secure Our Modernization): The construction of a hydroelectric dam on the Pry river which will be able to produce many megawatts of energy. While it may be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to build, Mason says he will take care of everything as long as we provide workers."
# If we draft some of our unemployed and idle subjects, this will not be a problem. We will, of course, provide our loyal labourers a lifelihood by paying a decent salary, thus helping them get back on their paws.\n\nA new, modern dam will be a sign of a new age in Prywhen and will help us with the electrification of our Kingdom."
BRF_rice_fields:0 "Our Boundless Rice Fields" 
#Our HUGE tracts of land
BRF_rice_fields_desc:0 "Decades ago, Brodfeld was known the ricebasket of Griffonia. Sadly, poor weather ruined everything and eventually caused the Great Famine of 995 ALB (Communist claims about the famine being caused by nobles exporting all the food is pure propaganda). Now it is time to restore that title! We shall redistribute the land confiscated from the red scum and subsidize our landowners and peasants."
BRF_prosperity:0"Live In Prosperity"
BRF_prosperity_desc:0"With foreign merchant ships arriving in Sydia, fishers catching fish in the Bay of Salt, our unemployed conscripted to work on the White Flower dam and houses being rebuilt with lumber from Lifov, we are quickly beginning to recover. Much work remains to be done, but the seeds have been planted, and from them golden flowers shall sprout and eventually bloom."
BRF_river_ferry:0"Evi River Ferry"
BRF_river_ferry_desc:0"Communist pig dog sabotage might've ruined most of our regular roads, but the watery highways of nature are invincible: Rivers! While our corvée labourers repair the road network, we will invest in ferries and river patrols. This should ensure regular and safe traffic along the great and holy Evi River."
BRF_new_schools:0 "New Schools Across the Nation"
BRF_new_schools_desc:0 "Prelate Denali and the clergy are grateful to us for saving them from godless communists, who wished to eradicate religion and create a secular state. Therefore they are more than willing to cooperate with us in the education of our populace. We shall establish church schools, where our ignorant subjects are taught to read, count and respect Gods and Kings!"
BRF_develop_oil:0 "Repair Our Oil Wells"
BRF_develop_oil_desc:0 "The Terrible Marsh is a cursed land, inhabited mostly by tribal griffons and magical monsters. But it is far from worthless, as beneath the marshes lie vast oil deposits. The wells were badly damaged during the war, but with funds from our recovering economy, we can invest in repairing them."
BRF_sydacute_highway:0 "Royal Sydia-Temsoar Road"
BRF_sydacute_highway_desc:0 "Our progress in repairing damaged roads has gone well. So well, in fact, that we could start building new ones! The King has plans for a wide, paved road from Sydia to the isolated mining town of Temsoar. We will have to cut our way through the thick Acute Forest, but there's nothing our stout corvée labourers can't overcome."
BRF_kivsydia_railway:0 "Royal Kivessin-Sydia Railway"
BRF_kivsydia_railway_desc:0 "Another infrastructure project in our blessed King's mind is the Kivessin-Sydia railway, first of its kind in Prywhen. While the Evi river already provides an excellent route of transportation, there is no doubt that modern trains are much faster than ferries and have higher capacity. This shall be a sign of a new, modern age in Prywhen!"
BRF_rice_cooking:0 "\"100 Ways To Cook Rice\""
BRF_rice_cooking_desc:0 "Royal printing presses in Sydia, Larios and Kivessin have been tasked with printing hundreds of thousands of copies of a new book, written by the finest culinary minds in Prywhen. It will explain in detail how to prepare various meals out of rice and ensure that it is healthy and filling to eat. The guide will contain illustrations and simple writing that our farmers can read with ease."
BRF_hire_miners:0 "Hire Workers For Temsoar Mines"
BRF_hire_miners_desc:0 "Many miners of Temsoar joined the communists during the civil war and never returned home. As a result, the mines are in sore need of more labourers which we must provide. Few skills are required, so we can easily hire many unemployed and impoverished griffons who lost everything in the war. We will pay them decent wages to compensate for the great danger of being a miner, of course."
BRF_kivessin_university:0 "Beacon Of Civilization"
BRF_kivessin_university_desc:0 "The capital of the Principality of Kivessin, now the capital of the Kingdom of Brodfeld, should once again become the most civilized city in the realm. The King shall welcome our intelligentsia back home, ensuring them that Prywhen is now safe, and invite foreign teachers as well. Emissaries from abroad will surely be impressed by our sophistication! As long as they don't leave the city limits, that is."
BRF_print_books:0 "More Textbooks, Less Propaganda"
BRF_print_books_desc:0 "Our cookbook campaign has proved to be a success, therefore it is clear we must print more educational and informative textbooks instead of just propaganda! Libraries shall be built across the country and crammed with knowledge-filled books which our students can use for a low cost."
BRF_yearly_fair:0 "Yearly Science Fairs"
BRF_yearly_fair_desc:0 "Mason of Twelt has proposed that we establish a yearly science fair. Our students will form teams and work together on a science project which they shall then present at the fair. The most ground-breaking presentation will receive a Royal Award. This will not only allow us to find talented griffons, but will also popularize science and motivate our students." 
BRF_concrete_building:0 "Reinforced Concrete"
BRF_concrete_building_desc:0 "While concrete has been used in Prywhen for centuries, Mason of Sydia says that mass-production of steel allows us to adopt superior reinforced concrete. With it, even the sky is not the limit when building new constructions! No longer shall earthquakes make our houses and bridges collapse. New standards and regulations will ensure the correct production and use of this miraculous composite material."
BRF_mason_special:0 "Finished Dam"
BRF_mason_special_desc:0 "White Flower's new dam is nearing completion and will be officially opened in a grand ceremony which the King himself will attend. The N.A.S.O.M. project has been a groundbreaking success! Thousands of homes and dozens of factories will be powered by the dam."
BRF_new_excavation:0 "Modern Tools"
BRF_new_excavation_desc:0 "Steam-powered tools are effective, but they must be replaced with new, better tools powered by fuel and electricity. One modern worker can accomplish more than ten backwards workers in the same amount of time! Contracts with Wingbardy will ensure an ample supply of tools of the new age."

#CIVIL WAR
BRF_start_cw:0 "War. War Never Changes."
BRF_start_cw_desc:0 "Our beloved country has been engulfed in the savage storm of civil war. The red tide wishes to drown us and destroy everything we hold dear. They want to take away our lands, our workshops and our homes. No one except their party will own anything. They are no more than robber rabble, as bad as the wicked bandits of Blackrock. Oh King Kloseu, lead your people to victory and salvation! May Eviliana guide you!"
BRF_army_unemployed:0 "Conscript The Unemployed"
BRF_army_unemployed_desc:0 "The decade-long economic crisis and the civil war have left hundreds of thousands of griffons unemployed, loitering around in our cities and towns. We should put them to work -- by giving them guns and basic training. They should be thankful, for is there any duty more noble than the slaughter of communist scum?"
BRF_equip_workers:0 "Arm The Workers"
BRF_equip_workers_desc:0 "Desperate times call for desperate measures. While so far workers in factories and workshops have been contributing to our war effort indirectly, we now need their more direct aid from them. While the husbands go to the front, their wives and children shall replace them in the factories. All of our people, no matter the age or gender, must unite to fight against the blight of communism!"
BRF_every_beak:0 "Every Beak Counts"
BRF_every_beak_desc:0 "We have no option. The communists are coming, ready to rape and slaughter. In our darkest hour everyone must fight! Those who cannot be given guns will arm themselves with tools and boldly charge against the accursed foe. May Arcturius give us all strength with which to smite our wicked foe! Long live the King! Long live Brodfeld! Long live Prywhen! Forward, with the help of Gods!"
BRF_calm_winds:0 "Calm The Winds"
BRF_calm_winds_desc:0 "Our nation is in disarray, with untold masses of griffons fleeing the country to Cyanolisia, Lushi, Gryphus or even Gryphia. With food running out, crime and riots are commonplace in the cities while roving bands of red bandits loot and burn the deserted countryside. It is time to begin a propaganda campaign, where our King will persuade the people to remain calm and carry on."
BRF_mobility_key:0 "Mobility Is The Key"
BRF_mobility_key_desc:0 "It is clear that new, fuel-powered vehicles will revolutionize warfare. Perhaps this is the edge we need to win the war. As soon as possible, we must begin production of trucks that can quickly transport our troops where they are needed."
BRF_not_here:0 "Not Here. Not Now."
BRF_not_here_desc:0 "We do not have an infinite pool of griffonpower to draw from. Keeping this in mind, we must ensure that the wounded don't always die and that camp epidemics are kept to a minimum. Specialized field hospital companies would accomplish these things well."
BRF_clear_commands:0 "Clear Commands"
BRF_clear_commands_desc:0 "Our army still uses flags, banners, drums and trumpets to communicate and relay orders, which sometimes results in confusion. In 1006 ALB almost a hundred royal soldiers died after a communication error. This must never happen again. We will acquire radios from Wingbardy and introduce modern communication to our military."
BRF_mic_check:0 "Testing, Testing, 1, 2, 3."
BRF_mic_check_desc:0 "Now that the Royal Army is beginning to use radios, we can proceed to organize specialized communication companies. This will greatly improve the performance of our divisions on the battlefield."
BRF_temporal_carrot:0 "Tighten The Belt"
BRF_temporal_carrot_desc:0 "The nobility of the nation still has a good amount of food in their storages which they are unwilling to give to their peasants. Their greed will not be tolerated in this time of crisis! We will send soldiers to confiscate food and give it to those in need. Any arguments that the King should give away his food as well will be dismissed. His Majesty must remain well-fed and healthy."
BRF_war_council:0 "Expand The Royal Laboratory"
BRF_war_council_desc:0 "Thanks to a decade-long economic crisis and years of civil war, most of our intelligentsia has fled the country, considerably slowing down our research and development and thus hindering our war effort. Mason of Twelt wishes to address this issue and has proposed the expansion of the secret laboratory under the Royal Palace, so all our scientists can safely work there together with generous royal funding."
BRF_deep_plan:0 "A Deep Plan"
BRF_deep_plan_desc:0 "Recent enemy offensives have pushed us back and cut off our capital! Our commanding officers must meet at once and come up with a plan to defeat the red hounds. Only by working together can they form a grand strategy that will win the war for us!"
BRF_high_command:0 "Military High Command"
BRF_high_command_desc:0 "The meeting of our officers proved what a boon centralized cooperation can be. It is time we reform our army, form a high command and reduce the independence of officers. Perhaps increased discipline will also prevent our commanders from being distracted by raids on any villages they come across."
BRF_supply_logistics:0 "Modern Logistics"
BRF_supply_logistics_desc:0 "Logistics win wars, not guns or soldiers. And sadly our logistics are primitive, with our soldiers relying on foraging (a nice way to say "pillaging and robbing") to supply themselves. We must set up modern logistic chains with supply depots, dedicated baggage trains and contracts with suppliers."
BRF_ease_conscription:0 "Ease Conscription"
BRF_ease_conscription_desc:0 "These hard times of war take a toll on our people, especially those who are forced to serve in the Royal Army. Yet this suffering is a necessary pain and we are in need of more soldiers. Our high command has begun to reform and ease conscription, by for example clamping down on desertion during training, relaxing eligibility requirements and abolishing nobles' exemption from service."
BRF_operation_violet:0 "Operation: Violet"
BRF_operation_violet_desc:0 "There are many knightly orders in Prywhen, most of which are chivalric orders with no military purpose. Some, however, contain the finest warriors in the Evi valley. We should gather the best of the best together, conscript them for the Royal Army and through rigorous training turn them into true supersoldiers."
BRF_censure_press:0 "Press Censorship"
BRF_censure_press_desc:0 "While most printing presses are owned by the crown and are producing propaganda every day, some independent publishers are spreading lies, defeatist ideas and even communist sympathies. This cannot be allowed, for it can demoralize our soldiers and our people and ultimately cost us victory. We must stop this nonsense immediately."

BRF_foreign_industrial_aid:0 "Foreign Economic Aid"
BRF_foreign_industrial_aid_desc:0 "Asking for economic aid will surely be considered a reasonable request, for our people suffer from our shattered economy. We won't tell them that some of the funds will be used to fight the war."
BRF_military_aid:0 "Foreign Military Aid"
BRF_military_aid_desc:0 "While most countries see the war as our internal matter, we can convince them that a communist victory would be a major problem for them, and thus persuade them to aid us militarily."
BRF_foreign_engineers:0 "Foreign Engineers"
BRF_foreign_engineers_desc:0 "Most of our highly educated griffons have fled the country to Wingbardy, Sicameon or Gryphus. They are unlikely to return any time soon, so we need foreign replacements."
BRF_purchase_secret_tank_prototype:0 "Tank Quest"
BRF_purchase_secret_tank_prototype_desc:0 "It is clear by now that something exceptional is needed to win the war: A miraculous wonder weapon from abroad."

BRF_kivesin_behind:0 "Kivessin Behind Us"
BRF_kivesin_behind_desc:0 "Kivessin has been the capital of the Kingdom since its foundation. It is also the second largest city, with many factories and workshops, and is home to many loyalists. If the enemy manages to take it, not only will it be a great strategic victory but a moral one as well.\n\nThis must NOT happen."
BRF_brodfeld_stands:0 "Brodfeld Still Stands!"
BRF_brodfeld_stands_desc:0 "We have suffered devastating setbacks and the red horde encroaches upon us. Yet the capital still stands, and as long as it does, Brodfeld stands as well. We must continue to hold it at all costs so our Kingdom prevails! Long live the King! Death to Redglad and his crooks!"
BRF_break_lines:0 "Break Their Lines"
BRF_break_lines_desc:0 "Despite the recent red offensive, we have managed to turn the tide in our favour! Now we must push our advantage while we still have it, lest the enemy recover."
BRF_stop_retreat:0 "Stop Their Retreat!"
BRF_stop_retreat_desc:0 "At last, victory is near, which many of our hardened soldiers find hard to believe. The enemy is routing in most sectors with only a few scattered pockets of resistance remaining. We must not allow them to flee abroad, or they'll come back to haunt us. Hunt them all down like the vermin they are and stop their cowardly retreat!"

BRF_tame_bear_desc:0 "In the name of justice, the King has ordered our soldiers and militiagriffons to arrest anyone suspected of being a member of PCP, GLA or a sympathiser to the enemy cause. They, along with the numerous prisoners of war, shall all receive fair and just trials! The first suspects in line are the wicked leaders of the revolt..."
BRF_exile_democrats:0 "Exile The Democrats"
BRF_exile_democrats_desc:0 "While PNL and any supporters of democracy and harmony did not participate in the civil war directly, Aquileia is proof that they cannot be trusted. The King orders that they must be exiled, lest they begin a coup or another civil war."

BRF_humble_opinion_desc:0 "The Prince wishes to once again meet with his father and discuss a matter of great importance."

BRF_pro_gov:0 "Continue Propaganda Campaign"
BRF_pro_gov_desc:0 "Peacetime does not mean we must stop publishing propaganda. Quite the opposite! Our control of the press must remain firm, lest revolutinary ideas spread amongst the populace. We cannot risk another civil war!"
BRF_simplify_gov:0 "Government Reforms"
BRF_simplify_gov_desc:0 "Now that peace reigns once more, our government needs to be reformed and modernized. New ministries shall be founded, each with clear responsibilities. A new governing senate will be formed, with members appointed by the King. Privileges of the nobility must also be curtailed. From the ashes, a golden phoenix shall rise!"
BRF_finance_military:0 "Militarize The Economy"
BRF_finance_military_desc:0 "During the civil war, we could barely provide all our soldiers with guns, let alone basic equipment such as uniforms. This is unacceptable and must be addressed. We shall massively increase military spending, impose tariffs on arms imports and nationalize major arms companies, thus creating a military-industrial complex."
BRF_finance_economic:0 "Industrialize The Economy"
BRF_finance_economic_desc:0 "Our reliance on agricultural exports meant that simple poor weather ruined our economy and prevented us from buying food from abroad. It is clear our economy must industrialize! Foreign investments, liberalized commerce and governmental subsidies will all aid our capitalists and their enterprises."

BRF_new_leader:0 "The First Election"
BRF_new_leader_desc:0 "Any kind of democracy is new for the griffons of Prywhen, for they have been ruled by Princes for centuries. It will therefore be a challenge to organize an election, but it must be done for the nation needs new griffons to lead the country now that the King has stepped aside."
BRF_enrico_book:0 "Prime Minister Enrico"
BRF_enrico_book_desc:0 "Enrico Chivaldori of Sydia has won the elections for Prime Minister, gathering 73% of the vote. He will now lead the newly formed government consisting of elected senators and ministers. Their abilities to run the country will be put to the test, for it lies in ruin after the bloody civil war."
BRF_largo_recovery:0 "Largo"
BRF_largo_recovery_desc:0 "Prime Minister Enrico argues that Prywhen must recover slowly and in peace. If we can ensure safety and stability for our people and disarm the military which they now fear so greatly, we will recover on our own, given enough time."
BRF_adagio_recovery:0 "Adagio"
BRF_adagio_recovery_desc:0 "It is clear that a slow recovery combined with demilitarization will only lead us to stagnation. Prime Minister Enrico thinks the government must act and aid the recovery effort, and the military cannot be neglected lest we fall prey to a foreign invasion."
BRF_allegro_recovery:0 "Allegro"

### BRODFELD EVENTS ####

brodfeld_rework.1.t:0 "Work For The Unemployed!"
brodfeld_rework.1.d:0 "Our police forces in cities and the local militia in towns have gathered an impressive crowd of unemployed and idle griffons, who have been given a basic training in using guns, fighting in formation and following orders. Most of them grasped the basics, and that is good enough for we have no time or resources for anything more. Now we will send them to the front and hope the communists are terrified by our sudden increase in numbers!"
brodfeld_rework.1.a:0 "Onwards, to a brighter future!"
brodfeld_rework.1.b:0 "Get 3 divisions of Brodfeld's unemployed in our capital, Kivessin"

brodfeld_rework.2.t:0 "Put Away The Worktools!"
brodfeld_rework.2.d:0 "Tens of thousands of our factory workers bid farewell to their loved ones today as they begin their march to the front. They, too, have received only the most basic training in this dire time, but with the blessings of Arcturius and Eviliana they will fight like true soldiers. Each draftee was given a portrait of the King to inspire them and to remind them of where their loyalty lies.\n\nNow, for the first time in the history of Prywhen, single ladies and mothers have started working in the factories, though they lack work experience and often have children to take care of. Nevertheless, it is still better than having the workshops remain silent."
brodfeld_rework.2.a:0 "A tactical necessity."
brodfeld_rework.2.a:0 "Get 4 divisions of Brodfeld's workers in our capital, Kivessin"

brodfeld_rework.3.t:0 "In The Name Of The King, Defend Our Lands!"
brodfeld_rework.3.d:0 "Thousands upon thousands of civilians have been armed, though we have nowhere near enough resources to give them all even basic training. We have no alternative but to simply throw these elders, cripples, mothers and children into battle. It is our last and perhaps only hope to push back the red tide! Yet our people are not afraid, for death in battle is preferable to life under communism!\n\nKing Kloseu himself appeared in public for the first time in months, wary of red assassins lurking in the shadows and nervously glancing around him. Yet he mustered his courage and appeared on stage in the central square, which was packed full of griffons who had mere weeks ago been innocent civilians. To ensure everyone could hear the King, a Wingbardian microphone and a loudspeaker had been placed on stage, one of the only ones in Prywhen and as expensive as a mansion. Kloseu approached the microphone, cleared his throat and spoke.\n\n"My dear subjects! You all must know that I would not force you to fight if the situation was not most dire and desperate. Indeed it is, for communist scum have beaten back our armies and are approaching us, eager to loot, burn and pillage. Do you now understand? You will be forced to fight no matter what; Be thankful I have given you guns to defend yourself and your families with."\n\nSuddenly Kloseu's purple eyes lit up with fury."And if any of you think otherwise, that the communist filth are liberators and bringers of peace and prosperity, I will say to you: What utter fools you are! They care for nought but creating their utopia no matter the cost. Otherwise, would have they ruined our country? Would have their burned our fields? Would have they murdered their brothers for staying loyal to me? Would have they murdered my gentle and loving wife?!"\n\nKloseu was panting heavily, a tear flowing down his cheek into his scar. "Trust me, my brave subjects, you will receive no mercy from those barbarians. Give them none in return! Now onwards, to the barricades! Defend your homes and families at all costs! And do not fear death, for Arcturius is waiting for you all in the afterlife!"\n\nFor the first time in a decade, a huge crowd was cheering for Kloseu and chanting his name. He smiled, proud of his people."
brodfeld_rework.3.a:0 "May Eviliana help us all!"
brodfeld_rework.3.b:0 "We conscripted everyone we found..."

brodfeld_rework.4.t:0 "A Deep Plan"
brodfeld_rework.4.d:0 "Our military officers met in a tent on a rainy night and discussed until daybreak. Many ideas and suggestions were shared, yet most of them were deemed impractical, overly ambitious or simply moronic. In the end, though, one plan emerged: Requesting foreign assistance.\n\nWhile some officers such as Lexandru were too proud to admit it, we are weak alone, with our economy in tatters and the enemy controlling half the country. Yet we don't have to be alone. Surely, foreign nations will recognize the threat of Redglad's radical revolution and send us immediate aid. We can especially look to Wingbardy, for the Talonuel dynasty is an old friend of the de Kissaus and will certainly help us in our darkest hour. For us to receive any aid from them, we must hold the port of Sydia at all costs."
brodfeld_rework.4.a:0 "Send a messenger to Karthin and pray to Boreas."
brodfeld_rework.4.b:0 "§RThe state of Sydia must remain in our control for us to receive aid from Wingbardy§!\n"

brodfeld_rework.5_t_success:0 "A Gift From Garibald!"
brodfeld_rework.5_d_success:0 "A ship from Wingbardy arrived in the harbour of Sydia today! Our people greeted the foreign sailors joyously as dozens of containers filled with modern rifles and equipment were unloaded from the vessel. Their captain told our harbourmaster that it was a "Gift from his majesty" and wished us luck with winning the war. Boreas bless Garibald!"
brodfeld_rework.5.a:0 "We are deeply grateful!"

brodfeld_rework.5_t_fail:0 "A Missed Opportunity"
brodfeld_rework.5_d_fail:0 "Our scouts informed us today that a foreign merchant ship was seen off the coast, flying the colours of Wingbardy. It approached our port, but when the communists fired warning shots it turned around and sailed back home. We will never know what the ship was bringing to us."
brodfeld_rework.5.b:0 "Boreas has abandoned us..."

brodfeld_rework.6.t:0 "When The Winged Knights Arrived!"
brodfeld_rework.6.d:0 "The rigorous and extensive training program is complete and Operation: Violet is declared a success. Thousands of elite warriors now stand ready to serve their King, clad in shining gilded armour and wielding the finest weapons in the Kingdom. They are strong, fearless, utterly loyal to Kloseu and ready to die for him in glorious battle."
brodfeld_rework.6.a:0 "Death from above make our enemy kneel!"
brodfeld_rework.6.b:0 "This will spawn two divisions of §YKnights.§!"

brodfeld_rework.7.t:0 "Price of Freedom"
brodfeld_rework.7.d:0 "Prywhen has been saved from the tyranny of communism and the liberty of its people is, for now, safe and secure. But victory has come at a terrible cost, for the country lies in ruins, thousands lay dead and most educated Prywhenians live as refugees abroad. Therefore, it is not odd to witness apathy on the streets even as news of triumph spread. For most commoners, the end of the war makes little difference to their miserable and impoverished lives as they bury their loved ones and continue their daily struggle to survive.\n\nNevertheless, the King had ordered a military parade to be held in Kivessin, hoping to lift the spirits of his people. Many griffons attended, only to witness rows upon rows of underequipped and underfed soldiers marching in poor order while military bands played overly pompous music. The golden standards of Brodfeld they carried were torn and dirty. Prince Tomado, who watched the parade with his father, couldn't help but feel that the banners symbolized Prywhen itself."
brodfeld_rework.7.a:0 "The wounds of Prywhen must be healed..."

brodfeld_rework.9.t:0 "The Second Hunt"
brodfeld_rework.9.d:0 "To ensure the stabilty and integrity of Brodfeld, our soldiers and militiagriffons have arrested anyone suspected of being a supporter of PCP, GLA or any other communist or socialist organization. Often, family members of suspects were detained as well, regardless of their age. Last time this was attempted it ended up sparking a civil war, but now the strength of the reds has been shattered and they are unable to resist.\n\nThousands of new prisoners have been brought to already cramped prison camps across the nation, with the largest ones being in Larios and White Flower which hold tens of thousands of prisoners of war. Everyone will remain detained until each individual's role in the Civil War has been thoroughly investigated. Those who took up arms and fought will certainly be convicted of treason and thus receive harsh sentences.\n\nDeath rates are high as malnutrition and disease ravage the crowded camps. Countless griffons are executed each day without trial. Mass graves near the camps fill quickly."
brodfeld_rework.9.a:0 "I have brought peace, freedom, justice and security to my Kingdom."

brodfeld_rework.8.t:0 "The Deportation"
brodfeld_rework.8.d:0 "Unlike the purge of communists, the banishment of democrats received less support among our subjects. Members of the Golden Guard on the other claw strongly agreed with the King and used the opportunity to spread anti-democratic propaganda. They justified the exile by drawing parallels to Aquileia, where democrats plotted with socialists and communists to overthrow the Discret dynasty via violent revolution. Clearly, the exile was a necessary action to secure peace in Prywhen.\n\nPrince Tomado travelled to Sydia, accompanied by a small group of royal guards. The crowded harbour was filled with deportees and ships ready to carry them abroad to countries such as Sicameon and Gryphus. With hasty steps, he went to the ship headed to Wingbardy and was greeted by soldiers.\n\n"Greetings. What brings you here, Prince?"\n\n"I must find a griffon called Enrico Chivaldori. At once."\n\nThe soldiers nodded and obeyed; one read the passenger register while another went into the crowd, shouting the name. Eventually Enrico was found and brought before Tomado. He was wearing a black suit and his signature hat, and carried a suitcase with all of his belongings. When he saw the Prince, his eyes widened.\n\n"Tom? What brings you here? I was just about to board the ship!"\n\n"You're not going anywhere, friend." Tomado gave one of the soldiers a letter with a golden royal seal. He opened it and read it aloud: "I, King Kloseu de Kissau of Brodfeld, hereby grant a royal pardon to Enrico Chivaldori."\n\nEnrico opened his mouth in shock. "What? H-how...?"\n\nThe Prince smiled warmly. "Had to argue with my father for an hour to get him to sign this. You can stay, Rico.""
brodfeld_rework.8.a:0 "Friends are always there for you."

brodfeld_rework.12.t:0 "The Meeting"
brodfeld_rework.12.d:0 "The Prince took a deep breath and knocked on the door of his father's office. Never before had he been courageous enough to tell his father what he truly thought of him, but recent events had changed that.\n\n"Come in," said his father, so he entered. The King was frowning, as he had always been since his wife had been assassinated. "What do you want now? Another royal pardon for another traitor?"\n\n"No. I wanted to tell you what I think about everything that has happened in recent years."\n\nKloseu rolled his eyes. "Fine. Be quick. I have a royal banquet to plan."\n\nTomado sighed, closed his eyes and spoke. "Father, I cannot help but feel like everything was ultimately caused by you. The famine was caused by your trade policy, the assassination of my mother was caused by you assuming dictatorial powers and the civil war was caused by you hunting the communists, even though the griffon responsible for the assassination had been shot and killed immediately. You were hunting innocents for no reason, so they rebelled."\n\nKloseu's purple eyes burned with anger, the scar on his cheek twisting as he grimaced. "How dare you? How dare you say things like that?!" He stood up and slammed his fist on the table. Tomado was startled, but quickly regained his composure.\n\n"Father, I am sorry, but I felt like I had to tell you my honest opinion. You keep trying to do things right but you keep failing and hurting our people, which only makes you worse. After the... impalements, I wasn't sure if I even wanted to call you father anymore. It's as if a changeling had taken his place. Don't you think it's time for you to step down?"\n\nHis Majesty calmed himself and sat down on his chair. He stared into nothingess silently while Tomado wiped a tear from his cheek.\n\n"You are bold, son, for speaking against your father like that. Very bold indeed. But...""
brodfeld_rework.12.a:0 ""...You are right.""
brodfeld_rework.12.b:0 "Brodfeld will reform into a constitutional monarchy!"
brodfeld_rework.12.c:0 ""...I forgive you, this time. Now begone! I have much work to do.""
brodfeld_rework.12.e:0 "Brodfeld will reform into a militaristic absolute monarchy..."

brodfeld_rework.10.t:0 "A Royal Dinner"
brodfeld_rework.10.d:0 "Today a grand banquet was held in Kivessin's Royal Palace. Visitors arrived from all over Prywhen and beyond, with members of every noble house attending along with foreign dignitaries. In addition, a surprisingly large number of military officers attended, many of whom were notable members of the Golden Guard. The King greeted everyone personally, shaking their claws as their entered, his son standing beside him. The King smiled, yet Tomado's gaze was absent and he barely spoke.\n\nThe dinner's program consisted of a six course meal, a musical performance conducted by the Wingbardian-Brodfeldian maestro Enrico Chivaldori, an hour of dancing and a five course meal. After the sun had set, the King held a speech as the guests enjoyed the finest Sicameon wine.\n\n"My dear friends! I hope you have all enjoyed my banquet. Let this be a sign to you all that a new age of bliss and prosperity has begun in Brodfeld! Indeed, if it wasn't for our brave soldiers, we would not be standing here right now. Their brave sacrifices and their determination to save our country from godless communists impress even Arcturius Himself. Therefore this feast is held in their honour! In my warriors of gold I can trust, for I know they will defend Prywhen from without and within for many years to come."\n\nKloseu's burning violet eyes were especially focused on the foreigners and the nobles.\n\n"Let he who conspires to destroy Brodfeld know that we will not give in easily! A baptism of fire have we survived and it has made us strong. Nothing shall break our Kingdom! Long live Brodfeld! Eviliana watches over us!"\n\nKloseu pounded his chest with his fist, then raised it high. When the officers in the audience saw this, they did the same and shouted "Hail Kloseu! Long live the King! Long live Brodfeld!". The other visitors appeared uncomfortable, especially the foreigners, and the Prince left the room with hasty steps."
brodfeld_rework.10.a:0 "Brodfeld shall prevail!"

brodfeld_rework.11.t:0 "A New Beginning"
brodfeld_rework.11.d:0 "The King finally appeared in public today and declared he had an announcement to make. A large, curious crowd gathered in front of his palace to hear what he had to say. When he finally came to the balcony and greeted his subjects, he was accompanied by his son Tomado.\n\n"People of Brodfeld! Long have you suffered under my rule, and at last I am willing to admit it. I am no God and am thus flawed just like any griffon, and have made many mistakes in my life. Now it is time for this to change! It is time for the people of Prywhen to control their own fate. I hereby announce that a new constitution is in effect and that Brodfeld has become a constitutional monarchy, like that of Feathisia. I will not abdicate, but my responsibilities have been greatly reduced. The senate will be expanded and its members will not be appointed by me, but elected by you. My dear people, after everything that has happened, you deserve to be free!"\n\nThe crowd stared at the King in silent shock for a moment, before some griffons cheered in jubilation and praised the King. The joy soon spread and everyone chanted "Long live the King! Eviliana bless you!"\n\nKloseu smiled and turned to his son, who was watching the celebrating crowd with teary eyes.\n\n"Thank you, son," Kloseu said and embraced him tightly."
brodfeld_rework.11.a:0 "Prywhen is truly free at last!"

brodfeld_rework.13.t:0 "Election Day"
brodfeld_rework.13.d:0 "For the first time in the long history of Prywhen, an election was held for who would govern the people, instead of the matter being decided with violence. Voter turnout was at 60% as many griffons were still hesitant about the drastic and sudden change. The most important position being filled was that of the Prime Minister, who would lead the government and have more power than the King himself.\n\nOn the day when the results of the vote were to be revealed, Prince Tomado paid a visit to his friend Enrico Chivaldori who lived in Sydia. Encouraged by Tomado and supported by his party PNL (or what remained of it after the eviction), he had reluctantly stood for nomination for the position of Prime Minister.\n\nTomado knocked on the door of his apartment, which opened after a moment. Enrico smiled when he saw Tomado and the two embraced each other. The Prince ordered his bodyguards to stay outside and went in with his friend. The two sat down together after Enrico prepared some tea.\n\n"So, what brings you to my humble abode, friend?" Enrico asked.\n"The election, of course. The results will be revealed today, and I know you're nervous about it. I came here to calm your nerves and celebrate with you when you win." He grinned, winked and sipped the tea.\nEnrico sighed. "Come on, Tom, I'm not going to win. I'm a son of a migrant from Wingbardy and a former music teacher, and I almost got kicked out of the country."\n"None of those are bad things. Prywhenians trust foreigners more than each other, having a humble civilian background makes you more relatable and my pardon has given you special attention and empathy. Not to mention the only other serious candidates are Beam Bruno and Miguel Cordona, neither of which are as popular as you."\nEnrico shook his head and drank some tea. "Maybe, I don't know. Even if I win, I'm not sure I have what it takes to run a country, especially one that has been torn by civil war.\n"Rico, don't sell yourself short. You have many great ideas and a gentle heart. You'll be a great Prime Minister." Tomado took Enrico's violin from a cabinet and gave it to him. "Play some music. I know it always calms you down."\nEnrico smiled in response, took it and began to play."
brodfeld_rework.13.a:0 "And the winner of the election is..."

brodfeld_rework.14_t_largo:0 "Largo"
brodfeld_rework.14_d_largo:0 "The halls of the Royal Palace in Kivessin, which now functioned as a parliamentary building as well, echoed with hasty steps of paws and claws as a dozen ministers and senators followed the Prime Minister, holding papers and documents and constantly asking him frantic questions. Enrico remained silent and kept walking at a brisk pace until he reached his office. He entered and slammed the door shut behind him.\n\nEnrico sighed and sat down on his chair, then quietly pondered for a while. He turned to look at his violin which was on his table.\n\nPerhaps some music would calm his nerves and help him come up with a plan.\n\nHe took the violin and, as representatives were banging on the door, began to play a slow, calm and sorrowful melody. The banging soon ended and everyone outside seemed to have gone silent.\n\nEnrico's eyes lit up. He had an idea."

brodfeld_rework.58.t:0 "Day of Judgement"
brodfeld_rework.58.d:0 "The captured leaders of GLA were the first to face trial. The King himself, along with his son Tomado, travelled to White Flower's prison camp to witness the proceedings. The suspects, in face of overwhelming evidence, were all convicted guilty of high treason and were sentenced to die. While initially they were to be hanged, His Majesty barked in anger that they deserved a harsher punishment and demanded their impalement, which shocked everyone, especially the convicts and the Prince. Kloseu himself had banned impalement some years after the Kingdom was founded, but it seems he had changed his mind about the matter since.\n\nGeneral Ion Soimescu ordered his hesitant soldiers to obey at once. While the whereabouts of the devil Filip Redglad are unknown, his second-in-command Richard Spear had been captured and was the first to be executed. Before his impalement he saluted the other convicts and said "Comrades, remember: Prywhen is not yet lost!". One by one the traitors were executed. Cynthia, Witia, Brandon, Rain, Koldvin. The last convict, Theresa, glanced at the Prince, her eyes distraught with terror. The Prince gave her a pitiful sigh in return and averted her gaze.\n\nAs soldiers carried her to the sharpened iron pike, she managed to get loose from their grasp and ran to Tomado. She fell on her knees in front of him. "I beg you, Prince, I know your father is a stranger to mercy, but surely you're better than him! I don't claim to be innocent, but I repent and beg for forgiveness! If you pardon me, I swear to never betray my country again!"\n\nIon Soimescu immediately pulled out his pistol and was ready to shoot her before Tomado stepped in front of him. He turned to his furious father and said "She genuinely regrets her actions and asks for a royal pardon. If you do not give her a chance, then I no longer wish to be an heir to such a cruel and tyrannical griffon."\n\nKloseu silently glared at his only child in both surprise and anger, his fists clenched.\n\n"Fine," he spat out. "She shall live. For now"."

brodfeld_rework.60.d.a:0 "On this day, GLA capitulated and peace was restored to Prywhen. The King had made it into a national holiday, so today a large celebration was held across the country and our subjects had a day off. Golden flags of Brodfeld were flown from public buildings in every city and town. A large military parade was held in Kivessin, Prelate Denali held a sermon in the Grand Temple of Eviliana and the King spoke about the dangers of communism and the importance of stability and unity. Afterwards there was a minute of silence to honour the fallen. The day ended with a spectacular firework display."

prywhen.4.d:0 "Blackrock and her thugs have responded to our request for help. Sadly, they do not see the urgency of the situation and refuse to help us in our struggle against the communists."
prywhen.4.a:0 "Bah, we don't need their help anyways!"

brodfeld.1.t:0 "Foreign Military Aid?"
brodfeld.1.d:0 "While none of our neighbours wish to directly intervene in the conflict which in their eyes is an internal matter, perhaps we can gain indirect aid from them. After all, if the communists win, they will spread their wicked revolution and bring ruin to their fair countries."
brodfeld.1.a:0 "Yes, send messengers to all of our neighbours!"

brodfeld.2.t:0 "Brodfeld Requests Military Aid!"
brodfeld.2.d:0 "Another request for aid arrived from Brodfeld today. They urgently ask for military aid of any kind and describe in detail what atrocities the communists have committed, saying they must be stopped at all costs. They also say that if the red revolution succeeds, it will spread like cancer to us as well. Should we assist the King?"
brodfeld.2.a:0 "Send support! The reds must be stopped!"
brodfeld.2.b:0 "It's their problem."

brodfeld.3.t:0 "Foreign Military Advisors Arrive!"
brodfeld.3.d:0 "Foreign advisors and volunteers have arrived to support us! The advisors are veterans with extensive knowledge of tacticts and strategy while the volunteers are eager to fight for our cause. We stand united against the Red Menace which seeks to undo all that we hold dear."
brodfeld.3.a:0 "Great!"

brodfeld.3.t_not_arrived:0 "No One Sent Aid!"
brodfeld.3.d_not_arrived:0 "Out of all our neighbours, nobody provided any help to us! They are too foolish to recognize the threat posed by Redglad's bandits."
brodfeld.3.b:0 "All of you will regret this!"

brodfeld.4.t:0 "Foreign Economic Aid?"
brodfeld.4.d:0 "One of our few advantages over the communists in the war is our control of the two major cities in Prywhen, Sydia and Kivessin. Yet we are unable to fully tap into this industrial potential, for our economy has crumbled and we lack the funds to support our industry. We will now ask our neighbours to provide economic aid, emphasizing that it will help the suffering people of Prywhen. This is not a lie, of course, but it will also help with the war effort."
brodfeld.4.a:0 "The telegraph wires will be busy tonight..."

brodfeld.5.t:0 "Brodfeld Requests Economical Help"
brodfeld.5.d:0 "The Kingdom of Brodfeld is fighting a bloody civil war against communist peasant rebels. The leaders of the Kingdom beg us to help the suffering economy of the country, which has been almost completely devastated by the conflict and has left thousands languishing in poverty."
brodfeld.5.a:0 "Of course! We must help the poor griffons!"
brodfeld.5.b:0 "They just want help against the rebels, don't they..."

brodfeld.6.t:0 "Foreign Economic Aid Arrives!"
brodfeld.6.d:0 "Today we have thankfully received funds from abroad, brought by heavily guarded ships and caravans. We must invest these coins in our industry and hire more workers and researchers to our civilian and military factories."
brodfeld.6.a:0 "The King will be in debt... of gratitude!"

brodfeld.6.t_not_arrived:0 "No One Sent Money!"
brodfeld.6.d_not_arrived:0 "It seems even trying to evoke pity did not help, for our neighbours refuse to send any funds to us."
brodfeld.6.b:0 "You greedy bastards!"

brodfeld.7.t:0 "Marsh Warbands"
brodfeld.7.d:0 "The Terrible Marsh is a desolate and cursed wasteland inhabited by few. Even before the war our control of the region was tenuous, limited to the rich oilfields in the outskirts of the swamps. We know that tribes of savages inhabit the magical, beast-infested marshes, and while they are backwards, they could still help us with the war.\n\nTherefore we sent a squad to sail along the Evi river and try to contact these tribes, and it seems they were successful. Tribal warbands have emerged from the marshes, armed with muskets our soldiers had brought them, ready to kill everything in sight. This will certainly be a surprise for the red filth!"
brodfeld.7.a:0 "Excellent! Promote everyone in that squad."

brodfeld.8.t:0 "Operation: Boiled Rice"
brodfeld.8.d:0 "While we are beginning to run out of food, so is our cursed enemy. To win the war, it will be necessary to sabotage their ricefields so their next harvest will fail miserably! Infiltrators have been sent to arm and organize local peasants, who are furious about the communists' confiscation of their private farms. Together, they will begin a campaign of sabotage and terror, burning down the new property of GLA and forcing them to divert troops away from the frontline. This might be just what we need to turn the tide of the war!"
brodfeld.8.a:0 "The bastards won't be having any boiled rice next winter."

brodfeld.10.t:0 "Foreign Engineers?"
brodfeld.10.d:0 "After several years of brain-drain we lack educated engineers. Without them, our industry does not operate at full capacity. Any engineers of ours who fled the country will certainly not return until the war is over, so perhaps we should attempt to replace them with foreign ones. Out of all the nearby nations, only the Kingdom of Griffonstone and the Free Towns of Gryphus are civilized enough to have spare engineers, so we should send messages to them."
brodfeld.10.a:0 "Let us hope their answer will be positive."

brodfeld.11.t:0 "Brodfeld Requests Our Engineers!"
brodfeld.11.d:0 "A message has arrived from Kivessin, requesting the help of our talented engineers. They would assist with their civilian economy only and return once the conflict has ended and Brodfeld's own refugee engineers come back home."
brodfeld.11.a:0 "Seems like a reasonable request."
brodfeld.11.a:0 "We will not send our most talented minds to a war zone!"

brodfeld.12.t:0 "Foreign Engineers Arrive!"
brodfeld.12.d:0 "After a long trip, foreign engineers have arrived in Sydia, eager to work for us and aid our ailing industrial sector. Their expertise will be a boon to our war effort!"
brodfeld.12.a:0 "Thank you Griffonstone!"
brodfeld.12.b:0 "Thank you Gryphus!"
brodfeld.12.c:0 "Thank you both!"

brodfeld.12.t_not_arrived:0 "No Engineers For Us..."
brodfeld.12.d_not_arrived:0 "The responses, sadly, were both negative. Neither Griffonstone nor Gryphus wish to send their engineers to us, stating that it is too dangerous for them to go to a country embroiled in a civil war. They are not wrong, of course, for that is the reason our own engineers left..."
brodfeld.12.e:0 "Curse them both!"

brodfeld.13.t:0 "Tank Quest!"
brodfeld.13.d:0 "There are rumours that the Skyfall Trade Federation purchased several armoured mechanical beasts from ponyland over the ocean. Those machines spit fire and can drive on their own. Their government recently constructed a military factory and started manufacturing the magical creations in secret, away from the public eye. Luckily, one of the federal officials spilled the beans to our prince's mother-in-law, who is a daughter of burgmeister of Fezera and was visiting Skyfall. We should embark a party for the journey and sail west to acquire on of the few models. This might as well be the key to our victory in the civil war. The speed of the operation and reliance of the pirate ship crew that we managed to hire, as they were the only ones willing to do the mission, will depend on the amount of pay."
brodfeld.13.a:0 "Let them feel like kings!"
brodfeld.13.b:0 "Buy them rum!"
brodfeld.13.c:0 "We can't give them much."
brodfeld.13.e:0 "For our ancestors' sake, we can't waste time on nonsense!"

brodfeld.14.t:0 "The Tank Has Arrived!"
brodfeld.14.d:0 "The journey ended and the pirates kept their word, they didn't run away with the money. What's more important, they brought back a present for us! We shall organise a new division and push the beast to battle! Let the miracle weapon lead us to victory!"
brodfeld.14.a:0 "Hurraah!"

#Likely no longer used
brodfeld.15.t:0 "The Civil War Is Over!"
brodfeld.15.d:0 "Since the last communist forces have capitulated, we are ready to begin our rehabilitation."
brodfeld.15.a:0 "Great."

brodfeld.21.t:0 "The Civil War Is Over!"
brodfeld.21.d:0 "After a long struggle, the civil war has at last come to an end. Yet the suffering continues, for our once fair and beautiful country lies in ruin. Food prices are sky-high, trade has come to a halt and the infrastructure is badly damaged. Now we must rebuild and recover, as well as punish the scum responsible for the devastation."
brodfeld.21.a:0 "Brodfeld shall prevail!"

brodfeld.22.t:0 "Peasants of Prywhen!"
brodfeld.22.d:0 "Soldiers went out to villages and towns across Prywhen, gathered the locals and read out loud the following message, written by the King himself:\n\n"Hear my plea! I call to you to defend your homeland from the traitors that have been ravaging this land for years! These brutes wish to take away your precious farmland and give it to vile robbers and peddlers, all in the name of equality. They seek to undo the natural order of the world, for in their eyes all are equal. They say you, hard-working and proud peasants of Prywhen, are as lowly as your ignorant young sons, cruel bandits in the woods and lazy beggars in the towns. Do you wish to live in such a society? Or will you stand with me against this insanity? You, my dear subjects, shall be enlisted in the royal army of Brodfeld! Today!"\n\nThousands of griffons cheered enthusiastically, yet thousands of others remained silent, fear in their eyes. What should we do?"
brodfeld.22.a:0 "Conscript as many as possible!"
brodfeld.22.b:0 "Don't conscript too many."
brodfeld.22.c:0 "A thousand is enough."

brodfeld.23.t:0 "Peasants of Kivessin!"
brodfeld.23.d:0 "Soldiers travelled to villages near the capital, gathered local peasants and read out loud the following message, written by the King himself:\n\n"Hear my plea! You worked hard on the fields around the capital for many years! You fed yourself, the lord and the royal family. Now, you have a chance to defend your land, defend your kin and the king, who is sweating it right out to care about you! The red bandits are coming. They are going to slaughter you, burn your villages and steal your lands. Do not let them do this! To arms!"\n\nHundreds of peasants eagerly shouted "Long Live the King!", yet hundreds of others said nothing, doubt in their eyes. What should we do?"

brodfeld.24.t:0 "Peasants of Sydia!"
brodfeld.24.d:0 "Soldiers travelled to villages near Sydia, gathered local peasants and read out loud the following message, written by the King himself:\n\n"Hear my plea! The fish that you bring us enriched the tables of the people of Prywhen for many years! The crops that you cultivate under the warm southern sun brought cheer and happiness to every loyal subject of mine. Beware now, as the red bandits are approaching this land, there will be no joy anymore. Their claws will take away your land, your food, your shelters. Join the royal army now! That is the only way to stop them!"\n\nHundreds of peasants chanted "Death to Redglad! Death to Communists!" while waving their pitchforks, yet hundreds of others remained quiet, terror in their eyes. What should we do?"
