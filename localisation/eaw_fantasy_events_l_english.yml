 fantasyflavor.1.t:0 "Terror In The Countryside"
 fantasyflavor.1.d:0 "Attacks by monstrous beasts are nothing unusual in the countryside, and hardy farmers have no choice but to get used to it. Usually, monsters are driven off or killed as soon as they are seen, and sometimes they manage to injure or even kill a farmer or two. But worryingly, news have arrived in the capital of something much worse.\n\nWord has spread of a terrifying monster preying on lone individuals, mothers and even the young. It attacks, kills and feasts on flesh before disappearing into the night. There have been an alarmingly high number of such attacks reported in a small area. The local farmers are mortified, and their attempts to find the beast have been in vain. As casualties are mounting, they have now petitioned the government for aid.\n\nThe story of this beast is becoming popular, and many citizens now look to us, expecting us to help the poor farmers. While this originated as a local issue, it has now gained attention across the country. If we do nothing, the populace will be disappointed."
 fantasyflavor.1.a:0 "We'll do what we can to help."
 fantasyflavor.1.b:0 "The farmers can handle it themselves, surely."
 
 fantasyflavor.2.t:0 "The Beast Eludes Us"
 fantasyflavor.2.d:0 "After the petition for aid, we decided to hire the finest hunters in the land to go and slay the foul beast. However, in their latest report, the hunters say that they have failed to find the beast, as it leaves no tracks behind. Attacks on vulnerable farmers have continued and some are locking themselves inside their homes, refusing to even go outside.\n\nSpeculation has been rife across the country about the beast. Some say it is a Chimera, an Ophiotaurus or a Manticore, while others claim it might be a Bugbear, a Roc or even a fearsome Dragon. If the beast can fly, it would explain the lack of tracks. Intellectuals claim that it is merely a hungry wolf, nothing more.\n\nThe hunters are requesting more aid, and are even proposing a large-scale thorough sweep of the area by hundreds of armed persons. It would be an expensive operation, and some in the government are reminding us of the sunk cost fallacy and say we should just give up, though this would greatly harm our reputation."
 fantasyflavor.2.a:0 "Send in the army!"
 fantasyflavor.2.b:0 "This is a waste of time."
 
 fantasyflavor.3.t:0 "The Beast Is Slain!"
 fantasyflavor.3.d:0 "After we sent 2500 soldiers to help the hunters, the area was searched thoroughly and any possible hiding places of the beast were torn down. As the area was surrounded, the beast could not escape on land, and sentries were positioned to guard the skies day and night, preventing it from flying away.\n\nAs the operation was nearing its conclusion, the beast was finally found and slain. Or well, it was a group of beasts. The hunters identified them as Pukwudgies, small, colourful and spiked creatures with large, fanged mouths, resembling porcupines in appearance. Their size explains the lack of tracks and their large number explains the number of attacks. According to the soldiers, all such beasts in the area have been exterminated, and the farmers should be safe.\n\nThe public is pleased, yet also disappointed. The beast seemed far more threatening when it was an unknown danger. When it was revealed to be a pack of small hungry pukwudgies, some even expressed sympathy for them, thinking they were simply trying to survive, and that they could've been captured easily instead of being killed."
 fantasyflavor.3.a:0 "Well, it's finally over."
 
 fantasyflavor.4.t:0 "The Beast Is Slain, Again"
 fantasyflavor.4.d:0 "After the pukwudgies were exterminated, the hunters and the soldiers left the area, and the farmers returned to their normal, routine lives.\n\nOr so they thought.\n\nOnly a few days after the sweeping operation, the beast attacks continued like before. The farmers were terrified, yet knew that the government was unlikely to help a second time, and that the public didn't care about them now that the danger had been officially declared to be over. So they decided to deal with the beast themselves, acquiring weapons and making sure no one was ever alone in the wild.\n\nEventually, one group of farmers was attacked when it was dark, but they were carrying a torch. It was thrown at the beast which burst into flames and perished. The charred remains of the creature were presented to the local governor, who then showed it to a cryptozoologist. They identified the beast as a rogue Timberwolf, a wolf-like creature made of twigs, logs and branches. They are rare outside of the Everfree Forest, but have been spotted elsewhere on occasion. Due to their lightweight body, they leave no tracks.\n\nAfter the incident, the beast attacks ended for good, and the area returned to peace and tranquility."
