 klugetown.1.t:0 "Retirement"
 klugetown.1.d:0 "Verko sat in his office, puffing a cigar. It was a very nice office, really. Redwood from the Changeling coast tiling the floor, with luxurious Colthagian leather upholstering his chair. He'd be sad to see it go, but a peaceful retirement was be better than the alternative. Better than getting bumped off by Charlie, for sure.\n\nA knock at the door jolted him out of his ponderings. "Come in," he called over. Quick Buck entered, a curious look on her face. "What is it, sir? You said you wanted to see me as soon as possible?"\n\nVerko nodded. "Quick Buck, my girl, you've done quite well for yourself. You've become quite the rising star in my organization, and I believe it's time." He looked out the window over the ramshackle slums that defined Klugetown. "I think you're ready for the next step. I'm getting old, and I need someone to help out. Your work in your forgery shows you're a subtle, cunning type. Exactly what this town needs."\n\nQuick Buck grinned. "I'm glad you think so, sir. What's my new job?"\n\nVerko leaned back in his chair. "Mine. I need you to run Klugetown when I retire, which should be within the week."\n\nHer eyes went wide. "You're retiring? Now?" A quick nod answered her question. "Understood, sir. Is there anything I can get you before you leave?"\n\n"A passport into Skyfall?" Verko asked with a chuckle. "I'd rather not deal with Boss Charlie."\n\n"Definitely." As Verko stood up, she shook his paw. "I'll do you proud, sir.""

 # IDEAS #
 KLG_trading_hub:0 "The Black Market of the White Sands"
 KLG_trading_hub_desc:0 "In Klugetown, anything can be bought for the right price. From exotic drugs to organ transplants, from debt-slaves to forged papers, Klugetown offers services most other nations deem immoral if not outright illegal."
 KLG_mafia_rule:0 "The Mafia in Charge"
 KLG_mafia_rule_desc:0 "In Klugetown, organized crime has completely supplanted the normal state, to the point that unhappy citizens turn to the crime bosses for recourse. Their rule has kept Klugetown stable for decades, and they don't take kindly to conquerors seizing their land."

 # LEADERS #
 POLITICS_VERKO_DESC:0 "A clever criminal and entrepeneur who has ruled Klugetown for over 20 years, Verko kept Klugetown in business even during the Storm King's rule. With a strict code of honor and a talent for bargaining, Verko is widely respected and feared. He's getting old, though, and it's only a matter of time before he retires or someone retires him."
 POLITICS_CHARLIE_DESC:0 ""So ya wanna hear about Boss Charlie, pal? Well, the story goes like this. Young Diamond Mountain pup lookin' for a quick profit cons the wrong dog and is sent to a life in the mines. Lil' Charlie's scared outta his fur, but he hatches a plan. See, the overseer always has lunch in the same spot. So Charlie sneaks out one night to do a bit of extra minin'. After a week, when the overseer goes to get a bite to eat, the ceiling crushes him into the dirt. In the chaos, Charlie sneaks out, and makes a break for Bakara. With a bit of throat-slittin', he scrounges up enough cash to charter a trip to Zebrica, where there's plenty of money to be made. Now with Verko outta the way and Capper put in his place, I run this town. And ya best mind your manners, cause I intend to turn this dump into the richest town in the world, and it don't matter to me who has to bleed to get there.""
 POLITICS_CAPPER_DESC:0 "Capper has spent most of his life on the run. Growing up an orphan, he had to steal to eat. He wound up a low-level concat in Verko's employ. After meeting the Elements of Harmony, Capper reformed, and now pushes for a free Klugetown that can serve as a haven to the oppressed or persecuted, where freedom and Harmony are loved in equal measure—a Kása of the South."
 POLITICS_QUICKBUCK_DESC:0 "Quick Buck was born in Klugetown and has spent most of her life here. Making a killing as a forger, she was a natural choice for Verko's successor. With a bright mind and a drive to see Klugetown fully modernized, she's certainly not lacking goals. Her quick rise has earned her her fair share of enemies, however, and only time will tell if she'll be able to navigate the treacherous waters of Klugetown politics as Verko did."
