 NE_strengthen_the_army:0 "The Return Of Tambelon"
 NE_strengthen_the_army_desc:0 "The Bell has been rung and the banishment has been undone. Tambelon has returned, and so has the Father. Soon, the rule of the goats shall return as well. This marks the beginning of a new era. The Ouroboros rotates once again."
 NE_rally_troops:0 "Flesh And Bone"
 NE_rally_troops_desc:0 "Goats ruled the world with the might of amalgamated monsters, made by binding the flesh of various animals into superior constructs. The cages and laboratories of Tambelon still hold many of such creatures. Yet more monsters need to be made, to rebuild the might of goatkind..."
 NE_recruit_spies:0 "The All-Seeing Eye"
 NE_recruit_spies_desc:0 "Now that Grogar is once more in possession of his crystal ball, nothing can be hidden from Him. The sphere sees all there is. His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth, and flesh."
 NE_forced_labour:0 "Crack The Whip"
 NE_forced_labour_desc:0 "Over the centuries, other races such as zebras and camels have settled the desolate lands of former Tambelon. They seem to have forgotten their distant past as slaves of goatkind. They shall receive a grim reminder of their true purpose."
 NE_heavy_units:0 "Awaken The Titan"
 NE_heavy_units_desc:0 "Before there was time, before there was anything, there was nothing. And before there was nothing, there were monsters. Only one has survived this primordial age, tamed by Grogar to be the guardian of Tambelon. Ever since the banishment, it has slept beneath the sands, yet now it shall be awakened."
 
 NE_hire_generals:0 "The Slave-Soldiers Of Darkness"
 NE_hire_generals_desc:0 "During His exile to the Realm of Darkness, Grogar enslaved a barbaric race known as Troggles. These savages have proven themselves to be capable warriors, yet are too weak-willed to rebel against their new masters. Grogar is in need of loyal servants to command his monsters, so the Troggles shall fulfill this duty."
 NE_airforce_expansion:0 "When Pigs Fly"
 NE_airforce_expansion_desc:0 "Goats cannot fly and have no desire to do so. In the past, they gifted this ability to some of their creations to fight against inferior races capable of flight. But those races have now developed winged monstrosities of metal to rule the skies. A new kind of creature must be designed to counter this crude mockery."
 NE_crystal_mining:0 "Secure A Source Of Crystals"
 NE_crystal_mining_desc:0 "Before the banishment, slaves mined crystals used to store magical energy. As the end neared, these mines were then seized by the former slaves, who failed to utilize crystals to their full potential. Goats will put them to far better use: Crystal-infused armour will protect monsters from the pathetic "weapons" of savages."
 NE_magical_experiment:0 "Might And Magic"
 NE_magical_experiment_desc:0 "Now that a new generation of biomancers is being trained, goats shall regain their position as the mightiest mages the world has ever known. Great biomantic spells can be cast upon the enemy, to break their resolve and their bodies."
