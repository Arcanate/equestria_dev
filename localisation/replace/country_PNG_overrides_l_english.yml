 NE_strengthen_the_army_desc:0 "The Bell has been rung and the banishment has been undone. Tambelon has returned, and so has the Father. Soon, the rule of the goats shall return as well. This marks the beginning of a new era. The Ouroboros rotates once again."
 NE_rally_troops:0 "Flesh And Bone"
 NE_rally_troops_desc:0 "Goats ruled the world with the might of amalgamated monsters, made by binding the flesh of various animals into superior constructs. The cages and laboratories of Tambelon still hold many of such creatures. Yet more monsters need to be made, to rebuild the might of goatkind..."

 NE_hire_generals:0 "The Slave-Soldiers Of Darkness"
 NE_hire_generals_desc:0 "During His exile to the Realm of Darkness, Grogar enslaved a barbaric race known as Troggles. These savages have proven themselves to be capable warriors, yet are too weak-willed to rebel against their new masters. Grogar is in need of loyal servants to command his monsters, so the Troggles shall fulfill this duty."
