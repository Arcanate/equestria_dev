ASS_DONKEY_DESC:0 "§gBray is the most faithful servant of Grogar, and the architect of his return. He is an Asstyrian donkey who was born as a lowly commoner. Much of his adult life was spent as a caravan guard, but everything changed when he discovered a crystal ball buried in the sands of Zebhara.\n\nThe sphere observed him and influenced him, learning about him as he carried it along. Bray was unable to resist its magical power, so he became attached to the ball and hid it from others. Soon enough, Grogar contacted him through it as he needed a loyal servant to aid with the summoning ritual.\n\nBray followed the instructions closely and allowed himself to become a mere extension of Grogar's will. Whatever personality he once had is now gone, and he is nothing more than a obedient puppet of flesh and bone.§!"

biomancy_decisions_desc:0 "Biomancy as an art has been forgotten by the disgusting lesser races, and even the goats have to relearn its secrets. Yet the Overgoat remembers. He is the greatest teacher one could pray to have. In His presence, there are no such things as secrets.\n\nCurrently, we have §C[?ouroboros]§! units of living biomass."
WIT_make_manticores_desc:0 "Manticores are medium-sized creatures. The template is primarily based on a lion, with the addition of leathery wings, sensitive bat ears and a large scorpion tail. They have oversized paws for improved close combat efficiency. The wings allow it to rapidly approach enemies, and its large mouth allows it to swallow smaller creatures whole. Its sting is highly venomous, capable of killing the victim within seconds."
WIT_make_chimeras_desc:0 "Chimeras are medium-sized creatures. They are one of the oldest creatures designed by goatkind, being a shining example of biomantic amalgamation. The frontal section comes from a saber-toothed tiger, the rear section comes from a goat, and the tail is constructed out of a snake. Therefore the chimera has three heads, allowing it greater vision and cognitive power. The inclusion of a goat's head means the creature is fully sapient. Furthermore, it is enhanced with an ability to breathe fire, a feature made possible thanks to close study of dragon cadavers. The only notable design flaw of the creature is the fact that its three heads sometimes fail to cooperate."
WIT_make_hydras_desc:0 "Hydras are large creatures. The design of the template is based on dragons, the enemies of goatkind. It is a reptilian creature that has four heads with elongated necks and sharp snapping jaws. The creature also has abilities of rapid regeneration, enabling it to regrow lost heads and other body parts. It lacks the ability to fly like a dragon, but instead is designed to use methods of ambush to surprise the foe. Marshes with their murky water are ideal hiding places for a hydra. Like with the chimera, the heads do not always work together. It was the last and greatest example of multi-headed creature design."
WIT_make_pigs_desc:0 "Flying pigs are small creatures. The template is an upgraded version of an older, pre-banishment design developed to fight against flying races. The original design was abandoned for being too ineffective, but the new one is specifically developed to counter aircraft. The template is simple, merging avian wings into a pig. It is too small and agile to be easily hit by large flying machines, and its enhanced metal-piercing tusks and hooves can cause significant damage to planes. Nevertheless, the flying pigs are primarily effective in large numbers due to their size and lack of ranged offensive abilities."
WIT_train_biomancers_desc:0 "Grogar cannot yet be everywhere at once, so lesser goat biomancers are needed on the field to heal damaged creatures and maintain control over them. However, being on the frontline is a dangerous duty. Because most goats have forgotten their abilities, the only way to replenish casualties is by training them to become biomancers. It takes time, and apprentices need an ample supply of biomass for practice, but it is the only way to restore the ancient knowledge of the goats."
WIT_multiply_biomass_desc:0 "Units of biomass have the natural ability to reproduce. Through biomantic acceleration, the growth speed of new units can be greatly increased, even if it is a painful experience for the targets. While inefficient, it remains the most reliable method of producing additional units of biomass."

biomancy_decisions_2_desc:0 "Biomancy can be used for more than merely the artistry of the flesh. It can be used as a weapon against the savage, lesser races. Their bodies will bend to the will of Grogar, or they will break.\n\nCurrently, we have enough magical power to cast §C[?magical_power]§! spells.\n\nCurrent §LFear Factor§! is [Root.fear_factor_dynamic_loc]."
WIT_cancer_desc:0 "Cancer cells appear naturally in the bodies of living beings, and the immune system usually eliminate them. However, with biomancy it is possible to cause increased cellular malfunctions to overwhelm the immune systems of the targets. The tumours will then slowly but surely terminate their life functions. It is a relatively ineffective spell, yet spreads widespread terror among the targets due to the negative reputation of the disease."
