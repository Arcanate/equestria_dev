biomancy_decisions_desc:0 "Biomancy as an art has been forgotten by the disgusting lesser races, and even the goats have to relearn its secrets. Yet the Overgoat remembers. He is the greatest teacher one could pray to have. In His presence, there are no such things as secrets.\n\nCurrently, we have §C[?ouroboros]§! units of living biomass."
WIT_make_manticores_desc:0 "Manticores are medium-sized creatures. The template is primarily based on a lion, with the addition of leathery wings, sensitive bat ears and a large scorpion tail. They have oversized paws for improved close combat efficiency. The wings allow it to rapidly approach enemies, and its large mouth allows it to swallow smaller creatures whole. Its sting is highly venomous, capable of killing the victim within seconds."
WIT_train_biomancers_desc:0 "Grogar cannot yet be everywhere at once, so lesser goat biomancers are needed on the field to heal damaged creatures and maintain control over them. However, being on the frontline is a dangerous duty. Because most goats have forgotten their abilities, the only way to replenish casualties is by training them to become biomancers."
WIT_multiply_biomass_desc:0 "Units of biomass have the natural ability to reproduce. Through biomantic acceleration, the growth speed of new units can be greatly increased, even if it is a painful experience for the targets. While inefficient, it remains the most reliable method of producing additional units of biomass."
