 submarine_1:0 "Early Submarine"
 submarine_1_desc:0 "Submarines are stealthy vessels designed to take out undefended convoys. The early models from the Great War pave the way for new methods of naval warfare."
 submarine_2:0 "1007 Submarine"
 submarine_2_desc:0 "Better armed and more stable, new submarine designs are made to take advantage of advancements in naval tactics and have longer range, being able to attack distant convoy routes."
 submarine_3:0 "1011 Submarine"
 submarine_3_desc:0 "The role of the submarine in the fleet outside of convoy attacks is still under debate. Achieving a balance between combination of speed, range and weaponry will be key to the necessary model."
 submarine_4:0 "1015 Submarine"
 submarine_4_desc:0 "Increased test depth and efficient layouts will be features of the modern submarines, taking advantage of field experience to select appropriate armaments and engines."

 destroyer_1:0 "Torpedo Boat Destroyer"
 destroyer_1_desc:0 "The prevalence of nimble and hard-hitting torpedo boats threatens larger warships to the point where a dedicated ship class, the torpedo boat 'destroyer', can defeat enemy torpedo boats and supplant them. Larger than traditional corvettes and frigates yet smaller than cruisers, destroyers are an excellent light escort and screen."
 destroyer_2:0 "Enlarged Destroyer"
 destroyer_2_desc:0 "Previous destroyer designs were fairly restrictive in overall displacement, which reduced their operational range and weapon mounts. Approaching the size of smaller, older cruisers, even up to 2500 tons of displacement, these new destroyers can mount far many more torpedo launchers, larger calibre guns, and dedicated hydrophone stations and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) equipment."
 destroyer_3:0 "Hunter-Killer Destroyer"
 destroyer_3_desc:0 "The growing threat from enemy submersibles has cemented the destroyer as the dedicated anti-submarine ship. Though smaller and cheaper corvettes are adequate at escorting merchant shipping, the best way to protect ourselves from submarines is by actively hunting them. Destroyers fitted with improved sonar and radar can immediately locate enemy submarines, and destroy them with forward-launched ASW weapons."
 destroyer_4:0 "Battle Destroyer"
 destroyer_4_desc:0 "Destroyers are fragile warships compared to cruisers or larger capital ships, so their staying power during battle is limited. Though fast and evasive, we shouldn't expect them to dodge enemy fire and torpedoes indefinitely. As such, these new designs, better compartmentalised and utilising dual-purpose main armament to allow further torpedo launcher mounts, can deal out far more damage than ever before."
 
 light_cruiser_1:0 "Scout Cruiser"
 light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Unlike previous cruiser designs such as torpedo cruisers, the scout cruiser design was considerably reduced in overall size and displacement, making it essentially a large destroyer. These cruisers can act as flotilla leaders and are relatively well-armed to engage smaller ships while capable of launching devastating torpedo strikes when armed with torpedo tubes."
 light_cruiser_2:0 "Escort Cruiser"
 light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Built to have a greater operational range than older cruisers, escort cruisers are suitably armoured and armed to protect commerce shipping from destroyer and torpedo boat raids. Additionally, with the advent of smoke floats, escort cruisers also provide crucial fleet support to larger ships, taking on the roles that other ships are unsuited for."
 light_cruiser_3:0 "Anti-Aircraft Cruiser"
 light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The subsequent rise of torpedo and naval bombers poses a massive risk to our naval ships. Though most ships can mount additional anti-aircraft batteries, their mounting is generally wasted displacement on most other classes. Light cruisers are the best platform to turn into floating anti-aircraft batteries to protect the fleets that they're attached to. Anti-aircraft cruisers screens aren't impenetrable but will give pause to any enemy pilot."
 light_cruiser_4:0 "Dedicated Escort Cruiser"
 light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The tactical role of light cruisers has crystallised to that of a screening force against destroyers and enemy aircraft.  To reflect this, anew designs liberally employ dual-purpose main armaments to free up available displacement for either more armour, additional guns, or even larger engines. These cruisers can still fulfil scouting and shore bombardment roles, but their place is by the side of vulnerable ships."

 heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Late Armoured Cruiser"
 heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "With the introduction of large-calibre armour-piercing shells, previous ironclad and steam warships necessitated massive up-armouring. The advent of face-hardened armour offered an effective solution to fit additional protection with considerably less weight than previous types. The introduction of a belt armour of thick steel plating protects this evolved form of the 'ship of the line'."
 heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Upgunned Cruiser"
 heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Heavy cruisers are the mainstay of most fleets. However, new well-armoured vessels such as other cruisers and battleships pose a danger to heavy cruisers. Modern designs with higher calibre armaments make our heavier cruisers capable of overmatching enemy cruisers and even go up against battleships. They don't boast the biggest guns or thickest armour, but these cruisers can both deal and take plenty of damage in naval engagements."
 heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Commerce Raider Cruiser"
 heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Heavy cruisers are capable enough to act as a chiefly independent ship that, if given the opportunity, can wreak havoc upon enemy shipping lines. Strong enough to fight off and sink the typical destroyer and light cruiser escorts, modern commerce raiders are powerful vessels that are fast enough to avoid battleships. These heavy cruisers are still more than suitable to participate in large surface engagements but far more versatile."
 heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Cruiser Killer"
 heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Aircraft are a growing menace against larger ships. Though we can and should equip our heavy cruisers with better anti-aircraft defences, they should be refined to eliminate the enemy's cruiser screens. This would reduce the enemy's anti-aircraft shield and offer more and better strike opportunities for our own aircraft. As such, these 'cruiser killers' are designed accordingly with improved engines, more accurate weaponry, and better protective schemes."

 battle_cruiser_1:0 "Early Battlecruiser"
 battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The recent battlecruiser arms race resulted in several heavily armed designs, sacrificing armor for speed compared to battleships."
 battle_cruiser_2:0 "1011 Battlecruiser"
 battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Rebuilt and repurposed battlecruisers continue to outrun even modern battleship designs by lighter protection, but have developed better systems for fire control, detection and aerial defenses."

 battleship_1:0 "Late Dreadnought"
 battleship_1_desc:0 "An improved and refined version of the original Macawian Dreadnought design, this new form of the battleship utilises superimposed main turrets to vastly increase firepower while maintaining hull stability. Secondary batteries of casemates supplement the battleship to defend it against lightly armoured vessels. However, some ship designers are experimenting with turreted secondaries to save on space and improve their firing arcs."
 battleship_2:0 "Long-Range Battleship"
 battleship_2_desc:0 "Battleships are a powerful statement of a country's hard power, and they can exert it well beyond national waters. However, as the world grows ever smaller metaphorically, it becomes evident that our massive warships must have as extensive a range as possible to respond against distant threats. Streamlined designs with more efficient hulls, engines, and, of course, heavier armaments make our battleships more dangerous."
 battleship_3:0 "Radar Battleship"
 battleship_3_desc:0 "Innovations in radar technology have miniaturised radar arrays to the point that we can mount on ships, and our battleships, being the largest of our vessels, have the largest radar arrays. This device not only allows battleships to find and locate enemy vessels more reliably than search aircraft but also for them to fire from beyond sight. With such massive calibres, battleship guns can now engage targets beyond the horizon."
 battleship_4:0 "'Fortress' Battleship"
 battleship_4_desc:0 "The growing threat of airstrikes and carriers is forcing our designers to rethink the role of battleships. They are too slow and sluggish to escape attacks from aircraft, and their size makes battleships an enticing target. For now, adding a plethora of anti-aircraft weapons will dissuade most attackers. Despite this, the battleship remains a fearsome warship and the latest ones are bristling with heavy artillery, making them veritable floating fortresses."
 battleship_5:0 "Early Magical Battleship"
 battleship_6:0 "Modern Magical Battleship"

 carrier_1:0 "Early Carrier"
 carrier_1_desc:0 "Many military theorists believe that naval aviation is the future. Converting old capital ships and ocean liners to carry aircraft will be the first step towards utilizing these new doctrines."
 carrier_2:0 "1007 Carrier"
 carrier_2_desc:0 "As work begins on the first keel-up carrier designs, we must ensure that these ships have the range and speed to keep up with the rest of our navy."
 carrier_3:0 "1011 Carrier"
 carrier_3_desc:0 "Improved construction methods and more specialized systems like deck edge elevators allow these carriers to transport more planes more efficiently."
 carrier_4:0 "1015 Carrier"
 carrier_4_desc:0 "With many naval treaties now increasingly ignored, we can proceed to build carriers capable of transporting more planes than ever to secure air superiority cover."
 carrier_5:0 "Semi-Modern Carrier"
 carrier_6:0 "Modern Carrier"

 SH_battleship_1:0 "Battleship Killer"
 SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "We can focus entirely on creating the heaviest, most well-armed battleships of all time, able to engage multiple lesser vessels."
 SH_battleship_2:0 "1015 Super-Heavy Battleship"
 SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "An improvement on our earlier super heavy design with stronger weapons and improved fire control systems."

 ship_hull_cruiser_panzerschiff:0 "Pocket Battleship" 
 ship_hull_cruiser_panzerschiff_desc:0 "In an attempt to do the impossible, engineers succeeded in mating battleship-level armament with a cruiser hull. The result is a ship that outguns any other known cruiser, but which is also expensive, comparatively slow and relatively poorly armored."
 ship_hull_cruiser_coastal_defense_ship_desc:1 "An older design decades past, coastal defense ships combine the guns of a battleship with the hull of a cruiser, resulting in a powerful, but slow, cruiser, aimed at deterrence and local defense."
 ship_hull_cruiser_submarine_desc:0 "These larger submarines can patrol a longer range and hold more firepower or support equipment than their smaller cousins. However, their vulnerability and expense is making them obsolete."

 ship_heavy_battery_1_desc:0 "A large-caliber cannon dating from before the fall of the Griffonian Empire."

 # Ship Hulls #
 ship_hull_submarine:0 "Early Coastal Submarine Hull"
 ship_hull_submarine_desc:0 "A far cry from the crude war-submersibles of times past, the coastal is more capable than ever before and can threaten even the biggest ship for a very moderate cost."
 ship_hull_submarine_1:1 "Early Submarine Hull"
 ship_hull_submarine_1_desc:0 "Submarines are stealthy vessels designed to take out undefended convoys. The early models from the Great War pave the way for new methods of naval warfare."

 ship_hull_light_1:2 "Torpedo Boat Destroyer Hull"
 ship_hull_light_1_desc:0 "To ensure the safety of convoys, destroyers must be developed. Arming vessels with more torpedoes will allow more opportunities to engage."
 ship_hull_light_2:2 "1007 Destroyer Hull"
 ship_hull_light_2_desc:0 "Longer torpedo range and faster reload speeds, along with new types of armaments such as anti-air turrets, will allow our destroyers to remain efficient and versatile."
 ship_hull_light_3:2 "1011 Destroyer Hull"
 ship_hull_light_3_desc:0 "To better face threats from above and below, new destroyers must be outfitted with radar and modern anti-air and anti-submarine weaponry."
 ship_hull_light_4:2 "1015 Destroyer Hull"
 ship_hull_light_4_desc:0 "The modern destroyer must be fitted with a variety of different detection technologies, new depth charge deployment systems and be built at a larger scale than their predecessors."
 
 ship_hull_cruiser_1:1 "Early Cruiser Hull"
 ship_hull_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The cruiser is the most flexible warship. This hull allows construction of a light cruiser for screening and scouting, or a heavy cruiser to support the battleline."
 ship_hull_cruiser_2:1 "1007 Cruiser Hull"
 ship_hull_cruiser_3:1 "1011 Cruiser Hull"
 ship_hull_cruiser_4:1 "1015 Cruiser Hull"

 ship_hull_pre_dreadnought:0 "Pre-Dreadnought"
 ship_hull_pre_dreadnought_desc:0 "A survivor of the time before the Griffonian Empire's fall, the pre-dreadnought has only very limited combat value in this day and age."

 ship_hull_heavy_1:1 "Early Heavy Ship Hull"
 ship_hull_heavy_1_desc:0 "Considered by some to be a relic of a bygone era of naval warfare, by others as the most impressive ships ever built, no one can deny that these remnants of the battleship arms race constitute some of the most heavily armed and armored vessels ever built."
 ship_hull_heavy_2:1 "1007 Heavy Ship Hull"
 ship_hull_heavy_2_desc:0 "With improved stability and range, a new generation of battleships improve upon previous designs and bring new firepower to the seas."
 ship_hull_heavy_3:1 "1011 Heavy Ship Hull"
 ship_hull_heavy_3_desc:0 "Thicker armor, stronger engines, a battery of high-caliber guns and improved anti-air capabilities can allow battleships to remain relevant, if correctly employed, in a world where naval warfare is increasingly dominated by aerial support."
 ship_hull_heavy_4:1 "1015 Heavy Ship Hull"
 ship_hull_heavy_4_desc:0 "As the world sees what may be the last major battleship confrontations, the importance of heavy armaments and anti-air turrets is greater than ever."

 ship_hull_super_heavy_1:0 "1007 Super Heavy Battleship Hull"
 ship_hull_super_heavy_1_desc:0 "We can focus entirely on creating the heaviest, most well-armed battleships of all time, able to engage multiple lesser vessels."
 ship_hull_super_heavy_2:0 "1015 Super Heavy Battleship Hull"
 ship_hull_super_heavy_2_desc:0 "Even as carriers bring the role of the battleship into question, other naval theorists claim that modern battleships require a new kind of battleship-killer. Faster and more reliable, this new Super Heavy Battleship can carry guns powerful enough to punch through any other armor in the world."

 ship_hull_carrier_conversion_ca:1 "Converted Cruiser Hull"
 ship_hull_carrier_conversion_bb:1 "Converted Battleship Hull"

 ship_hull_carrier_0:1 "Early Carrier"
