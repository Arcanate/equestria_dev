 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "The End of Harmony"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A new era has dawned. Fear and uncertainty spreads amongst ponies as the world around them changes rapidly in front of their very eyes. Equestrian leadership is concerned about their neighbours, Stalliongrad and Changelings alike. While the communists in Stalliongrad rapidly industrialise, Queen Chrysalis has managed to centralise her realm around her. Equestria, while concerned about these developments, faces plenty of internal conflicts and problems. A storm is brewing in Equestria, one that friendship alone might not be able to tame."

 tarrin.47.d:0 "Grogar stood upon the balcony of the highest tower in Tambelon, and surveyed His realm. The bright sun shone upon the scorching sands of the Zebhara desert. He remembered how this land had once been fertile and green. Now, it was a wasteland. Perhaps one day, flowers would blossom here again.\n\n"M'lord," came a sound from behind him, and He turned. It was Bray, a donkey who had prepared the returning ritual and was His most loyal assistant. "The six goats who aided me wish to speak to you." Grogar nodded, so Bray bowed and left. Soon, the six heroes entered the balcony and knelt before Him. He already knew their names: Gore, Randy, Oskar, Giles, Abram and Rachel.\n"Rise," He commanded, and they did so. "You have proven yourself to be competent and cunning. Therefore, you shall become my advisors. Your first task is to tell me what has happened to the world while I was gone."\n"The world has gone to ruin," Rachel explained. "The lesser races have failed to find unity and squabble amongst themselves. Some of your monsters still roam the land to this day, as nobody has managed to exterminate them yet. The fools are obsessed with technology rather than magic."\n"So are you," said Randy and bleated in amusement.\n"Silence!" Grogar commanded. "If we plan to reclaim our world, then we must be better than the barbarians. I shall tolerate no infighting or tinkering with useless gadgets. Do you understand?"\n"B-but m'lord," Rachel complained, "I retrieved your bell with a telesco-"\n"Quiet! You no longer need the aid of technology. It is time for goats to once more become the masters of magic.""

 eaw_debug.4.t:0 "A Lost Art"
 eaw_debug.4.d:0 "Grogar entered the vast vaults beneath Tambelon. The many creatures imprisoned there sensed His presence and went silent in an instant. He looked at them and remembered all he had planned to do with them, before that accursed pony, Gusty, had banished him to the shadow realm.\n\nNow, he could finally fulfill those plans.\n\nHe kept walking and entered into the lower levels, where His previous creations were kept. They were all beautiful in their own way, even the failed experiments that barely lived, suffering constantly. Learning experiences had a beauty of their own, and Grogar kept them to remind himself of His failures. But the most beautiful creatures were the successful ones. He was especially proud of hydras, a creature he had made to rival His ancient enemy, the dragons. Yet there were many other fine creatures too. Some had been created by other goats, His finest apprentices. It's a shame Gusty's army had slaughtered so many of them, but he was thankful they had never discovered the vault. Otherwise, every single monster here would've been callously killed by the foolish ponies.\n\nNow it was time to release many of these captive monsters, and to put the animals to use. The might of Tambelon would slowly but surely be rebuilt. New terrible monsters would be made, and the world would learn to fear goats again."
