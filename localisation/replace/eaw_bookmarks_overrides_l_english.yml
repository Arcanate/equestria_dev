 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "The End of Harmony"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A new era has dawned. Fear and uncertainty spreads amongst ponies as the world around them changes rapidly in front of their very eyes. Equestrian leadership is concerned about their neighbours, Stalliongrad and Changelings alike. While the communists in Stalliongrad rapidly industrialise, Queen Chrysalis has managed to centralise her realm around her. Equestria, while concerned about these developments, faces plenty of internal conflicts and problems. A storm is brewing in Equestria, one that friendship alone might not be able to tame."

 tarrin.47.d:0 "Grogar stood upon the balcony of the highest tower in Tambelon, and surveyed His realm. The bright sun shone upon the scorching sands of the Zebhara desert. He remembered how this land had once been fertile and green. Now, it was a wasteland. Perhaps one day, flowers would blossom here again.\n\n"M'lord," came a sound from behind him, and He turned. It was Bray, a donkey who had prepared the returning ritual and was His most loyal assistant. "The six goats who aided me wish to speak to you." Grogar nodded, so Bray bowed and left. Soon, the six heroes entered the balcony and knelt before Him. He already knew their names: Gore, Randy, Oskar, Giles, Abram and Rachel.\n"Rise," He commanded, and they did so. "You have proven yourself to be competent and cunning. Therefore, you shall become my advisors. Your first task is to tell me what has happened to the world while I was gone."\n"The world has gone to ruin," Rachel explained. "The lesser races have failed to find unity and squabble amongst themselves. Some of your monsters still roam the land to this day, as nobody has managed to exterminate them yet. The fools are obsessed with technology rather than magic."\n"So are you," said Randy and bleated in amusement.\n"Silence!" Grogar commanded. "If we plan to reclaim our world, then we must be better than the barbarians. I shall tolerate no infighting or tinkering with useless gadgets. Do you understand?"\n"B-but m'lord," Rachel complained, "I retrieved your bell with a telesco-"\n"Quiet! You no longer need the aid of technology. It is time for goats to once more become the masters of magic.""

 eaw_debug.4.d:0 "Grogar entered the vast vaults beneath Tambelon. The many creatures imprisoned there sensed His presence and went silent in an instant. He looked at them and remembered all he had planned to do with them, before that accursed pony, Gusty, had banished him to the Realm of Darkness.\n\nNow, he could finally fulfill those plans.\n\nHe kept walking and entered into the lower levels, where His previous creations were kept. They were all beautiful in their own way, even the failed experiments that barely lived, suffering constantly. Learning experiences had a beauty of their own, and Grogar kept them to remind himself of His failures. But the most beautiful creatures were the successful ones. He was especially proud of hydras, a creature he had made to rival His ancient enemy, the dragons. Yet there were many other fine creatures too. Some had been created by other goats, His finest apprentices. It's a shame Gusty's army had slaughtered so many of them, but he was thankful they had never discovered the vault. Otherwise, every single monster here would've been callously killed by the foolish ponies.\n\nNow it was time to release many of these captive monsters, and to put the animals to use. The might of Tambelon would slowly but surely be rebuilt. New terrible monsters would be made, and the world would learn to fear goats again."

 eaw_debug.5.t:0 "The Natural Order"
 eaw_debug.5.d:0 "Tin Zinan couldn't help but feel helpless. Out of nowhere, demonic goats had appeared out of the desert, accompanied by terrifying beasts. There was little they did to resist, and those brave ones who did quickly perished. His people, the folk of Azir, were driven out of their homes and herded like cattle into a vast, dark city which appeared like a desert mirage. There, they were all forced to work, no matter their rank. Chieftains laboured alongside servants. They were all equal in slavery now.\n\nTin Zinan had been a slave once. And he had sworn to never be one again.\n\nDay and night, they all toiled in a workshop, where they were instructed to make large plates of crystal-infused armour for the beasts. They were forced to use the most basic tools and were allowed little rest and few provisions. Tin Zinan couldn't stand for this. He had to show that zebras like him would never accept slavery. Death was preferable to it.\n\nHe stood up on a workbench and proclaimed to all other slaves: "My fellow Azirians! A most terrible fate has befallen us. Yet do not despair! Hope lives on in our hearts. One day, we shall break free from our shackles! We must never fully submit, but always use little acts of resistance to defy our evil masters. Sabotage the armour, work as slowly as possible, go on hunger strike, do anything you can to show that you are free zebras!"\n\nThe other slaves cheered and chanted his name, and a riot started as they began to break tools and dismantle the plates they had made. But it did not last long. Soon, the doors broke open and ravenous chimeras and manticores poured inside. A terrible slaughter began. Zebras screamed as they were torn apart by claws and teeth and eaten alive. Tin Zinan did his best to fight back, but it was all in vain.\n\nOn the following day, Tin Zinan and a dozen other rebellious slaves returned to the workshops. Their bodies had been modified: Mouths had been replaced with small feeding holes and their rear legs had been removed, forcing them to crawl like maggots.  It was a warning to all slaves that resistance would be punished most severely."

 eaw_debug.6.d:0 "Princess Twilight Sparkle was sipping her morning coffee while reading the news. She frowned as she saw an article talking about a famed archaeologist who had gone missing. The name was familiar to her, as she had attended his presentation about the mysterious ruins he had studied in Azir. His family was begging for any information about his whereabouts. She felt sorry for them and hoped he would be found soon, alive and well.\n\nWhile the desert of Azir was still fresh on her mind, she spotted another, tiny article talking about it. There was a brief summary of strange rumours coming out of the region with nothing substantial to support them. But it was strange coincidence that these rumours had appeared around the same time when the archaeologist had gone missing. Could there be a connection?\n\nPerhaps she was just being paranoid as always. But a part of her wanted to investigate the matter. If anything, she wanted to bring closure to the archaeologist's family."
 eaw_debug.6.a:0 "Maybe there's something more to this?"

 eaw_debug.7.d:0 ""Do not worry, darling, detective Rarity will unravel the mystery!"\nTwilight frowned. "Is the costume absolutely necessary?"\n"Why yes, of course!" Rarity said, wearing a black trench coat and a fedora. "I must channel the persona of Shadow Spade to get fully immersed in the role of a detective."\nTwilight rolled her eyes. "If you say so." She turned to the door of the archaeologist's apartment and unlocked it with a key given by his family. The two ponies entered and looked around. "Hm, nothing seems out of the ordinary," Twilight mumbled.\nRarity took a closer look, narrowing her eyes and inspecting the furniture. "That is because you do not look with the eyes of a detective. Aha!" Her horn glowed and she levitated a strand of white hair. "According to your description, the missing individual did not have a white tail, coat or mane, yet I found this!"\n"That's... strange, but doesn't really prove anything. Let's keep looking, I guess."\n"Yes, the more clues the better!"\nNext they inspected the archaeologist's office table. There were various notes about previous expeditions, but nothing about Azir. "Strange," Twilight said. "I think there's some papers missing, but they're not here."\n"Tsk tsk! Again, think like a detective. What if there's a hidden compartment?"\n"...Why would he hide notes about his studies?"\nRarity leaned closer at the table and knocked at the wood with her hoof, listening closely at the sound. "Quiet, I'm trying to hear a hollow sound." After several knocks, her eyes widened and she rubbed the surface, looking for a seam. Once she found it, she used magic to pull up a lid which revealed concealed papers. "Here they are!"\nTwilight was flabbergasted as Rarity gave the papers to her. "You found them! They're all about his final survey at Azir!" She quickly skimmed over the papers and even found a few drawings. One of them depicted a strange black sphere of crystal."
