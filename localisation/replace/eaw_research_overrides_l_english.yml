 excavation_tech:0 "Excavation Technologies Research Speed"

 concentrated_industry:0 "Larger Workspaces"
 concentrated_industry_desc:0 "Something as simple as larger workspaces for our manufacturers to operate in allows for a concentration of material, work lines, and workers. It will make individual factories more productive but worsen the consequences should something go wrong...\n\n"
 concentrated_industry2:0 "Multiple Integrated Production Lines"
 concentrated_industry2_desc:0 "Should the equipment and products composed of multiple different parts, it would only stand to reason to set up the necessary production lines in the same facility. This dramatically increases output while keeping costs down."
 concentrated_industry3:0 "Adapted Transportation Links"
 concentrated_industry3_desc:0 "Larger industrial complexes require a far greater input of material to maintain production efficiency. Preparing specialised transportation hubs and integration to allow the greater flow of equipment and material to allow expansion of our existing factories."
 concentrated_industry4:0 "Aggregated Factories"
 concentrated_industry4_desc:0 "Why have different similar factories apart from one another when they could be accrued into one mega-complex? The costs would be diminished, and the overall efficiency and output will increase significantly."
 concentrated_industry5:0 "Industrial Towns"
 concentrated_industry5_desc:0 "Further centralisation of manufactories requires a wholly different layout to how we plan and build complexes. Logistics and accommodations must be taken into consideration if we intend to continue expanding existing factories. With commercial and residential blocks, these mega-complexes are starting to look like entire towns, and with good reason!"

 dispersed_industry:0 "Separated Complexes"
 dispersed_industry_desc:0 "Spreading out the infrastructure of our industry is counter-intuitive if we were aiming for gross output. Still, separating workers, materials, and production lines from one another toughens the overall infrastructure should it be targeted by enemy forces or saboteurs.\n\n"
 dispersed_industry2:0 "Downscaled Lines"
 dispersed_industry2_desc:0 "We have enough machinery, material and workers to build large industrial complexes. However, our efforts would be better spent by making smaller yet more numerous factories to maintain overall production capacity should something go wrong."
 dispersed_industry3:0 "Integrated Long-Distance Transportation"
 dispersed_industry3_desc:0 "Generally, complex products such as rifles or vehicles are composed of multiple parts that need to be manufactured. By keeping these as far apart as possible while connecting them with robust transportation lines, our industrial capacity will grow while keeping it safe."
 dispersed_industry4:0 "Disguised Factories"
 dispersed_industry4_desc:0 "Camouflaging our more critical factories as different, harmless industries helps divert unwanted attention from them, thus further protecting our vital production lines. "
 dispersed_industry5:0 "Underground Facilities"
 dispersed_industry5_desc:0 "To further hide our factories, we can transfer them underground, disguised as hills. A costly and massive undertaking, but necessary to maintain secrecy and to make them resistant against attacks."

 construction1:0 "Steel and Cement"
 construction1_desc:0 "Since the industrial revolution, there has been a global population boom that outpaced more traditional construction methods. With a greater demand for new buildings and refurbished edifices that can last, wood and stone construction must give way to cement and steel. It is a massive shakeup, but a necessary one."
 construction2:0 "Pneumatic Tools"
 construction2_desc:0 "Hammers, wrenches, and saws will still see their use well into the future. Still, more modern construction methods require tools such as riveters, pneumatic drills, and nail guns, which in turn make for better and more solid buildings that can be erected even faster."
 construction3:0 "Mechanised Construction"
 construction3_desc:0 "For time immemorial, we have used machines for larger constructions. However, with greater and easier access to fuel-powered machines such as trucks and cranes, the same work and tasks necessary for construction are far less labour-intensive and can be done at a fraction of the time. There is a relatively high upfront and recurring cost in acquiring these new machines, but this is massively offset by the savings they bring."
 construction4:0 "The Moment Distribution Method"
 construction4_desc:0 "As beam structures proliferate and grow taller and more ambitious, further structural analysis is required, specifically for the flexural effects upon the joints of structures. Developing fixed-end moments distributed as such as to achieve equilibrium in the overall design. This somewhat math-intensive methodology does require specialised engineers, but it will produce larger and sturdier structures. "
 construction5:0 "Utilitarian Architecture"
 construction5_desc:0 "Much as traditionalists will bemoan current architectural trends, there is no denying that newer structures are far more practical and inexpensive. Adopting these architectural designs as the new standard for concurrent construction may create 'ugly' districts and cities. Still, they shall be monuments of our might, well after we're gone!"

 excavation1:0 "Hydraulic Drills"
 excavation1_desc:0 "A sturdy shovel and pickaxe may be the universal symbol of the miner, but they are labour-intensive tools. With the introduction of hydraulic tools such as presses and drills, we significantly cut down the risk of exhaustion for our miners, even in hot, damp underground mines. With minimal training, a single miner armed with a drill will outperform ten miners with pickaxes and shovels."
 excavation2:0 "Geological Mapping"
 excavation2_desc:0 "Prospecting of and exploration for new common metal reserves is a slow and painstaking process. If done poorly, different mining groups might accidentally hit the same vein! This is why proper geological mapping is essential to help distinguish the various strata of the earth and narrow down potential prospecting spots."
 excavation3:0 "Standardised Mechanisation"
 excavation3_desc:0 "Not all mines have the appropriate machinery, such as mine cages, hoists, skips, and raise borers, that reduce risk and increase output. Ensuring a national standard of equipment and machines to automate as much of the exploration as possible is smart and ethical, making the workplace safer."
 excavation4:0 "Early Open-Pit Mining Operations"
 excavation4_desc:0 "On a wholly different scale from traditional quarries, open-pit mining is a mostly mechanised form of surface mining that uses horizontal benches. Far more suitable for surfaces that prevent tunnelling, open-pit mines allow for easy expansions until the mineral resource is exhausted. This method is relatively expensive, requiring large excavators and trucks to haul the ore and waste material. Still, it makes for a fast and easy method for large mining operations."
 excavation5:0 "Shrinkage Stoping"
 excavation5_desc:0 "Stopes have been created since the beginning of underground mining. However, manual stope systems have been surpassed by shrinkage stoping—the mining proceeds from the bottom up in horizontal slices with the broken ore left in place for miners to work on. This is a far more efficient and safer stoping method, which improves a mine's overall yield."

 fuel_silos:0 "Organised Fuel Storage"
 fuel_silos_desc:0 "As liquid fuels become ever more commonplace and their storage grows, facilities dedicated to safeguard the resource become necessary. Silos and tanks to contain the fuel, pipes to allow easy access and transfer, and valves to secure it. These storage facilities are designed with potential expansion in mind should we need to increase our reserves."

 synth_oil_experiments:0 "Synthetic Material Experiments"
 synth_oil_experiments_desc:0 "As the world industrialises, the demand for valuable resources outpaces their natural supply. Synthesisation of oil and rubber show promise, with synthetic hydrocarbon oils and isoprene respectively being prime candidates in this effort."

 oil_processing:0 "Initial Hydrocarbon Oils"
 oil_processing_desc:0 "A somewhat poor alternative to conventional petroleum, hydrocarbon oils are based on organic compounds consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon. Certain alkanes make for a suitable combustible fuel source that can supplement other more efficient fuels."
 improved_oil_processing:0 "Exploration of Hydrocarbons"
 improved_oil_processing_desc:0 "Growing fuel demands necessitate additional use of all of our fuels, including hydrocarbon oils. More streamlined extraction and storage methods for these will help meet the demand, even though petroleum is still a premium fuel source."
 advanced_oil_processing:0 "New Hydrogenation Processes"
 advanced_oil_processing_desc:0 "A developmental breakthrough in hydrogenation has made possible the production of a synthetic oil from coal dust. With copious amount of coal, this new synthetic oil may prove to be just as plentiful, if not more, than petroleum."
 modern_oil_processing:0 "Liquid Hydrocarbons"
 modern_oil_processing_desc:1 "Converting a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen to liquid hydrocarbons greatly expand the possibilities for alternative fuel sources. Though still somewhat less efficient than regular fuel, liquid hydrocarbon is just as viable due to the ease of storage compared to other hydrocarbon fuels."

 rubber_processing:0 "Semi-Synthetic Rubber Processing"
 rubber_processing_desc:1 "We know that heating isoprene with hydrochloric acid produces a rubber-like polymer. Though isoprene can only be obtained from distilling natural rubber, this process allows for an increased output from regular distillation and vulcanisation of rubber if we invest in it."
 improved_rubber_processing:0 "Initial Synthetic Rubber Processing"
 improved_rubber_processing_desc:1 "With the discovery of turpentine cracking, we can obtain isoprene without relying on natural rubber, though the process takes several weeks before ready to be turned into the rubber-like polymer."
 advanced_rubber_processing:0 "Sodium-based Polymerisation"
 advanced_rubber_processing_desc:1 "The polymerisation of isoprene can be sped up considerably with the use of sodium. Needless to say, this process will greatly increase output of artificial rubber."
 modern_rubber_processing:0 "Butadiene-based Polymerisation"
 modern_rubber_processing_desc:1 "Previous iterations of synthetic rubber have always been inferior to distilled natural rubber, making them less reliable. Polybutadiene, a butadiene polymer, is significantly more durable than natural rubber, effectively increasing our rubber production."

 fuel_refining:0 "Systemised Naphtha Refineries"
 fuel_refining_desc:0 "Previously, 'stills' could be used to separate the constituents of crude oil and condense the resultant vapours into liquid fractions, primarily kerosene and 'straight run' naphtha. There has been a scramble to produce the necessary naphtha with the invention of the internal combustion engine, leading to erratic and disorganised refining facilities. By organising the refineries with considerations made for all aspects, overall fuel production will improve and grow more efficient."
 fuel_refining2:0 "Improved Thermal Cracking"
 fuel_refining2_desc:0 "Automotive fuel is beginning to outstrip the market requirements for naphtha and kerosene. Thus, we must convert to light fuels such as gasoline. Previously a fraction byproduct from thermal cracking, we can improve distillation methods to favour greater yields of the more valuable gasoline instead of kerosene or naphtha."
 fuel_refining3:0 "Advancements in Naphtha Catalysation"
 fuel_refining3_desc:0 "A byproduct of a typical atmospheric distillation of crude oil is 'heavy' naphtha, which catalysed into a reformate essential for the gasoline blend. Advancements in this process vastly improve the gasoline blending pool's capacity and increase fuel production."
 fuel_refining4:0 "Reclaiming Coker and FCC Gas Oil"
 fuel_refining4_desc:0 "The process of producing coker naphtha and fluid catalytic cracker (FCC) gasoline creates gas oil as a wasted byproduct, typically unused in producing fuel. We've discovered that we can make fuel oil by using both the coker and the FCC with the gas oil. This 'heavy' fuel is excellent for marine engines and provides our maritime vessels with a supplement of fuel that doesn't cut into our general fuel reserves."
 fuel_refining5:0 "Supplemental Diesel Production"
 fuel_refining5_desc:0 "We've been creating diesel oil as a side product of our atmospheric distillation and hydrocracking for some time. Though it is louder, 'dirtier', and requires a different ignition process in engines from gasoline, diesel is more efficient. We might not entirely shift over to diesel, but not exploiting this other fuel source would be foolish, as we can produce more fuel overall with it."

 interwar_artillery:0 "Applied Artillery Experience"
 artillery1:0 "Rechambering Methods"
 artillery2:0 "New Howitzer Designs"
 artillery3:0 "Muzzle Brakes"
 artillery3_desc:0 "To cut down on barrel length and weight, venting devices such as muzzle brakes and recoil compensators reduce the area needed to take up the strokes of recoil and kickback."
 artillery4:0 "Dismantlable Artillery"
 artillery5:0 "Low Silhouetted Artillery"
 artillery5_desc:0 "Artillery designs with lower silhouettes better hide the piece and will allow the guns to fire for longer before being spotted."

 rocket_artillery2:0 "Multiple Rocket Launchers"
 rocket_artillery2_desc:0 "Self-propelled artillery utilizing multiple rockets will be able to cause large-scale destruction rapidly, while maintaining mobility to avoid counter-fire."
 rocket_artillery3:0 "Low-Range Heavy Rockets"
 rocket_artillery4:0 "Spin-stabilisation"
 rocket_artillery4_desc:0 "Spin-stabilized rockets can increase the range of lighter artillery batteries, increasing their efficacy."

 antiair1:0 "Enlarged Feeding Mechanisms"
 antiair2:0 "High-Altitude Ammunition"
 antiair3:0 "Initial Radar Target Coordination"
 antiair4:0 "Radar Integration"
 antiair4_desc:0 "Combining more modern systems of radar and autoloaders will be necessary to react quickly against faster aircraft such as jets."

 antitank1:0 "Applied Anti-Tank Experience"
 antitank2:0 "Larger Caliber Guns"
 antitank3:0 "High-Explosive Anti-Tank Rounds"
 antitank3_desc:0 "Due to the excellent penetration qualities of High-Explosive Anti-Tank (HEAT) rounds, low-velocity guns can now defeat enemy armour that it could not hope to with standard ammunition."
 antitank4:0 "Self-Discarding Sabot"
