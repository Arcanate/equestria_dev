 synth_oil_experiments:0 "Synthetic Material Experiments"
 synth_oil_experiments_desc:0 "As the world industrialises, the demand for valuable resources outpaces their natural supply. Synthesisation of oil and rubber show promise, with synthetic hydrocarbon oils and isoprene respectively being prime candidates in this effort."
 oil_processing:0 "Oil Processing"
 oil_processing_desc:0 "A network of factories for synthetic distillation and refining of oil products is the next step towards ensuring the fuel supply for our nation."
 improved_oil_processing:0 "Improved Oil Processing"
 improved_oil_processing_desc:0 "Moving previously experimental methods for distillation to large-scale operations will allow us to adapt better to available materials and needs."
 advanced_oil_processing:0 "Advanced Oil Processing"
 advanced_oil_processing_desc:0 "New experimental purification techniques like hydrotreating can be used in oil manufacturing to greatly improve the final product."
 modern_oil_processing:0 "Modern Oil Processing"
 modern_oil_processing_desc:1 "Our oil refinineries can be further improved with new advanced oil processing methods like hydrocracking, alkylation, mercaptan oxidation and isomerization."

 rubber_processing:0 "Semi-Synthetic Rubber Processing"
 rubber_processing_desc:1 "We know that heating isoprene with hydrochloric acid produces a rubber-like polymer. Though isoprene can only be obtained from distilling natural rubber, this process allows for an increased output from regular distillation and vulcanisation of rubber if we invest in it."
 improved_rubber_processing:0 "Initial Synthetic Rubber Processing"
 improved_rubber_processing_desc:1 "With the discovery of turpentine cracking, we can obtain isoprene without relying on natural rubber, though the process takes several weeks before ready to be turned into the rubber-like polymer."
 advanced_rubber_processing:0 "Sodium-based Polymerisation"
 advanced_rubber_processing_desc:1 "The polymerisation of isopreme can be sped up considerably with the use of sodium. Needless to say, this process will greatly increase output of artificial rubber."
 modern_rubber_processing:0 "Butadiene-based Polymerisation"
 modern_rubber_processing_desc:1 "Previous iterations of synthetic rubber have always been inferior to distilled natural rubber, making them less reliable. Polybutadiene, a butadiene polymer, is significantly more durable than natural rubber, effectively increasing our rubber production."
