 synth_oil_experiments:0 "Synthetic Material Experiments"
 synth_oil_experiments_desc:0 "As the world industrialises, the demand for valuable resources outpaces their natural supply. Synthesisation of oil and rubber show promise, with synthetic hydrocarbon oils and isoprene respectively being prime candidates in this effort."

 oil_processing:0 "Initial Hydrocarbon Oils"
 oil_processing_desc:0 "A somewhat poor alternative to conventional petroleum, hydrocarbon oils are based on organic compounds consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon. Certain alkanes make for a suitable combustible fuel source that can supplement other more efficient fuels."
 improved_oil_processing:0 "Exploration of Hyrdrocabons"
 improved_oil_processing_desc:0 "Growing fuel demands necessitate additional use of all of our fuels, including hydrocarbon oils. More streamlined extraction and storage methods for these will help meet the demand, even though petroleum is still a premium fuel source."
 advanced_oil_processing:0 "New Hydrogenation Processes"
 advanced_oil_processing_desc:0 "A developmental breakthrough in hydrogenation has made possible the production of a synthetic oil from coal dust. With the copious amount of coal, this new synthetic oil may prove to be just as plentiful, if not more, than petroleum."
 modern_oil_processing:0 "Liquid Hydrocarbons"
 modern_oil_processing_desc:1 "Converting a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen to liquid hydrocarbons greatly expand the possibilities for alternative fuel sources. Though still somewhat less efficient than regular fuel, liquid hydrocarbon is just as viable due to the ease of storage compared to other hydrocarbon fuels."

 rubber_processing:0 "Semi-Synthetic Rubber Processing"
 rubber_processing_desc:1 "We know that heating isoprene with hydrochloric acid produces a rubber-like polymer. Though isoprene can only be obtained from distilling natural rubber, this process allows for an increased output from regular distillation and vulcanisation of rubber if we invest in it."
 improved_rubber_processing:0 "Initial Synthetic Rubber Processing"
 improved_rubber_processing_desc:1 "With the discovery of turpentine cracking, we can obtain isoprene without relying on natural rubber, though the process takes several weeks before ready to be turned into the rubber-like polymer."
 advanced_rubber_processing:0 "Sodium-based Polymerisation"
 advanced_rubber_processing_desc:1 "The polymerisation of isoprene can be sped up considerably with the use of sodium. Needless to say, this process will greatly increase output of artificial rubber."
 modern_rubber_processing:0 "Butadiene-based Polymerisation"
 modern_rubber_processing_desc:1 "Previous iterations of synthetic rubber have always been inferior to distilled natural rubber, making them less reliable. Polybutadiene, a butadiene polymer, is significantly more durable than natural rubber, effectively increasing our rubber production."
