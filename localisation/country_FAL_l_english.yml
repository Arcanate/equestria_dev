#industrial path
FAL_educate_farmers:0 "Dissolve Feudal Archaisms"
FAL_educate_farmers_desc:0 "[FAL.GetName] has never been a particularly developed nation, but the loss of our prized capital has seemingly put any progress to a halt. To address the various issues that concern our nation, serfdom and tithes are to be abolished, and a more contemporary system emulating ones in Aquila and Griffenheim shall be established. By no means will this solve all our problems, but it is a painful start."

FAL_new_factories:0 "New Industrial Base"
FAL_new_factories_desc:0 "Outside of Falcor, beyond our grasp, industrialisation has been sporadic and incomplete, only pursued by those with the means to generate a profit. The government will commence the funding of state sponsored factories to resolve the lack of jobs and goods."

FAL_new_military_factories:0 "Expand Military Workshops"
FAL_new_military_factories_desc:0 "The nation needs arms. The only certainty of our future is that there will be strife, and we must be ready to protect ourselves. We might be weakened, but we will never yield as long as we can fight, and fight we shall!"

FAL_better_farmers:0 "Implements of the Modern Age"
FAL_better_farmers_desc:0 "Iron ploughs, rusted tools, broken pickaxes shall be a thing of the past. To truly bring our nation to industrial revolution, we require sturdy implements for our workers. Only that way can they efficiently perform their duties! Although we do not have the means to produce such instruments, we are capable of importing them from the north."

FAL_stabalize_economy:0 "Increase Living Standards"
FAL_stabalize_economy_desc:0 "Initial reforms have given their yield, and the former serfs now breathe the air of freedom. Many now flock to the cities in search of a better life, but the conditions are cramped and squalid. We should act before the problem exacerbates."

FAL_better_factories:0 "Improving the Process of Production"
FAL_better_factories_desc:0 "Factory work is a novelty to many griffons, and a lot of our tools and machinery are dated and potentially hazardous. Investments should be made in this area, to encourage our labourers to work harder, with the contemporary technology."

FAL_better_intel:0 "Electronical Ingenuity"
FAL_better_intel_desc:0 "Radios, computers, anything that runs on electrical power are very hard to find in the Falcor of today. Lagging behind in such inventions would be devastating for our nation, which is why we must make strides in importing these gadgets, and reverse-engineering them so that we can produce our own variants."

FAL_new_trains:0 "Double the Railway Lines"
FAL_new_trains_desc:0 "At the current state of development, trains are the fastest method for civilian transport, military redeployments and moving goods around. However, our steam locomotives are slow and need to be replaced. Additionally, we shall look into building new railway lines for the new trains, which will also use a different gauge compared to the Wingbardian ones."

FAL_improve_illiteracy:0 "Combating Illiteracy"
FAL_improve_illiteracy_desc:0 "Most griffons pay no heed to books and knowledge, for their burdens are great, and their time is precious and little. As such, a dedicated campaign towards teaching everygriff how to read and write will be funded: employers will provide basic training, access to libraries will be improved, and we'll reach out to farflung communities."

FAL_industry1:0 "Industrial Modernisation"
FAL_industry1_desc:0 "First steps towards progress have been taken. The city of Matton has successfully implemented telegraph lines, electrical based machinery and more. It would only be logical to extend these advancements to the rest of Falcor, so that we all may benefit from novelty."

FAL_science1:0 "A New Pursuit for Science"
FAL_science1_desc:0 "As Falcorians slowly become more and more literate, new possibilities are opening. Higher degree schools can be opened, jobs that don't involve heavy physical exertion are becoming commonplace. All this and more will ensure our place in the world as a nation of literate griffons."

FAL_scientific_greatness:0 "[Root.Capital.GetName] University"
FAL_scientific_greatness_desc:0 "[FAL.GetLeader] has proudly announced the opening of the first higher learning institute in our nation, the [Root.Capital.GetName] University. It will provide our best and brightest citizens with the prospect of greater learning. At the present moment, this facility will offer faculties in history, engineering and mathematics."

FAL_more_schools:0 "Compulsory and Complimentary"
FAL_more_schools_desc:0 "Education shall be the right of all griffons dwelling in this nation, regardless of their position. It shall also be made mandatory for everygriffon, with no charge attached to it. The government will have to cover the cost of it, but it is the only way illiteracy can be eliminated."

FAL_can_read:0 "A Literate Falcor"
FAL_can_read_desc:0 "Our efforts have paid off and now almost every Falcorian is able to read and write. Illiteracy in major cities has decreased under 1% for both adult and children, and even in the countryside the rates don't go over 3%. The nation as a whole will benefit from our learned citizens."

FAL_farmers_can_read:0 "Feudalism Abolished"
FAL_farmers_can_read_desc:0 "All traces of serfdom has been eliminated, and every Falcorian lives as a free griffon. Farmers now own the land they work, and a majority of our population now lives in the bustling, growing cities. Although the former elites bemoan the loss of their privileges, the nation as a whole has prospered as a result. Falcor stands tall as a modern nation!"

FAL_more_factories:0 "Invest in Growing Businesses"
FAL_more_factories_desc:0 "Encouraged by our reforms, many citizens have started their own small scale companies, and factory owners have increased their wages. With careful backing of select establishments, we can increase the rate of growth while maintaining a stable economy."

FAL_more_mil_factories:0 "An Armed Society..."
FAL_more_mil_factories_desc:0 "Dangers lurk in the world, both nearby and distant. The only way a proud Falcorian can preserve his freedom is with a weapon - and that requires the expansion of our firearm facilities to ensure everygriff, soldier or civilian, has a way to defend themselves."

FAL_more_trains:0 "Connect the Countryside"
FAL_more_trains_desc:0 "Our initial campaign in expanding the railways has been a success, which makes it only senseful that we expand these lines to smaller communities. No matter where a griffon is, he shall be able to find a nearby train station and reach any city in our state."

FAL_new_banks:0 "[Root.Capital.GetName] Central Bank"
FAL_new_banks_desc:0 "As griffons seek new lives in cities, they find themselves without a sufficient capital to live a decent life. To prevent them from falling prey to loan sharks, a central bank shall be established to regulate the loan giving, serve as a gold repository, and regulate our currency. Of course, the banks will be regulated to ensure the interest rate isn't crippling."

FAL_science2:0 "Falcorian Research Laboratories"
FAL_science2_desc:0 "Our scientists clamour for specialised facilities to perform experiments and research without being disturbed. While it is a great expense, they have shown promise and given the results we needed, giving us a solid reason to fund these laboratories so that we may continue achieving new heights in science."

FAL_industry2:0 "Greatness Achieved"
FAL_industry2_desc:0 "From humble beginnings, we have achieved what nogriff thought to be possible - a modern, literate and prosperous Falcor. [FAL.GetLeader]'s success shall be remembered for future generations, and our nation state shall persevere for ages to come."
