#industrial path
FAL_educate_farmers:0 "Dissolve Feudal Archaisms"
FAL_educate_farmers_desc:0 "[FAL.GetName] has never been a particularly developed nation, but the loss of our prized capital has seemingly put any progress to a halt. To address the various issues that concern our nation, serfdom and tithes are to be abolished, and a more contemporary system emulating ones in Aquila and Griffenheim shall be established. By no means will this solve all our problems, but it is a painful start."

FAL_new_factories:0 "New Industrial Base"
FAL_new_factories_desc:0 "Outside of Falcor, beyond our grasp, industrialisation has been sporadic and incomplete, only pursued by those with the means to generate a profit. The government will commence the funding of state sponsored factories to resolve the lack of jobs and goods."

FAL_new_military_factories:0 "Expand Military Workshops"
FAL_new_military_factories_desc:0 "The nation needs arms. The only certainty of our future is that there will be strife, and we must be ready to protect ourselves. We might be weakened, but we will never yield as long as we can fight, and fight we shall!"

FAL_better_farmers:0 "Implements of the Modern Age"
FAL_better_farmers_desc:0 "Iron ploughs, rusted tools, broken pickaxes shall be a thing of the past. To truly bring our nation to industrial revolution, we require sturdy implements for our workers. Only that way can they efficiently perform their duties! Although we do not have the means to produce such instruments, we are capable of importing them from the north."

FAL_stabalize_economy:0 "Increase Living Standards"
FAL_stabalize_economy_desc:0 "Initial reforms have given their yield, and the former serfs now breathe the air of freedom. Many now flock to the cities in search of a better life, but the conditions are cramped and squalid. We should act before the problem exacerbates."

FAL_better_factories:0 "Improving the Process of Production"
FAL_better_factories_desc:0 "Factory work is a novelty to many griffons, and a lot of our tools and machinery are dated and potentially hazardous. Investments should be made in this area, to encourage our labourers to work harder, with the contemporary technology."

FAL_better_intel:0 "Electronical Ingenuity"
FAL_better_intel_desc:0 "Radios, computers, anything that runs on electrical power are very hard to find in the Falcor of today. Lagging behind in such inventions would be devastating for our nation, which is why we must make strides in importing these gadgets, and reverse-engineering them so that we can produce our own variants."

FAL_new_trains:0 "Double the Railway Lines"
FAL_new_trains_desc:0 "At the current state of development, trains are the fastest method for civilian transport, military redeployments and moving goods around. However, our steam locomotives are slow and need to be replaced. Additionally, we shall look into building new railway lines for the new trains, which will also use a different gauge compared to the Wingbardian ones."

FAL_improve_illiteracy:0 "Combating Illiteracy"
FAL_improve_illiteracy_desc:0 "Most griffons pay no heed to books and knowledge, for their burdens are great, and their time is precious and little. As such, a dedicated campaign towards teaching everygriff how to read and write will be funded: employers will provide basic training, access to libraries will be improved, and we'll reach out to farflung communities."

FAL_industry1:0 "Industrial Modernisation"
FAL_industry1_desc:0 "First steps towards progress have been taken. The city of Matton has successfully implemented telegraph lines, electrical based machinery and more. It would only be logical to extend these advancements to the rest of Falcor, so that we all may benefit from novelty."

FAL_science1:0 "A New Pursuit for Science"
FAL_science1_desc:0 "As Falcorians slowly become more and more literate, new possibilities are opening. Higher degree schools can be opened, jobs that don't involve heavy physical exertion are becoming commonplace. All this and more will ensure our place in the world as a nation of literate griffons."

FAL_scientific_greatness:0 "[Root.Capital.GetName] University"
FAL_scientific_greatness_desc:0 "[FAL.GetLeader] has proudly announced the opening of the first higher learning institute in our nation, the [Root.Capital.GetName] University. It will provide our best and brightest citizens with the prospect of greater learning. At the present moment, this facility will offer faculties in history, engineering and mathematics."

FAL_more_schools:0 "Compulsory and Complimentary"
FAL_more_schools_desc:0 "Education shall be the right of all griffons dwelling in this nation, regardless of their position. It shall also be made mandatory for everygriffon, with no charge attached to it. The government will have to cover the cost of it, but it is the only way illiteracy can be eliminated."

FAL_can_read:0 "A Literate Falcor"
FAL_can_read_desc:0 "Our efforts have paid off and now almost every Falcorian is able to read and write. Illiteracy in major cities has decreased under 1% for both adult and children, and even in the countryside the rates don't go over 3%. The nation as a whole will benefit from our learned citizens."

FAL_farmers_can_read:0 "Feudalism Abolished"
FAL_farmers_can_read_desc:0 "All traces of serfdom has been eliminated, and every Falcorian lives as a free griffon. Farmers now own the land they work, and a majority of our population now lives in the bustling, growing cities. Although the former elites bemoan the loss of their privileges, the nation as a whole has prospered as a result. Falcor stands tall as a modern nation!"

FAL_more_factories:0 "Invest in Growing Businesses"
FAL_more_factories_desc:0 "Encouraged by our reforms, many citizens have started their own small scale companies, and factory owners have increased their wages. With careful backing of select establishments, we can increase the rate of growth while maintaining a stable economy."

FAL_more_mil_factories:0 "An Armed Society..."
FAL_more_mil_factories_desc:0 "Dangers lurk in the world, both nearby and distant. The only way a proud Falcorian can preserve his freedom is with a weapon - and that requires the expansion of our firearm facilities to ensure everygriff, soldier or civilian, has a way to defend themselves."

FAL_more_trains:0 "Connect the Countryside"
FAL_more_trains_desc:0 "Our initial campaign in expanding the railways has been a success, which makes it only senseful that we expand these lines to smaller communities. No matter where a griffon is, he shall be able to find a nearby train station and reach any city in our state."

FAL_new_banks:0 "[Root.Capital.GetName] Central Bank"
FAL_new_banks_desc:0 "As griffons seek new lives in cities, they find themselves without a sufficient capital to live a decent life. To prevent them from falling prey to loan sharks, a central bank shall be established to regulate the loan giving, serve as a gold repository, and regulate our currency. Of course, the banks will be regulated to ensure the interest rate isn't crippling."

FAL_science2:0 "Falcorian Research Laboratories"
FAL_science2_desc:0 "Our scientists clamour for specialised facilities to perform experiments and research without being disturbed. While it is a great expense, they have shown promise and given the results we needed, giving us a solid reason to fund these laboratories so that we may continue achieving new heights in science."

FAL_industry2:0 "Greatness Achieved"
FAL_industry2_desc:0 "From humble beginnings, we have achieved what nogriff thought to be possible - a modern, literate and prosperous Falcor. [FAL.GetLeader]'s success shall be remembered for future generations, and our nation state shall persevere for ages to come."

########################################## Fash Path #######################################################

FAL_demand_changes:0 "Appeasers No Longer"
FAL_demand_changes_desc:0 "The sham of a vote has shown that Falcor cannot continue anymore on its present path. Gabriele d'Artiglio has the right idea how to restore Falcorian greatness, and we would be wise to side with instead of the stagnant Princess and her council of fools and cowards. Glory to Falcor!"

FAL_fash_propaganda:0 "Patriotic Propaganda"
FAL_fash_propaganda_desc:0 "Maximilliana's scheme has done more harm than good, and now Falcor is broken apart even more, if such a thing were possible. What this nation needs is a strong unifying force, one that only we can provide. Remind the people of their love for their homes, their families and their Falcor."

FAL_promote_nationalism:0 "Why Falcor Matters"
FAL_promote_nationalism_desc:0 "Falcorians do not fight for more land, they fight for what is rightfully theirs! Our people need to know our goals and ideals. Spread the word in every town square, print posters, hold more demonstrations!"

FAL_flame_revanchism:0 "Galvanise the People"
FAL_flame_revanchism_desc:0 "The crowd is fickle, d'Artiglio knows this well, but if they were told what they want to hear, we'd have them in the palm of our claw. Speak to the Falcorians of the terrible Wingbardians who would defile our nation, of the indecisive Princess who does nothing but wait, of the underequipped soldier guarding the border post alone. Incite the flames of anger within the Falcorians."

FAL_take_care_of_princess:0 "Remove the Princess"
FAL_take_care_of_princess_desc:0 "The weak Princess and her husband are all that stand between us and glory. We take no pleasure in this objective, but they need to go if we want to realise our dreams. Maximilliana was never decisive or strong willed enough to see that only tough measures seize the day. Ensure the sick Queen does not hear of this, as well."

FAL_make_schools_spread_propaganda:0 "Proper Values"
FAL_make_schools_spread_propaganda_desc:0 "d'Artiglio has many followers and adorers, but a particular number of them are employed in various schools across Falcor. It would be a trivial matter to use these connections to push subtle propaganda to our young minds."

FAL_recover_depression:0 "Mourning is Over"
FAL_recover_depression_desc:0 "Falcor has gone through some very difficult times recently, but we cannot flounder and continue despairing. We must reassure the citizens that despite everything, our goals will come to realisation. But only, and only if everygriffon pledges support to the cause."

FAL_blame_wingbardy_for_killing_princess:0 "Pin the Blame"
FAL_blame_wingbardy_for_killing_princess_desc:0 "The assassination of a Princess is no trivial matter. It was a shameful act, and we must completely conceal our involvement. It is fortunate, however, that we have very convenient targets to frame, a couple Wingbardian citizens we abducted near the border. A few forged letters and forced confessions will result in much greater public support for our plans."

FAL_revenge_plan:0 "Planning for Retaliation"
FAL_revenge_plan_desc:0 "If we are to succeed in our grand endeavour, then everything must be accounted for and noted. We must make a precise estimate of our foes' forces, the general staff will prepare an invasion plan with numerous contingency options, and we shall rally the nation itself for war. Only with our full effort and might do we stand a chance."

FAL_we_need_jesus:0 "Falcor or Death"
FAL_we_need_jesus_desc:0 "Regardless of their actual opinion on the matter, we require every Falcorian to give their all! Recruitment quotas will be expanded and factory hours will be extended. No price is high enough to ensure our victory. May Arcturius give us his blessing, for our cause is just and noble."

FAL_train_falcorian_resistance:0 "Partisans and Resistance"
FAL_train_falcorian_resistance_desc:0 "[WNG.GetLeader] would have you believe that the city of Falcor has converted to Wingbardian culture, but we know better. We've heard stories of native Falcorians being treated like cattle, overlooked in favour of immigrants. We shall reach out to our contacts in Falcor and have them commence insurrections against the hated occupiers."

FAL_defenders_of_the_black_eagle:0 "Black Eagle Defenders"
FAL_defenders_of_the_black_eagle_desc:0 "Salute the flag of Falcor! Salute the proud Falcorian soldiers, who are putting their lives at risk for the ultimate sacrifice. Remind them all what we fight for, and why our cause is patriotic and righteous! Let nogriff say that Falcorians have no honour."

FAL_volunteers_from_farmers:0 "Press Farmers into Service"
FAL_volunteers_from_farmers_desc:0 "The business of war requires numbers, and our numbers are shamefully low compared to the wretched, debased Wingbardians. The conscription quotas have already passed over everygriff not employed in a crucial service, which leaves us with a painful choice to expand it over our bread baskets. However, one bad harvest will mean little once Wingbardy lies broken and ruined."

FAL_bunker_down:0 "Emergency Fortifications"
FAL_bunker_down_desc:0 "One of the causes of the previous defeat was a lack of sturdy defences along the frontline. To avoid the same scenario repeating itself, the d'Artiglio Line will be built near the border, so that we have an option for a tactical retreat should things go sour."

FAL_wingbardy_war:0 "Abrogate the Shameful Treaty"
FAL_wingbardy_war_desc:0 "The treaty of Asbolus has been the most humiliating, demeaning, disgraceful event in the entire history of Falcor itself! We shall see its terms undone as we proudly march to battle against the arrogant scum! We shall cross the Piumave, we shall enter Karthin, they have no chance against the might of Falcor! Follow d'Artiglio to war!"

FAL_reunite_falcor:0 "Our Grand Return"
FAL_reunite_falcor_desc:0 "Nearly two decades have passed, but we have arrived home. Falcor has, for the most part, remained unchanged. The only thing marring our beautiful city are the immigrants, but that can be easily resolved. For now, our primary concern is to relocate all vital industries to Falcor itself, and move the government to the old royal palace."

FAL_our_revenge:0 "Burn Karthin to the Ground"
FAL_our_revenge_desc:0 "Vergeltung! The Wingbardians lie at our mercy and we have none to spare. To teach them a lesson they will never forget, Karthin will be reduced to rubble. The population will be forcibly relocated, train tracks shall be ripped, national treasures stolen, and anything of value moved back to Falcor, the true jewel of the south."

FAL_make_wingbardy_teach_falcor_way:0 "Stealing Science"
FAL_make_wingbardy_teach_falcor_way_desc:0 "Karthin contains some of the largest repositories of science in Griffonia, numerous libraries containing original manuscripts, to state of the art research facilities. It would only be appropriate that this ingenuity is added to our capable claws, where it will find much greater use."

FAL_make_falcor_great:0 "Public Works Project"
FAL_make_falcor_great_desc:0 "With an influx of new citizens, we find ourselves facing the issues of rising unemployment and poverty. Quick measures must be taken before the situation deteriorates, and our first act shall be to commence a series of large scale construction projects, primarily focused on expanding infrastructure in the reunited Falcor."

FAL_move_industry_home:0 "Appropriate Wingbardian Industry"
FAL_move_industry_home_desc:0 "Our campaign to reduce Karthin's prestige has been a great success. Now comes the final step: to transport its industrial might. Machinery shall be loaded on trains and trucks and transported back to Falcor. What can't be moved, shall be destroyed. Leave nothing of value, leave them nothing to be proud of."

FAL_force_wingbardy_to_convert_to_falcor_culture:0 "Syncretising Cultures"
FAL_force_wingbardy_to_convert_to_falcor_culture_desc:0 "This war has shown an undisputable truth - if Wingbardians were so mighty and strong as they claimed, they wouldn't have lost against a supposedly inferior nation. Indeed, by this fact it is obvious that the Falkisch culture is superior! Our new subjects must accept this reality and adapt, or be scorned."

FAL_expand_nation:0 "Exacting Further Vengeance"
FAL_expand_nation_desc:0 "With the Wingbardian tyrants and their petty lackeys defeated, we now turn our attention to the ones who repudiated us so long ago. If they had supported us, we would have been the ones to dictate the terms in 989! We Falcorians have not forgotten this disrespect."

FAL_attack_sicameon:0 "Crossing the Arahno Mountains"
FAL_attack_sicameon_desc:0 "Much like the fabled Grover II, we shall recreate the invasion of Sicameon. In full Falcorian might shall we march across their borders and put an end to their delusions of federalism and democracy. Had they stood with us in our time of need, they would have been our partners and allies. And yet, they have chosen poorly."

FAL_attack_the_cow_people:0 "Invade the Archipelago"
FAL_attack_the_cow_people_desc:0 "The minotaurs of Asterion stand in our way of assuming dominance across southern Griffonia. The feeble ponies cannot harm us, the mountain clans are but a nuisance. Thus it is only proper that we, as a mighty nation, remove the final obstacle in securing lasting peace and dominance for Falcor."

FAL_steal_sicameon_scientists:0 "Espouse Sicameonese Naval Tradition"
FAL_steal_sicameon_scientists_desc:0 "Sicameon holds a proud naval tradition spanning back centuries, and their expertise in constructing ships and fighting battles would come useful to our burgeoning navy. Indeed, if they cooperate in sharing their knowledge and production, we shall refrain from exacting any other burden on their people."

FAL_force_sica_citizens_to_work_for_us:0 "Cruel Irony"
FAL_force_sica_citizens_to_work_for_us_desc:0 "The concept of slavery is abhorrent to any griffon, but the Sicameonese hold a special grudge against it, as they are known to frequently send warships to intercept suspected slave vessels. In a grand show of might makes right, they shall be put to work. And their toils will only end once Falcor is rebuilt to its former glory."

FAL_make_sica_a_true_member_of_legion:0 "Quell the Defiance"
FAL_make_sica_a_true_member_of_legion_desc:0 "It is time to purge the remainder of the Sicameonese resistance, one way or the other. By the right of our conquest, they shall be made citizens of Falcor, subject to all its laws and taxes, whether they like it or not."

FAL_employ_cow_designers:0 "Stylish Uniforms"
FAL_employ_cow_designers_desc:0 "The minotaurs are famous for their quality of sewing. Perhaps having fingers makes the creation of quality clothing easier? Our soldiers in the field have noted that the Asterionese uniforms are far more comfortable, while providing adequate protection from the elements. They shall be put to good use, and there's a lot of troops that need new clothing..."

FAL_cow_army:0 "Asterionese Auxiliaries"
FAL_cow_army_desc:0 "Hulking beasts, the minotaurs are known to be excellent fighters due to their bipedal nature. An advantage that would be a shame to cast aside! We shall hold limited, small scale recruitment programs across the archipelago, and the ones who apply will be assigned important duties such as raising fortifications or carrying shells. Most importantly, it all must be voluntary lest we provoke their ire."

FAL_allow_good_cows_to_be_citizens:0 "Service Guarantees Citizenship"
FAL_allow_good_cows_to_be_citizens_desc:0 "Falcor does not discriminate based on culture or race - everycreature who completes a ten year service in any branch of the armed forces shall be granted full citizenship in our state. [FAL.GetLeader] hopes that this will encourage the isolationist minotaurs to integrate in our grand nation, spanning across the vast shores of southern Griffonia."

FAL_dreams_achieved:0 "Falcor Above All"
FAL_dreams_achieved_desc:0 "From Wrobert to Minos, [FAL.GetNameDef] stands as the undisputed master of southern Griffonia. The ponies can spout their grievances all they want, but the truth is that [FAL.GetLeader]'s tough measures is what made our dream come true. Falcor has been saved from the edge of Maar's abyss and the Wingbardians will never threaten us again. Hail to our most glorious victory!"


########################### Neutral/harmony Path ###########################################

FAL_politcal_unrest:0 "The Ongoing Crisis"
FAL_politcal_unrest_desc:0 "The pressure from the radicals has reached a boiling point, and they demand change. Otherwise, they will incite further unrest and potentially overthrow the rightful rule! The Princess has chosen the following course of action: Falcor's most important and influential griffons will be invited to the Matton Residence, whereupon they will decide the future of our nation."

FAL_princess_wins_election:0 "Faith Restored"
FAL_princess_wins_election_desc:0 "Despite d'Artiglio's machinations, Falcor's most influential have given the monarchy one more chance. Pray that the Princess is steadfast and resolute enough to steer the listing ship that is our nation. Much remains to be done in order to drag Falcor out of the quagmire."

FAL_shattered_nation:0 "United We Must Stand"
FAL_shattered_nation_desc:0 "Now is not the time for squabbles nor arguments, Falcorians must stand together to reclaim what is theirs. Everygriffon regardless of their political alignment or belief must unite to have a chance at reclaiming our city, and giving the nation a way to resolve its problems."

FAL_loss_of_falcor:0 "Our Beautiful City"
FAL_loss_of_falcor_desc:0 "The city of Falcor isn't just a heap of buildings connected by roads. It is the source of our culture, our national pride, and everything that comes with it. Our older citizens fondly remember the days strolling through the Market Square, visiting the Royal Palace, and going to the local theatre. Remind the griffons that we will return."

FAL_recover_war:0 "Commence Rebuilding Efforts"
FAL_recover_war_desc:0 "Much of our nation lies underdeveloped and neglected. To give our citizens something to be happy about, we shall commence a project aimed to increase the amount of housing in Falcor. Hopefully, it will get most of the griffons out from the streets."

FAL_calm_revanchists:0 "Mollify Radicals"
FAL_calm_revanchists_desc:0 "The revanchists' hearts are in a good place, but their methods are crude and would only doom Falcor. However, we need them to support our campaign, which means a series of concessions will have to be given to that demagogue, d'Artiglio. A compromise can and will be found."

FAL_promise_return_falcor:0 "Falcor Comes First"
FAL_promise_return_falcor_desc:0 "The crisis may have been avoided, but that does not change the situation at large. Nationalist or pacifist, everygriffon wants to see our beautiful city returned. The Princess shall promise to her people that Falcor will be reunited, no matter the cost. Hopefully, this will also calm the extremists so that they will cooperate with us."

FAL_no_friends:0 "Alone We Stand"
FAL_no_friends_desc:0 "Spurned by our would-be allies, as Wingbardy laughs at our protests. [FAL.GetNameDef] has little other options than to pursue its interests by war, lest the dissatisfied extremists plot to topple the government. We shall all work together to achieve this goal, to restore what is rightfully ours, and may Boreas look after us."

FAL_conscript_militias:0 "Levy the Militias"
FAL_conscript_militias_desc:0 "Rally the soldiers, rally the veterans, rally everygriffon! We cannot stand against the might of Wingbardy and their allies in quality, but what we can do is overwhelm them by numbers until a proper response is mustered. As long as everygriff has a weapon, even a primitive one, we stand a chance of success."

FAL_prepare_border_for_war:0 "Coordinate With Loyalists"
FAL_prepare_border_for_war_desc:0 "Many griffons who have remained in the city of Falcor long for our return, but there is little they can do about it, as they are closely monitored. However, we shall instigate a diversion, which will allow these loyalists to cross the border and join our forces."

FAL_proper_training_for_militias:0 "Imperial Training"
FAL_proper_training_for_militias_desc:0 "Falcorians fight with enthusiasm and dedication, but that cannot replace proper training and drill. The old Empire to the north has a surplus of military advisors, many of which would happily instruct our soldiers for a small compensation."

FAL_fight_falcor:0 "Defiant to the End"
FAL_fight_falcor_desc:0 "Our final attempts to negotiate a peaceful settlement have ended in a failure, and Falcor has no choice left but to prepare for an eventual war. We lack the means to project our force outside our borders, but that won't stop us to utilise all our advantages to fight a protractive defensive battle.

FAL_princess:0 "National Heroine"

nice_princess_birb_desc:0 "Crown Princess of the Falcorian realm and the Queen's only child, Maximilliana has led a difficult life. Rushed home from her boarding school after her mother grew weak and ill, she was forced to become the acting ruler at the age of 14, with only the assistance of a noble council who often had different ideas on what was best for Falcor during the tumultuous years after 989. In spite of many difficulties, the young Princess has navigated through the circumstances and brought the nation a relative degree of stability. She has even found love, in the form of a local noble named Alberto, who now acts as Prince-Consort, although he very rarely participates in politics.\n\nBut the peace was not meant to last. Over the years, a large number of griffons, veterans and exiles from the war, have begun clamouring for retribution to what they perceived as Wingbardian tyranny. Thus they threaten the monarchy's rule, with their protests and strikes, and a large number of bystanders supports their side. Princess Maximilliana must find a way to placate the extremists while dealing with a hostile foreign presence, lest the line of Falcor extinguishes."
revenge_fucking_now_desc:0 "Former colonel in the Falcorian army, Gabriele d'Artiglio has served with distinction in the war against Wingbardy. He took part in the battle of Asbolus Forest, where he was grievously wounded by an artillery shell. Dragged away from the battlefield, he could do nothing but hear news of imminent defeat, which prolonged his recovery, as he believed Falcor was just one battle away from achieving victory. To this day, he still blames neighbouring Sicameon for not intervening in their favour, although the truth is that they were unwilling to assist a despotic monarch. In spite of everything, d'Artiglio was personally commemorated by Queen Maximilliana for his valour and bravery.\n\nConsidered unfit to continue serving in the forces due to his crippled leg, d'Artiglio turned his personal attention to the arts. He became renowned for his poetry and paintings, although art critics have noted that his works were rather heavy on misery and gloom. Over the years, he became a rallying point for Falcor's many veterans and exiles, who likewise thought to have unfinished business with Wingbardy, and organised them into a paramilitary force. d'Artiglio has a personal distaste for the followers who have adopted the Herzlander dialect, believing it to be an unwieldy, ugly language unfit for literature. They are merely tolerated because of the need for unity and numbers.\n\nNow with the pacifist opposition removed, Gabriele d'Artiglio will go through any obstacle to achieve the dream of a restored Falcor, exacting swift retribution on all who have done his nation harm."

Fev_desc:0 "Erika von Feveros was born in the Herzland province of Angriver in the year 967, to a minor noble family in the logging business near the Scheißwald forest. Erika lived a content childhood. Her father also held a commission in the Angriver army as an artillery officer and one of her favorite pastimes was to listen to her father's tales of his time in the army.\n\nBut in 978 her life was turned upside down when chaos came to Angriver and Gerhart Bluhm's Republicans attempted their coup. With her having relatives to the south in Wingbardy, her family attempted to flee but were caught up in the new conflict with Falcor in 985, with her family being impacted by the disastrous campaign of the Wingbardian army. Unfortunately, her parents were killed as many of the civilian casualties of the conflict. With no money, no support, and nowhere to go, Erika signed up with the Falcorian army, taking part in their 987 offensive. Despite not being from Falcor, her achievements in both command and developing strategies had her receive praises from the Queen and honourary citizenship.\n\nWith her charismatic demeanor and adapt command of griffons, she rose up the command ladder, following in her father’s footsteps to command artillery in the conflict. She emphasises the tactics of attack and the concentrated use of firepower to back up the offensives of the regular soldier. Always one to have a mug of ale in claw she hasn't grown rusty over the years and remains once more as one of Falcor’s primary commanders.\n"What you need, is a good piece of ordnance." - Erika "Queen of Shells""
