### Leader Descriptions ###
## Equestria ##
# Leaders #
POLITICS_CELESTIA_DESC:0 "Older than anyone would dare guess, Princess Celestia is an Alicorn, the eldest of the two Royal Sisters, and head ruler of Equestria. Additionally, she is responsible for the raising and lowering the sun, working in tandem with her sister Luna to ensure a stable night and day cycle. She is perhaps the most beloved creature in the world, being a staunch proponent for peace, kindness and cooperation. Very little of her past before Celestia’s victory over Discord is known, except that she and Luna discovered the Elements of Harmony. With these artefacts and their bearers, Princess Celestia has secured a long, relative peace for the nation."
POLITICS_DAYBREAKER_DESC:0 "Daybreaker is the pompous alternate ego of Celestia. Daybreaker is considerably arrogant, power-hungry, and known for being filled with rage. She boasts that she doesn't need Luna or anyone else, claims that she should have destroyed Luna instead of banishing her to the moon. Daybreaker dismisses the notions of balance and harmony in favor of ruling over all, in a single state under her iron hoof. Daybreaker harnesses more of the sun's power than Celestia does, allowing her to breathe fire and generate intense, burning light."

## Changeling ##
# Leaders #

POLITICS_CHRYSALIS_DESC:0  "Ruler and despot of the Changeling Hives, Queen Chrysalis has been itching for revenge for several years now. Her people have always teetered on the edge of famine, and their unique dietary needs necessitated a hostile takeover of what had appeared to be the easiest target. Chrysalis herself replaced Princess Cadence and had fooled nearly everyone, and had even bested Princess Celestia. It was by mere fluke that her victory was snatched away from her grasp and her people banished to the frozen North. Clearly infiltration alone is not enough to reclaim what is rightfully hers, and Chrysalis recognises the need of a powerful and modern military. Only by uniting the Hives by force and persuasion will she have the numbers. Now, with the might of the Hives, Chrysalis finally has the opportunity to enact the vengeance that she and her people have longed for so long."


## Dragon Tribe ##
# Leaders #
POLITICS_CRIMSON_DESC:0 "On the mountain, Crimson "Ruby" Hayden has watched as Dragons fought over wealth, distrscted by materialism. From early fights and violence between her kind being observed by her, she began to grow a hatred to the Dynasty. After a visit to Stalliongrad, her thoughts began to radicalize, forming the DFCP in 1007 with nationalist, Communist principles. Haydenism is now a popular thought contrast to traditional dragon thought."

## Polar Bears ##
# Leaders #
POLITICS_PWELLINGTON_DESC:0 "Paw Wellington had emerged as the despot of the fractured polar communities in 1002. Under his reign, the polar bears have finally organized into a civil society. He is remarked as being firm but fair, willing to share the fish and having soft paws. Since his rise to power, the bears have seen rather decent success."

## Pinguins ##

## Yakistan ##
# Leaders #
POLITICS_PRINCERUTHERFORD_DESC:0 "Beyond the Crystal Mountains, Prince Rutherford leads a proud nation of Yaks. Prince Rutherford is the disputed ruler of the traditionally isolationist Yaks, and has only recently begun to enter the global scene. This entry resulted in a nearly disastrous diplomatic event, which almost brought the underdeveloped nation of Yakyakistan into a war with Equestria. Luckily, Pinkie Pie - Equestria's own Element of Laughter - was able to step in and prevent the situation from spiralling out of control. Since the incident, Prince Rutherford has become committed to bringing his kingdom out of its current dark ages, and into an age of prosperity. Rutherford is willing to do just about anything for his people, provided it does not come at the expense of the Yaks' pride."

## Jakistan ##
# Leaders #
POLITICS_PRINCEBRADFORD_DESC:0 "To the East of the internationally recognized country of Yakyakistan, Prince Bradford holds claim over a clan of Yaks whom call themselves the 'Jaki-Clan.' A long-time rival of his brother, Prince Rutherford of Yakyakistan, Bradford simply wishes for his Yaks - or Jaks, depending on who you ask - to be left alone. Unfortunately for Bradford, with tensions rising with the Changelings to the West, the Griffons to the East, and Prince Rutherford practically breathing down its neck, the Jaki-Clan finds itself in a precarious position.

## Crystal Empre ##
# Leaders #
POLITICS_CADENZA_DESC:0 "Princess Mi Amore Cadenza, better known as Cadence, is another Alicorn Princess, though she began life as a Pegasus. After overcoming a jealous sorceress by opening her heart to her, Cadence was elevated into Alicornhood and joined Luna and Celestia in the Equestrian Royal Family as the Princess of Love. There she fell in love with a young Shining Armour, and married him. Unfortunately, their wedding was used by the Changeling Queen, Chrysalis, to overthrow the Royal Family and take over Equestria. With the power of their love, Shining Armour and Cadence managed to thwart the invasion and repelled the Changeling forces out of the country. After some time, Cadence was installed as the leader of the Crystal Empire and has since safekept it along with her husband."
POLITICS_SOMBRA_DESC:0 "Sombra’s origins are as mysterious as the mere mention of his name is unsettling. Whatever memories of his past have long been forgotten, perhaps even by himself. What is known of him and his rule over the Crystal Empire paints a grim picture: as King, he enslaved and tortured his own subjects to further his powers. He was only stopped when he was banished by Princess Celestia and Luna over a thousand years ago, along with his empire. When he returned, Sombra had become an immaterial creature of shadow, and threatened to take over the Crystal Empire once more were it not for the combined efforts of Princess Cadence and the Bearers of the Elements of Harmony. His form might have been gone, but his essence remained. This pony might not be the Sombra of the past, but he is just as cruel and tyrannical as the tales describe. One thing is sure: the King is back."
