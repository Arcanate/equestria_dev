POLITICS_CELESTIA_DESC:0 "Princess Celestia is an Alicorn pony, the head ruler of the Equestrian lands, alongside her younger sister: Princess Luna. Celestia is the adoptive aunt of Princess Cadance, an Alicorn of the Crystal Empire. In addition to her responsibility of raising the sun to bring dawn, she has also been the teacher of Twilight Sparkle and Sunset Shimmer. Her alternate ego is Daybreaker, a powerful Alicorn who uses much of the Sun's energy to project power. Celestia is a beloved Alicorn, mostly due to her peaceful policy, kindness, effeciency and relaxed manner. Before Princess Luna and she stood up to Discord, a spirit of Disharmony, he ruled over Equestria, keeping it in a state of unrest and unhappiness. She and Luna discovered the Elements of Harmony and defeated Discord, turning him to stone. Celestia has also fought against Nightmare Moon, Chrysalis and many other figures, in order to spread a global sphere of Harmony."
POLITICS_DAYBREAKER_DESC:0 "Daybreaker is the pompous alternate ego of Celestia. Daybreaker is considerably arrogant, power-hungry, and known for being filled with rage. She boasts that she doesn't need Luna or anyone else, claims that she should have destroyed Luna instead of banishing her to the moon. Daybreaker dismisses the notions of balance and harmony in favor of ruling over all, in a single state under her iron hoof. Daybreaker harnesses more of the sun's power than Celestia does, allowing her to breathe fire and generate intense, burning light."
