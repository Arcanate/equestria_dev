TRO_CTH_BATNOAM_ZARZA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 5th of May, 971 in Kizil-Zeb\n\n§YRank§!: Generalissimo Of The United Republican Front\n\n§YBiography§!:Batnoam Zarza should not be where he is today. Nothing in his life has lead him to this moment, and no gods placed their favor on him. Everything he has gained has been down to pure personal guile and opportunism, and he wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nBorn to a middle class Coltvan landowner, Zarza spent his entire early life trying to escape the condition of his Coltvan birth. His father had tried for years to earn the respect given to any Colthaginian of his status, but he was looked down upon as nothing more than a country hick. Zarza would continue his father's objective by doing all the dirty deeds asked of him by the local Colthaginian government, eventually earning a reputation as a ruthless, and mildly competent fixer. He enrolled in a local military academy and received an officer's commission thanks to his work as a grunt, and a decently sized bribe.\n\nThe one time Zarza made use of his Coltvan heritage was when the Storm King invaded Colthage. He met up with general Zoblos and they hid in the jungles of the eastern province, committing horrid reprisals on Storm King and coltvan rebel forces alike. Though it should be noted, he never won a battle he personally led.\n\nFollowing the liberation of Colthage, he returned to his simple fixer work in the eastern regions, until the revolt of Zeshmunazash Zeirutid. Working with the militarist forces, he helped plan the meeting that would turn into a death trap for the Coltvan rebel, which in his eyes, finally liberated him from the legacy of that jungle slum of a prefecture. However, he didn't see Zarishat coming.\n\nLeading a resistance against her regime, he managed to gather to him cartel and constitutionalist forces that he could use as a blunt weapon against the second Zeirutid sibling. Succeeding in toppling her regime, he could never have predicted the chaos that now engulfs his land. But has he always has, he'll come out on top by making a few more deals.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Egil"
