trotkart_colthage.1.d:0 "#TODO - Generally introducing Zarza and all that jazz, generally should focus on his internal thoughts about the entire third civil war shortly following the official declaration of resistance which was made following a rather inspiring speech to his mish mash of an army."
trotkart_colthage.1.a:0 "I'll show them a country bumpkin..."

trotkart_colthage.2.t:0 "The Knights Of The Modern Era"
trotkart_colthage.2.d:0 "#TODO - The various mercenary leaders Zarza and his allies hired talking at the pub discussing the wonderful business opportunity they've been provided with - None of them particularly like each other and are really only working for Zarza because he is paying a King's ransom, but the one thing they all have in common is the fact that they quite frankly don't care about Colthage at all"
trotkart_colthage.2.a:0 "To profit and a good death!"

trotkart_colthage.3.t:0 "Yet Another Cog"
trotkart_colthage.3.d:0 "#TODO - Azizelquart Zahummid in his office crunching the numbers and realising just how bad the economic situation is for the United Republican Front. After some deliberation he quitely makes a note to set aside a fund for himself so he can defect to Monzano if she wins the civil war while also keeping the books even to make sure no one suspects a thing."
trotkart_colthage.3.a:0 "I managed to fix Zarishat's books..."

trotkart_colthage.4.t:0 "Sentimientos"

trotkart_colthage.5.t:0 "A Leech Among Leeches"
trotkart_colthage.5.d:0 "#TODO - Flavour event about Zaalisillhek Bodzathart - A very rich and extremely corrupt landowner aligned with Trotkart, meeting up with his fellow landlords and industrialists in Zebinop, as they plot to basically turn Colthage into a kleptocracy under the guise of economic modernisation - Overall the entire event is covered in a thin veneer of politeness and petty pleasantries"

trotkart_colthage.6.t:0 "A Port In The Storm"
trotkart_colthage.6.d:0 "#TODO - Jebzel Zoblos metting with Zarza in private as she's technically his most loyal subordinate - He basically explains to her that he will need her assistance in reforming the military after the war and keeping the mercenaries in check, so he wants her to keep her war crime tendencies in check so he has ammunition against the mercs after the Civil War is over - In the end she does agree to do so "
trotkart_colthage.6.a:0 "I'll do my best"

trotkart_colthage.7.t:0 "Boundless Optimism"
trotkart_colthage.7.d:0 "#TODO - Zuan Khilletzbaal, the student that appears in Zarishat and Zesh's university events finding his calling as a minor politician, provided he's had to cancel his university studies owing to the whole Third and Second Civil War thing, but he basically acts as a representative to the new "Young" Scientifics, who are Japanese style Liberals."

### Leader Descriptions ###
TRO_CTH_BATNOAM_ZARZA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 5th of May, 971 in Kizil-Zeb\n\n§YRank§!: Generalissimo Of The United Republican Front\n\n§YBiography§!:Batnoam Zarza should not be where he is today. Nothing in his life has lead him to this moment, and no gods placed their favor on him. Everything he has gained has been down to pure personal guile and opportunism, and he wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nBorn to a middle class Coltvan landowner, Zarza spent his entire early life trying to escape the condition of his Coltvan birth. His father had tried for years to earn the respect given to any Colthaginian of his status, but he was looked down upon as nothing more than a country hick. Zarza would continue his father's objective by doing all the dirty deeds asked of him by the local Colthaginian government, eventually earning a reputation as a ruthless, and mildly competent fixer. He enrolled in a local military academy and received an officer's commission thanks to his work as a grunt, and a decently sized bribe.\n\nThe one time Zarza made use of his Coltvan heritage was when the Storm King invaded Colthage. He met up with general Zoblos and they hid in the jungles of the eastern province, committing horrid reprisals on Storm King and coltvan rebel forces alike. Though it should be noted, he never won a battle he personally led.\n\nFollowing the liberation of Colthage, he returned to his simple fixer work in the eastern regions, until the revolt of Zeshmunazash Zeirutid. Working with the militarist forces, he helped plan the meeting that would turn into a death trap for the Coltvan rebel, which in his eyes, finally liberated him from the legacy of that jungle slum of a prefecture. However, he didn't see Zarishat coming.\n\nLeading a resistance against her regime, he managed to gather to him cartel and constitutionalist forces that he could use as a blunt weapon against the second Zeirutid sibling. Succeeding in toppling her regime, he could never have predicted the chaos that now engulfs his land. But has he always has, he'll come out on top by making a few more deals.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Egil"
