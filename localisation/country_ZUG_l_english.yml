ZUG_earth_celebration:0 "End the Celebration"
ZUG_earth_celebration_desc:0 "The yearly festival to calm the ancestral spirits and celebrate our Earth's birthday are coming to close. All across the land, the subjects of the enlightened Nnabakyala Mukisa gather to hear her heralds in the villages whilst the capital awaits for her appearance."

ZUG_address_fears:0 "Fear of New"
ZUG_address_fears_desc:0 "The sad fact is that Ugabi is leagues backwards compared to the northern and western realms. But even as some small innovations have arrived to the state this development has caused alarm in the population. Mukisa must address these feelings."

ZUG_modern_innovations:0 "The Wonder Tool"
ZUG_modern_innovations_desc:0 "Motorized vehicles are nothing new to the Ugabi population. But what was once seen as but a weapon of war has seen a new development in the form of a tractor in the fields. Seeing the success and popularity of the new tool, Mukisa will export more of them and gift them to the people at her own expense."

ZUG_western_railroad:0 "The Western Railroad"
ZUG_western_railroad-desc:0 "Kamarela-Ruguzu railroad; what had once been a dear project of her father lays still in ruins, destroyed and razed by the Storm King's invasion. Mukisa had always desired to rebuild it but UCTA's control of the western region has made this impossible. If she even did rebuild it, what would stop the military from taking control of it? But with the Summit approaching, the railroad could prove an useful tool against the military."

ZUG_eastern_fields:0 "The Eastern Marshes"
ZUG_eastern_fields_desc:0 "In Kargaweze most of the land is made up of useless marshes. For decades there have been plans to drain these lands so that they might be used for farming but nothing has come to fruition so far. These broken promises have garnered ill will amongst the locals, leading to many to support the Gulu clique. Mukisa will openly declare that it is in her plans to finally see the swamps be drained."

ZUG_industrious_subjects:0 "Celebrate the Industrious Subjects"
ZUG_industrious_subjects_desc:0 "While we might be backwards in eyes of the world there are those in Ugabi who have not remained idle. These forward thinking zebras and their work should be remembered."

ZUG_farmers_to_workers:0 "Protect the Labourers"
ZUG_farmers_to_workers_desc:0 "One of the main issues hailed by the Gulu clique is the rights of labourers for fair rents and laws that protect them from abuse by their landlords. On the paper these are fair and just demands but these issues have been turned into weapons against Mukisa's rightful reign by the so-called reformers. It is best to disarm them at once."

ZUG_enflame_western_unrest:0 "Spread Whispers in the West"
ZUG_enflame_western_unrest_desc:0 "Western Ugabi lay in ruin and unrest under the tyrannical hoof of the UCTA. The soldiers do nothing but harass villages and commit crimes without fear of any punishment. Any protests have been quelled violently. But Mukisa knows her subjects will act if called upon, and the time for that approaches."

ZUG_discredit_clique:0 "Discredit the Clique"
ZUG_discredit_clique_desc:0 "The Gulu clique claim to be acting for the sake of common zebra. In truth, they are nothing but an opportunist lot who seek power for the sake of power like the UCTA. Mukisa will let her subjects know the truth so they will know to whom their loyalty should belong to."

ZUG_sway_key_reformers:0 "Meet the Reasonable Zebras"
ZUG_sway_key_reformers_desc:0 "A letter has arrived to Mukisa through one of her spies. It is a request for a secretive meeting by a group of reformers who wish to parlay with her in good faith. This is a chance Mukisa will accept."

ZUG_entice_traders:0 "Entice the Traders"
ZUG_entice_traders_desc:0 "The desolation brought by the Storm King left the old trade routes broken and brought ruination to old caravans. But a slow recovery has seen the trade network re-open and link Ugabi to the world at large. While it has brought wealth, it has also introduced dangerous foreign ideas that challenge the throne. To counter this, Mukisa will seek to align the traders to her reign with monopoly rights and luctrative tariff reliefs."

ZUG_court_parlays:0 "The Court of Nnabakyala"
ZUG_court_parlays_desc:0 "As part of her daily duties, Mukisa holds court in her royal palace. One part of this a public forum where any subject can appeal to her for justice or seek wisdom. Behind the throne, however, ears are kept open for any ill rumours while lavish meetings are held for the influential to keep them loyal to the throne."

ZUG_hear_merchants:0 "Hear the Merchants"
ZUG_hear_merchants_desc:0 "A group of merchants has recently appealed to the throne for an amend to an edict concerning foreign trade. Mukisa shall listen to what they'll have to say and pass her judgement."

ZUG_modern_friends:0 "To A New Friendship!"
ZUG_modern_friends_desc:0 "Even if part of the traditional elite, Mukisa can feel where the wind is blowing; the ascendance of merchants who are learned in modern arts has created a new powerbase without ancient lineages. An asset that would be most useful in the future."

ZUG_listen_nobles:0 "Host the Nobles"
ZUG_listen_nobles_desc:0 "Part of Mukisa's duties is to host lavish parties for the nobles to showcase her wealth and power. One such party has been planned, and Mukisa intends for this one to be especially grand."

ZUG_traditional_allies:0 "To A Continued Alliance!"
ZUG_traditional_allies_desc:0 "As the old proverb goes, one should not play with fire. The ancient clans and capital nobility are an established powerbase and it would be foolish to risk their ire. Instead, Mukisa will ensure their loyalty and friendship to secure her plans."

ZUG_royal_authority:0 "Power of the Throne"
ZUG_royal_authority_desc:0 "Ugabi might be an union of many clans but there is only one Nnabakyala — and her name is Mukisa."

ZUG_charitable_leader:0 "One Who Cares for All"
ZUG_charitable_leader_desc:0 "The Nnabakyala have always cared for their subjects but has there ever been such a charitable leader lie Mukisa? Her wealth has seen the poor fed, roads constructed and the fields expand across the land. Her wealth is Ugabi's wealth, one and the same."

ZUG_liberation_icon:0 "One Who Led the Liberation"
ZUG_liberation_icon_desc:0 "Ugabi would never have been freed without the work of the venerated Mukisa. It was she who created the armed forces who pushed the invaders out. It was she who freed the slaves from their chains. Without her, there would be no Ugbai today and she will let her subjects know this."

ZUG_ancestral_guidance:0 "One With the Ancestors"
ZUG_ancestral_guidance_desc:0 "As it was and shall be, the Nnabakyala acts as the link between the living and the dead. Her person unites the present, past and the future into one being. Who would dare to question such a vessel of wisdom?"

ZUG_repay_loyalty_desc:0 "TODO"

ZUG_royal_estates:0 "Loyal Subjects"
ZUG_royal_estates_desc:0 "Much land across Ugabi belongs to the throne and most are occupied by local farming communities.

ZUG_visible_monarchy:0 "Modern Approach"
ZUG_visible_monarchy_desc:0 "Mukisa has seen fit to become more approachable to her subjects all across Ugabi. While for years she has held festivals in the capital that have been commemorated by heralds in her name, she now wishes to speak to the directly with the help of modern technology."

ZUG_popular_sovereign:0 "Popular Sovereignty"
ZUG_popular_sovereign_desc:0 "No ruler cannot rule if their subjects oppose them. Mukisa has come to realize the power she can gain by garnering the support of her subjects directly instead of through the traditional chieftains. While they may retain their positions, the throne will become closer to its subjects and earn their unquestioning devotion."

ZUG_damned_traitors_desc:0 "TODO"

ZUG_divine_agents:0 "Loyal Priesthood"
ZUG_divine_agents_desc:0 "Of all the factions in Ugabi, the priests of the Sky and various other religious officials remain staunchly loyal to Mukisa and the institution she stands for. Some have already taken the initiative to wield their influence over the masses by preaching loyalty to their Nnabakyala and how one must be ready to even cast aside their chieftains if they are to oppose her rule. Such forward thinking must be repaid."

ZUG_watchful_spirits:0 "Watchful Spirits"
ZUG_watchful_spirits_desc:0 "Us mortals cannot escape attention of our forebears even after their depature. They watch and protect us. Yet they also punish the wicked and cruel. To betray the Nnabakyala is a crime against the Sky himself and the traitor's soul is cast aside by the winds upon death, never to exist again. Who would risk such damnation?"

ZUG_blessed_dynasty:0 "Blessed By the God"
ZUG_blessed_dynasty_desc:0 "It is clear that the Sky favours Nnabakyala Mukisa. Her dynasty has ruled Ugabi since time immemorial, surviving while other rulers and clans have been vanquished. Now, she stands above all as a divinely ordained ruler, one who speaks with voice of countless ancestors and is connected to the god himself. To serve her is a privilege and every devout subject stands ready to fulfill her commands."

ZUG_absolutism:0 "My Name is Mukisa"
ZUG_absolutism_desc:0 "Ugabi is nothing without its ruler, and that ruler is Mukisa. Anyone who dares to oppose her rule is nothing but a filthy traitor who should be opposed at all costs. Her subjects are devoted to her and know that under her rule they will see Ugabi rise in glory over the others."

ZUG_plan_tour:0 "Announce the Royal Tour"
ZUG_plan_tour_desc:0 "Amidst the great stir over the upcoming Summer Summit, Mukisa has also declared her intention to tour the land and visit the local chieftains. This way will she not only bring the throne closer to the common zebra but also allow her to convince the chieftains to support her in the future."

ZUG_give_gifts:0 "Give Generous Gifts"

ZUG_invite_into_royal_guard:0 "Recruit the Bravest and Strongest"
ZUG_invite_into_royal_guard_desc:0 "The royal Horn Guardians are the traditional household soldiers of the Nnabakyala, meant to protect both the royal family and the Golden Horn. But after Storm King's invasion the guard were left in disgrace due to loss of the ancient artifact. But with some incentives and flattery, Mukisa will see more recruits join its ranks."

ZUG_expand_traditional_rights:0 "Expand Traditional Clan Rights and Lands"
ZUG_expand_traditional_rights_desc:0 "As a show of well-being and benelovence Mukisa will expand the traditional rights given to the named clans of Ugabi and gift royal lands to them. In truth, however, most of the rights will be rather superficial, dealing only in specific local matters, and the lands are mostly backwater territories currently unused."

ZUG_commemorate_liberation:0 "Commemorate Liberation "
ZUG_commemorate_liberation_desc:0 "Ugabi is a free realm and answers to no foreign overlord. But this freedom was not truly achieved by our own strenght; the original invasion by the Storm King's saw light casualties but also loss of the Golden Horn whereas the later 'liberation' spearheaded by the UCTA simply removed the few yeti garrisons and secured our borders. Truth, however, matters little to her subjects and a beautiful lie serves a better purpose for Mukisa."

ZUG_sudden_visit:0 "At the Barracks"
ZUG_sudden_visit_desc:0 "The Ugabi Central Territorial Army might be united by their belief of superioirity they are, in reality, fractured into multiple power groups, each ruled by a powerful officer. While some are large, others are small. One of these smaller forces, however, happens to be located quite close to the capital and Mukisa has seen fit to pay them a visit."

ZUG_secure_arms:0 "Tactics and Gunpowder"
ZUG_secure_arms_desc:0 "Courage and will alone will not win battles. Modern warfare has no room for the old ways. Something that the accursed UCTA has proven time and again. But a question remains; why let them have the monopoly to this power?"

ZUG_eastern_spies:0 "Pay Attention to the East"
ZUG_eastern_spies_desc:0 "It is important to not ignore the Gulu Clique's military assets either. Rumours speak of hidden arms caches in the swamps that are ready to be wielded by an army of revolutionaries blinded by their own self-righteousness. Even if the truth may be stretched, it would be foolish to not heed them."

ZUG_host_military_officers:0 "Host the Honourable Officers"
ZUG_host_military_officers_desc:0 "A recent announcement has raised quite a few eyebrows across Ugabi. Mukisa has seen fit to hold a banquet at the capital dedicated entirely to honouring the achievements of the UCTA. On the guest list are officers from the military and amongst them is a particular marshall Mukisa is keen to have a talk with."

### Power struggle events

zugstart.1.t:0 "Her Vision"
zugstart.1.d:0 "Event where Mukisa is led to the ceremonial platform by the royal entourage whilst the crowds cheer. There she holds a speech declaring the festivals to be done and, as per tradition, what her vision (essentially what the visiting spirit of the previous Nnabakyala, her father, showed her). In it she saw Ugabi be ravaged by storms and earthquakes, only to give away to a city of gold. She explains that this must mean that Ugabi will face difficult times in the following year but that, in the end, all will be better. After this she plays her role as Nnabakyala and blows the ceremonial horn (replacement one, as the original was taken by the Storm King) which is followed by a spectacular fireworks show, awing the crowds."
zugstart.1.a:0 "Three cheers to our Nnabakyala!"

zugstart.2.t:0 "Tumultuous Spring"
zugstart.2.d:0 "Follow-up event where Mukisa is in her private parlour, reading reports about the military expanding bandit hnting activities to yet another village (read as them just beginning to extort it) and a certain high ranking Gulu clique reformer has escaped house captivity. Mukisa essentially explains to herself and the player the tumultuous political situation Ugabi is in and how either the military or the Gulu clique can move her aside if they gain the power and popularity. To counter this, she has a plan. She will summon the Clans to a summit in the early summer where she will call upon them to reneve their oaths to her and therefore enforce her authority publicly to the nation. However, she will need to cement her position over the spring and make sure neither faction will be powerful enough to oppose her. If Mukisa plays her cards right, then she will be truly in charge of Ugabi."
zugstart.2.a:0 "Let the game begin."

zugstart.3.t:0 "Unfounded Fears"
zugstart.3.d:0 "In the event Mukisa is walking outside the capital on one of her fields where a Maregyptian tractor is being shown to her by a pony engineer. Her royal entourage whisper in the back while further away commoners watch the happening. In her mind Mukisa wonders why there is such a fuzz over such a simple machine but she knows the commoner fears the machines due to the military using them for war. She asks the engineer if anyone can drive such a machine. Given a yes, she tells a guard to fetch the oldest commoner in the crowd. That commoner is then ordered by Mukisa to climb onto the tractor alongside the pony engineer. After a while, the vehicle comes active and begins to drive, operated by the old zebra. This should break fear amongst the common masses, who now look in amazement, especially as the tractor breaks the soil so easily."
zugstart.3.a:0 "A tool is a tool, and nothing more."

zugstart.4.t:0 "An Unusual Strike"
zugstart.4.d:0 "A backfire event for the railroad scheme. Essentially, local workers are refusing to work citing bad work conditions, In reality, some soldiers from the UCTA are holding them back, wanting to be paid. But giving them pay would mean a public humiliation whereas not paying them will stall production, leading to further costs for the royal treasure, even more than the bribe demanded."
zugstart.4.a:0 "§RJust give them the damned gift to make them go.§!"
zugstart.4.b:0 "YRPWe must bide our time for now.§!"

zugstart.5.t:0 "Report Review"
zugstart.5.d:0 "A backfire event where the comission sent to review and plan the drainign process. It has, however, become obvious that there's been serious misscalculations done; it is simply impossible to fulfill the lofty goals with the current budget. This leaves Mukisa with two options; either she downscales her plans but raise ire of the locals, certainly making some go back to the Gulu faction, or increase the comission's budget from her own wealth."
zugstart.5.a:0 "§OPerhaps some plans can be backscaled?§!"
zugstart.5.b:0 "YRDip into the royal treasury to fulfil the plans.§!"

zugstart.6.t:0 "An Evening Story"
zugstart.6.d:0 "In the event a griot finishes telling a tale in a Western Ugabian village. Afterwards, she continues on to tell about Mukisa, her wealth and fierce prowess. How her rule is wise and just. Essentially tells propaganda of her reign, and how the locals should never forget how their Nnabakyala is still their rightful overlord. Should cause some to leave, out of fear for reprisals from the military while others, silently, avert her gaze. She should make a mental note at the end how she needs to leave when everyone's asleep, or risk meeting end of a barrel the coming morning."
zugstart.6.a:0 "Thankless work, even if for a good pay."

zugstart.7.t:0 "Claims Gone Too Far"
zugstart.7.d:0 "A backfire event where the rumours meant to discredit and ruin image of the Gulu reformers has spilled over to Mukisa's own faction; an influential court noble is accused of being a foul cultist due to a past association to a Gulu reformer accused of being one too. By law this should lead to a trial by the temple, so that the accused is either punished or proven innocent. Problem is that Mukisa knows this noble's daughter is also a member in the military and her spies say he plans to escape to the military's camp if a trial is arranged. But if she does not follow up on charge, she will be seen as weak and unjust, favouring her courtiers over the laws."
zugstart.7.a:0 "§YSay nothing on the matter.§!"
zugstart.7.b:0 "§gArrange for a trial.§!"

zugstart.8.t:0 "Clandestine Meeting"
zugstart.8.d:0 "In the event Mukisa has a meeting with two important Gulu reformers who have come to parlay with her. In return for implementing certain reforms and decrees in the future, she will have their support. Mukisa should bark back, calling some of them such as an elected assembly an affront to her God's blessed rule. She counters by admitting that she sees wisdom in some of their wishes, even going as far as calling them true Ugabians for daring to oppose her to see Ugabi rise. But she calls them fools for forgetting to whom the right to rule belongs and how their ideas of collective rule will simply give rise to anarchy. She tells them that she will agree to heed their advice in the future and raise them to be her councillors. The two ultimately agree to her, severly culling Gulu Clique's leadership."
zugstart.8.a:0 "A fruitful discussion."

zugstart.9.t:0 "Love and Lust"
zugstart.9.d:0 "An event where Mukisa's day in the court is overwhelmed by a fierce debate over an incident that had occured in the capital. Two zebras ended up in a drunken argument over some shared love interest, over which they ended up having a fight over that spilled over into a massive group-on-group riot. Issue for Mukisa is, however, that both defendants come from her rivalling factions and while supporting one will lower influence of the loosing faction it will also increase influence of the winner's side. But as the room comes to a silence, Mukisa must make a choice."
zugstart.9.a:0 "§OThe officer caused this entire situation.§!"
zugstart.9.b:0 "§gChieftain's daughter was in the wrong.§!"

zugstart.10.t:0 "Gift Baskets"
zugstart.10.d:0 "An event where a remote village in the backskirts is awoken to a visit by Nnabakyala's dignitaries. They announce that Mukisa is very pleased with the village's dedication to duty and loyalty, citing their bountiful harvests, on-time taxes and merit gained by some zebras originally from the village. The officials then begin to hand out baskets full of food, cloth linen, money, tools and other needed commodities."
zugstart.10.a:0 "Loyalty to one's better will bring due rewards."

zugstart.11.t:0 "Reforged Spirits"
zugstart.11.d:0 "An event where a border village close to UCTA's lands is being harassed and extorted by a platoon of soldiers. This time, however, the villagers are less subdued. Not so meek. This makes the leading officer curious, who happens to spot one elderly granny just chuckling and demands to know what is funny. The old mare replies and says that times are changing. That once again, Ugabi will be ruled by old laws and God's blessing. How the land will thrive after a cleansing fire. This irks the officer, who spats backs and calls her a deranged hag. A villager takes a step forward, only to be violently shoved back with a rifle. The old mare, irregardless, keeps on laughing and even as the soldiers depart on top their car, the laughter seems to trail after them."
zugstart.11.a:0 "What a loony granny."

zugstart.12.t:0 "Divine Right"
zugstart.12.d:0 "An event where a remote village in the backskirts all the villagers have gathered to see and listen to a travelling priest bearing standard of the Nnabakyala. She tells them how the ancestral spirits are restless and angry. For they see Ugabi suffering from disloyalty and greed. Where zebras no longer heed call of the God and the sovereign God has put to rule over the land. These spirits will not rest, until Ugabi will once again stand behind God's chosen, the one who speaks with the spirits. All good subjects must heed this call, for only damnation and ruination will await those who oppose."
zugstart.12.a:0 "So wills God!"

zugstart.13.t:0 "Dreadful Drill"
zugstart.13.d:0 "An event telling about some new recruit's morning training in the UCTA at some fort in western Ugabi. Mood and sprits are particularly low, as despite a limited lockdown by the officers they have all heard the same; Curse Tablets bearing marks cursing all the traitors and enemies of Ugabi. The recruit in question recalls the horror she'd seen in her village, how her former neighbours and even own family acted like she was some accursed being. Their looks haunt her sleep and make her doubt. But a swift lash strike from an officer brings her out from daydreaming and focus back on the drills."
zugstart.13.a:0 "I need a drink."

zugstart.14.t:0 "Royal Splendour"
zugstart.14.d:0 "An event about a royal parade being organised in the capital to the awe of the people. At first not all too out of the ordinary but Mukisa's appearance shatters this; unlike her normal appearance, she is now clad in ceremonial armor, with her face painted in blue like the Ugabian rulers don in their ascension ceremony. She also wield the Pearl Sword, an ancient sword that was gifted to the hero Ekitala by God to beat back the cold demons and united the Ugabian tribes. Mukisa is descendant of this hero."
zugstart.14.a:0 "All hail!"

zugstart.15.t:0 "Seat of Honour"
zugstart.15.d:0 "An event about an evening dinner party in the countryside after the royal tour draws to its conclusion. However, a rather peculiar scene has developed towards the evening between some military officials and elite associated with the Gulu Clique. They are fighting over the honour of sitting besides Mukisa. Whilst Mukisa knows the tour has been a success and will see her position elevate, having either party gain a place of honour in this dinner party will leech some of that success, elevating their side's popularity. But she will have to choose her poison with a smile."
zugstart.15.a:0 "§gHonourable officer.§!"
zugstart.15.b:0 "§OMost gracious chieftain.§!"

zugstart.16.t:0 "The War Cry"
zugstart.16.d:0 "An event where Mukisa, in a place of honour, receives various Ugabian warbands at a field just outside the capital. The warriors recant to her their deeds and brave acts whilst others fight mock battles against one another to gain the honour to approach Mukisa. The royal court gawk and praise Mukisa's name, as she rewards the greatest warriors with gold and silver. However, Mukisa is far more interested in seeing cracks in the smiles of some Gulu allied chieftains, as their warriors in particular are picked out by Mukisa fo gifts and rewards, in a way swaying their loyalty away from their chieftains and to the royal sovereign instead."
zugstart.16.a:0 "True warrior is not only brave but loyal too."

zugstart.17.t:0 "Sullen Oath"
zugstart.17.d:0 "An event where a serious incident threatens the court. For onw of the recent recruits to the new royal guard is, in reality, a deserter from the UCTA and the regiment he is from has issued a formal request to have them be handed over. By the law, the deserter should be handed over to the regiment but this would showcase power of the UCTA while keeping him would break the law and therefore sullen Mukisa's image."
zugstart.17.a:0 "§gLaw is law, give them the deserter.§!"
zugstart.17.b:0 "§YNo.§!"

zugstart.18.t:0 "Serious Charge"
zugstart.18.d:0 "An event where Mukisa find herself sitting upon her seat whilst a delegation of various chieftains are paying their respects to her. But in middle of it all, a group of officers interrupt the affair to level an accusation at one chieftain for crime of betraying Ugabi and harbouring bandits. The chieftain rejects these claims as lies and fabrications. Irregardless of the truth, Mukisa finds herself with two choices; either accept the charge levelled and apprehend the chieftain, which would break Gulu unity but elevate UCTA's position, or reject the charges, showcasing her own authority but also publicly defending a Gulu supporter."
zugstart.18.a:0 "§gApprehend the accused for proper investigation.§!"
zugstart.18.b:0 "§OThis is just hearsay, nothing more.§!"

zugstart.19.t:0 "Claims Gone Too Far"
zugstart.19.d:0 "A backfire event where Mukisa stands in the rain, inspecting the lined soldiers of the UCTA at some barracks whilst an officer stands in a solemn salute. It doesn't escape Mukisa that the officer harbors no love for her, as she is a known closet-socialist, even as far as rumouredly blaspheming the spirits and God. Issue is that now, after a ceremony where many officers were commemorated and gifted with enough gold to be sure of a shifted loyalty, only this one officer remains. But as Mukisa is about to gift this socialist officer, she surprised Mukisa by bowing and requesting a God's blessing instead. This presents an issue to Mukisa however; as a warrior the officer is perfectly in her right to request it however the blessing would mark the warrior as spiritually healthy, something she is not and it is an open-secret. It'd make a fool of Mukisa. But if she were to refuse the offer that would be seen as a slight, playing into the belief within UCTA that Mukisa does not care for them at all and is only interested at the old ways."
zugstart.19.a:0 "§YGold and silver for you.§!"
zugstart.19.b:0 "§gThe spirits shall watch over you.§!"

zugstart.20.t:0 "Gathering the Clues"
zugstart.20.d:0 "An event about an interrigation of a Gulu agent by two royal agents of Mukisa in some hut in eastern Ugabi. The agents want to know more about the arms stashed in the swamps, who smuggled them in and who are his partners. The agent interrogated should refuse and the royal agents are left with no choice but to start emplying harder methods. Likely better these methods are simply implied until the agent begins to crack up."
zugstart.20.a:0 "Dirty but necessary work."

zugstart.21.t:0 "Secret Terror"
zugstart.21.d:0 "Special event if both events 6 and 20 are triggered. Following the recent undercover actions, rumours have grown abound about the royal agents sowing unrest and hunting down traitors of the throne. While these have all been a success so far, there has also been some unrest stirred about this, with some whispers calling Mukisa a tyrant. Mukisa can either continue the operations or dial them back to showcase her magnamous nature."
zugstart.21.a:0 "Disregard the unrest and continue the operations."
zugstart.21.b:0 "There will be mercy — for now."

zugstart.22.t:0 "At the Party"
zugstart.22.d:0 "In the event Mukisa is hosting a grand party for a host of UCTA officer, in particular to those from the faction led by Ekiso. He has the seat of honour, alongside some royal court higher-ups and his closest aides. But the two have some privacy, and they chat about past. How they had met once, at the ceremony before the to-be officers travelled to Saddle Arabia for training, how they returned only to see the blight of the Storm King but also how the Ugabians held out. In the end, Ekiso breaks the ice; he knows the UCTA is in a bad spot while Mukisa's tuhority is growing. He, therefore, offers to pledge his soldiers and allied regiments to her, under one condition. That being UCTA will be reformed, not disbanded. Mukisa should retort by saying Ekiso's faction does contain anti-royalist officers. To this, he does agree and offers to see them be disposed of. At least the ones not toeing the line. With this, Mukisa accepts and rises up to offer a toast to Ekiso before the crowds, cementing their alliance."
zugstart.22.a:0 "To friendship!"

### Summit Chaos event chain

zugchaos.1.t:0 "The Clans Gather"
zugchaos.1.d:0 "The starting event in the event chain for the political chaos; details how the clan chieftains, apart from some, have gathered at the royal palace for the summit. Meanwhile the otherwise bustling capital city has fallen oddly silent, as houses have been fortified, merchant stalls closed and the common people hide, as if expecting something. Tense rumours about the army mobilizing in the west and unlawful mob gatherings in the east have given a rise for alarm. Mukisa expected this and how only God knows what will happen in the following days."
zugchaos.1.a:0 "Time will show the answer."


### Mukisa victory

ZUG_mukisa_cause_strife_to_gulu:0 "Cause Strife Amongst Gulu Leadership"
ZUG_mukisa_cause_strife_to_gulu_desc:0 "While Gulu Clique may appear outwards as an united front, its leadership is filled with nobles and thinkers that disagree on policies. With her new tribal allies, she has gained access to a backchannel to their inner circles and can take an advantage of these disagreements by false letters and targeted rumours to break the faction's unity."

ZUG_mukisa_radio_broadcasts:0 "Speak to Ugabi"
ZUG_mukisa_radio_broadcasts_desc:0 "It is clear Ugabians wish to hear more wisdom from their sovereign and Mukisa is only happy to bridge the gap with help of modern innovations. Royal entourages equipped with radio transmitters will spread Mukisa's speeches even to the farthest villages in the countryside."

ZUG_mukisa_heralds:0 "Send Out the Heralds"
ZUG_mukisa_heralds_desc:0 "The Blessed Heralds are an age-old tradition by which the Nnabakyala have spread news to the entire nation. By using these heralds, Mukisa can sway many traditionalist commoners to her side."

### Starting ideas

ZUG_territorial_army:0 "Ugabi Central Territorial Army"
ZUG_territorial_army_desc:0 "The UCTA was created in 990 to liberate Ugabi from Mazwi vassalage by Nnabakyala Mukisa. Zebras were sent to Saddle Arabian military academies while foreign arms were purchased for the modern regiments. Yet, it was all for naught as the Storm King razed Mazwi, shattering the large realm and freeing Ugabi. This left the new army without a purpose yet a powerful position in the free nation, enough to rival the monarchy itself. Over the years, UCTA has only grown in influence, directly taking control of economy in key areas and only paying lipservice to the ruler."

ZUG_gulu_tablet:0 "The Gulu Tablet Convention"
ZUG_gulu_tablet_desc:0 "In 1001, Nnabakyala Mukisa signed the Gulu Tablet that ended slavery in Ugabi lands to secure support of an abolitionist coalition to counter the army's growing influence. Over the years, however, the original abolitionist coalition has grown into a broad alliance for further reforms. More alarmingly, many of its leaders are also chieftains of influential eastern tribes and this has given the movement legitimacy even amongst the traditional elite."
