ZUG_modern_innovations_desc:0 "Motorized vehicles are nothing new to the Ugabi population.

ZUG_commemorate_liberation:0 "Commemorate Liberation "
ZUG_commemorate_liberation_desc:0 "Ugabi is a free realm and answers to no foreign overlord. But this freedom was not truly achieved by our own strenght; the original invasion by the Storm King's saw light casualties but also loss of the Golden Horn whereas the later 'liberation' spearheaded by the UCTA simply removed the few yeti garrisons and secured our borders. Truth, however, matters little to her subjects and a beautiful lie serves a better purpose for Mukisa."

ZUG_plan_tour:0 "Announce the Royal Tour"
ZUG_plan_tour_desc:0 "Amidst the great stir over the upcoming Summer Summit, Mukisa has also declared her intention to tour the land and visit the local chieftains.

ZUG_expand_traditional_rights:0 "Expand Traditional Clan Rights and Lands"
ZUG_expand_traditional_rights_desc:0 "As a show of well-being and benelovence Mukisa will expand the traditional rights given to the named clans of Ugabi and gift royal lands to them. In truth, however, most of the rights will be rather superficial, dealing only in specific local matters, and the lands are mostly backwater territories currently unused."

### Power struggle events

zugstart.1.t:0 "Her Vision"
zugstart.1.d:0 "Event where Mukisa is led to the ceremonial platform by the royal entourage whilst the crowds cheer. There she holds a speech declaring the festivals to be done and, as per tradition, what her vision (essentially what the visiting spirit of the previous Nnabakyala showed her). In it she saw Ugabi be ravaged by storms and earthquakes, only to give away to a city of gold. She explains that this must mean that Ugabi will face difficult times in the following year but that, in the end, all will be better. After this she plays her role as Nnabakyala and blows the ceremonial horn (replacement one, as the original was taken by the Storm King) which is followed by a spectacular fireworks show, awing the crowds."
zugstart.1.a:0 "Three cheers to our Nnabakyala!"

zugstart.2.t:0 "Tumultuous Spring"
zugstart.2.d:0 "Follow-up event where Mukisa is in her private parlour, reading reports about the military expanding bandit hnting activities to yet another village (read as them just beginning to extort it) and a certain high ranking Gulu clique reformer has escaped house captivity. Mukisa essentially explains to herself and the player the tumultuous political situation Ugabi is in and how either the military or the Gulu clique can move her aside if they gain the power and popularity. To counter this, she has a plan. She will summon the Clans to a summit in the early summer where she will call upon them to reneve their oaths to her and therefore enforce her authority publicly to the nation. However, she will need to cement her position over the spring and make sure neither faction will be powerful enough to oppose her. If Mukisa plays her cards right, then she will be truly in charge of Ugabi."
zugstart.2.a:0 "§RLet the game begin.§!"

### Starting ideas

ZUG_territorial_army:0 "Ugabi Central Territorial Army"
ZUG_territorial_army_desc:0 "The UCTA was created in 990 to liberate Ugabi from Mazwi vassalage by Nnabakyala Mukisa. Zebras were sent to Saddle Arabian military academies while foreign arms were purchased for the modern regiments. Yet, it was all for naught as the Storm King razed Mazwi, shattering the large realm and freeing Ugabi. This left the new army without a purpose yet a powerful position in the free nation, enough to rival the monarchy itself. Over the years, UCTA has only grown in influence, directly taking control of economy in key areas and only paying lipservice to the ruler."

ZUG_gulu_tablet:0 "The Gulu Tablet Convention"
ZUG_gulu_tablet_desc:0 "In 1001, Nnabakyala Mukisa signed the Gulu Tablet that ended slavery in Ugabi lands to secure support of an abolitionist coalition to counter the army's growing influence. Over the years, however, the original abolitionist coalition has grown into a broad alliance for further reforms."

ZUG_golden_fields:0 "Golden Fields"
ZUG_golden_fields_desc:0 "The wealth of Ugabi lay in its fertile fields. For centuries food and various cash crops have been the base of Ugabian economy, and continues to be to this day."
