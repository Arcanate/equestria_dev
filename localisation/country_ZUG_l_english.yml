### Starting tree focuses

ZUG_earth_celebration:0 "End the Celebration"
ZUG_earth_celebration_desc:0 "The year's celebration festival is drawing to a close. The ancestral spirits have been appeased and Gaia's birthday honoured, it is time for Ugabi to reenter its usual routine. Across the nation, Nnabakyala Mukia's subjects crowds the villages with baited breath for her heralds, while the capital awaits her arrival with baited breath."

ZUG_address_fears:0 "Fear of New"
ZUG_address_fears_desc:0 "It's a hard truth to swallow, but it's undeniable that Ugabi has, and remains far behind its northern and western neighbours, largely due to the population's aversion to change. Even small innovations, brought to Ugabi have raised fears from the citizenry, with Mukisa finding herself hardpressed to address their concerns."

ZUG_modern_innovations:0 "The Wonder Tools"
ZUG_modern_innovations_desc:0 "Internal combustion, motorized vehicles and the like are nothing new to the Ugabi population. However, recent developments have turned what was once used only martially, into a critical asset for the civilians, in the form of a tractor in the fields. Spurred by the success of this new tool, Mukisa wishes to acquire more, gifting them to her people at her wallets expense."

ZUG_western_railroad:0 "The Western Railroad"
ZUG_western_railroad-desc:0 "The Kamarela-Ruguzu railroad, a dream project of her late father, is now nothing but rusted iron and broken foundations after being razed during the Storm King's invasion. Mukisa had always wanted to rebuild it, but this cannot be done with the UCTA's control of the western regions. Yet, even if she could do that, what would stop the military from seizing control of it? Though, with the Summit approaching, said railroad could turn out to be a great weapon in her arsenal."

ZUG_eastern_fields:0 "The Eastern Marshes"
ZUG_eastern_fields_desc:0 "Most of the land in Karagaweze is comprised of wet, marshy, useless soil. Plans to drain the marshes and create farms have been planned for decades, yet none have come to fruition, making the population lose faith, driving them to support the Gulu clique. Mukisa declares openly that it is time to finally see the swamps drained."

ZUG_industrious_subjects:0 "Celebrate The Great Patriots"
ZUG_industrious_subjects_desc:0 "While there are many in the world who view Ugabi as a backwater, an undeveloped nation still stuck in the dark ages, there are many who work hard to improve these lands. The forward-thinking, industrious patriots should be remembered, their work celebrated."

ZUG_farmers_to_workers:0 "Protect the Workers"
ZUG_farmers_to_workers_desc:0 "The Gulu clique's promises of workers rights and fair rents, laws that protect zebras from abuse by their landlords have for a long time won them great favour in the eyes of the population. While these demands are fair and just, these so-called reformers only use these as excuses and lies built to destabilize the country. It is time to defang these dissidents by offering our working people the protection they desire."

ZUG_enflame_western_unrest:0 "Spread Whispers in the West"
ZUG_enflame_western_unrest_desc:0 "Under the tyrannical hoof of the UCTA, the western reaches of Ugabi have been ruins, turned to ash and dust. The soldiers there harass villages, commiting horrid crimes against our people, while any act of protest by the citizens is brutally crushed by these bandits. Yet, Mukisa knows her subjects will act if called upon, and the time to rise up draws ever nearer. When her highness gives the order, the UCTA will not know what hit them."

ZUG_discredit_clique:0 "Discredit the Clique"
ZUG_discredit_clique_desc:0 "The clique claims to be acting on behalf of the common zebra, to be goodhearted reformers seeking to save our people from their oppressors. In truth, these are all lies. The Gulu clique is an organization of megalomaniacs who will stop at nothing to get the power they seek, just like the UCTA. Mukisa shall let her subjects know the truth, letting her people decide for themselves the facts."

ZUG_sway_key_reformers:0 "New Friends, New Futures."
ZUG_sway_key_reformers_desc:0 "A letter arrived in the night, the messenger tired, his clothes ragged. He brings a requst for a secret meeting with a group of reformers who wish to treat with her in good faith. An opportunity she gladly accepts."

ZUG_entice_traders:0 "Entice the Traders"
ZUG_entice_traders_desc:0 "The desolation brought by the Storm King has left trade routes broken, caravans scattered. Yet a slow recovery has seen the trade networks re-open, linking Ugabi to the world at large. While it has filled the coffers of Ugabi, it has also introduced dangerous foreign ideas to our people. To counter this, Mukisa shall seek to align the traders to her reign with monopoly rights and lucrative tarrif exemptions."

ZUG_court_parlays:0 "The Court of Nnabakyala"
ZUG_court_parlays_desc:0 "As part of her daily duties, Mukisa holds court in her royal palace. One part of this a public forum where any subject can appeal to her for justice or seek wisdom. Behind the throne, however, ears are kept open for any ill rumours while lavish meetings are held for the influential to keep them loyal to the throne."

ZUG_hear_merchants:0 "Hear the Merchants"
ZUG_hear_merchants_desc:0 "A group of merchants has recently appealed to the throne for an amend to an edict concerning foreign trade. Mukisa shall listen to what they'll have to say and pass her judgement."

ZUG_modern_friends:0 "To A New Friendship!"
ZUG_modern_friends_desc:0 "Even if part of the traditional elite, Mukisa can feel where the wind is blowing; the ascendance of merchants who are learned in modern arts has created a new powerbase without ancient lineages. An asset that would be most useful in the future."

ZUG_listen_nobles:0 "Host the Nobles"
ZUG_listen_nobles_desc:0 "Part of Mukisa's duties is to host lavish parties for the nobles to showcase her wealth and power. One such party has been planned, and Mukisa intends for this one to be especially grand."

ZUG_traditional_allies:0 "To A Continued Alliance!"
ZUG_traditional_allies_desc:0 "As the old proverb goes, one should not play with fire. The ancient clans and capital nobility are an established powerbase and it would be foolish to risk their ire. Instead, Mukisa will ensure their loyalty and friendship to secure her plans."

ZUG_royal_authority:0 "Power of the Throne"
ZUG_royal_authority_desc:0 "Ugabi might be an union of many clans but there is only one Nnabakyala — and her name is Mukisa."

ZUG_charitable_leader:0 "One Who Cares for All"
ZUG_charitable_leader_desc:0 "The Nnabakyala have always cared for their subjects but has there ever been such a charitable leader lie Mukisa? Her wealth has seen the poor fed, roads constructed and the fields expand across the land. Her wealth is Ugabi's wealth, one and the same."

ZUG_liberation_icon:0 "One Who Led the Liberation"
ZUG_liberation_icon_desc:0 "Ugabi would never have been freed without the work of the venerated Mukisa. It was she who created the armed forces who pushed the invaders out. It was she who freed the slaves from their chains. Without her, there would be no Ugbai today and she will let her subjects know this."

ZUG_ancestral_guidance:0 "One With the Ancestors"
ZUG_ancestral_guidance_desc:0 "As it was and shall be, the Nnabakyala acts as the link between the living and the dead. Her person unites the present, past and the future into one being. Who would dare to question such a vessel of wisdom?"

ZUG_repay_loyalty:0 "Riches to the Loyal"
ZUG_repay_loyalty_desc:0 "TODO"

ZUG_royal_estates:0 "Loyal Subjects"
ZUG_royal_estates_desc:0 "Much land across Ugabi belongs to the throne and most are occupied by local farming communities. It is in these hovels and fields where the most loyal Ugabians dwell yet they are also the most forgotten. Now Mukisa will honour them, at last, for their generations of devoted duty and servitude."

ZUG_visible_monarchy:0 "Modern Approach"
ZUG_visible_monarchy_desc:0 "Mukisa has seen fit to become more approachable to her subjects all across Ugabi. While for years she has held festivals in the capital that have been commemorated by heralds in her name, she now wishes to speak to the directly with the help of modern technology."

ZUG_popular_sovereign:0 "Popular Sovereignty"
ZUG_popular_sovereign_desc:0 "No ruler cannot rule if their subjects oppose them. Mukisa has come to realize the power she can gain by garnering the support of her subjects directly instead of through the traditional chieftains. While they may retain their positions, the throne will become closer to its subjects and earn their unquestioning devotion."

ZUG_damned_traitors:0 "Damnation to the Traitor"
ZUG_damned_traitors_desc:0 "TODO"

ZUG_divine_agents:0 "Loyal Priesthood"
ZUG_divine_agents_desc:0 "Of all the factions in Ugabi, the priests of the Sky and various other religious officials remain staunchly loyal to Mukisa and the institution she stands for. Some have already taken the initiative to wield their influence over the masses by preaching loyalty to their Nnabakyala and how one must be ready to even cast aside their chieftains if they are to oppose her rule. Such forward thinking must be repaid."

ZUG_watchful_spirits:0 "Watchful Spirits"
ZUG_watchful_spirits_desc:0 "Us mortals cannot escape attention of our forebears even after their depature. They watch and protect us. Yet they also punish the wicked and cruel. To betray the Nnabakyala is a crime against the Sky himself and the traitor's soul is cast aside by the winds upon death, never to exist again. Who would risk such damnation?"

ZUG_blessed_dynasty:0 "Blessed By the God"
ZUG_blessed_dynasty_desc:0 "It is clear that the Sky favours Nnabakyala Mukisa. Her dynasty has ruled Ugabi since time immemorial, surviving while other rulers and clans have been vanquished. Now, she stands above all as a divinely ordained ruler, one who speaks with voice of countless ancestors and is connected to the God himself. To serve her is a privilege and every devout subject stands ready to fulfill her commands."

ZUG_absolutism:0 "My Name is Mukisa"
ZUG_absolutism_desc:0 "Ugabi is nothing without its ruler, and that ruler is Mukisa. Anyone who dares to oppose her rule is nothing but a filthy traitor who should be opposed at all costs. Her subjects are devoted to her and know that under her rule they will see Ugabi rise in glory over the others."

ZUG_plan_tour:0 "Announce the Royal Tour"
ZUG_plan_tour_desc:0 "Amidst the great stir over the upcoming Summer Summit, Mukisa has also declared her intention to tour the land and visit the local chieftains. This way will she not only bring the throne closer to the common zebra but also allow her to convince the chieftains to support her in the future."

ZUG_give_gifts:0 "Give Generous Gifts"
ZUG_give_gifts_desc:0 "As a good liege Mukisa will be sure to give approtiative gifts in return for the hospitaly offered by the clan chieftains."

ZUG_see_warbands:0 "Hear the Warriors' Deeds"
ZUG_see_warbands_desc:0 "As the royal tour continues, Mukisa sees fit to trial the clan warriors. Testing them for their fitness and strength, they shall all meet at the capital to show their power lest they wish to dishonor their families and be forgotten."

ZUG_invite_into_royal_guard:0 "Recruit the Bravest and Strongest"
ZUG_invite_into_royal_guard_desc:0 "The royal Horn Guardians are the traditional household soldiers of the Nnabakyala, meant to protect both the royal family and the Golden Horn. But after Storm King's invasion the guard were left in disgrace due to loss of the ancient artifact. But with some incentives and flattery, Mukisa will see more recruits join its ranks."

ZUG_expand_traditional_rights:0 "Expand Traditional Clan Rights and Lands"
ZUG_expand_traditional_rights_desc:0 "As a show of good faith and benevolence, Mukisa shall expand the traditional rights given to the clans and dole out royal land grants to them. This will be combined with special clan assignments as well. Though, beyond the veil however, most of these rewards will be rather superficial, dealing only in specific local matters, and the lands are mostly backwater territories currently unused."

ZUG_commemorate_liberation:0 "Commemorate Liberation "
ZUG_commemorate_liberation_desc:0 "Ugabi is a free realm and answers to no foreigners will. But, this freedom if we are honest was not won in glory: the original invasion by the Storm King shed the blood of the Mazwi while leaving us safe, so when the Storm King continued his war it was easy to defeat the scant garrisons of the Mazwi. This truth, however, would do little good for the people and a beautiful lie serves a better purpose, does it not?"


ZUG_sudden_visit:0 "At the Barracks"
ZUG_sudden_visit_desc:0 "The Ugabi Central Territorial Army might be united by their belief of superioirity they are, in reality, fractured into multiple power groups, each ruled by a powerful officer. While some are large, others are small. One of these smaller forces, however, happens to be located quite close to the capital and Mukisa has seen fit to pay them a visit."

ZUG_secure_arms:0 "Tactics and Gunpowder"
ZUG_secure_arms_desc:0 "Courage and will alone will not win battles. Modern warfare has no room for the old ways. Something that the accursed UCTA has proven time and again. But a question remains; why let them have the monopoly to this power?"

ZUG_eastern_spies:0 "Pay Attention to the East"
ZUG_eastern_spies_desc:0 "It is important to not ignore the Gulu Clique's military assets either. Rumours speak of hidden arms caches in the swamps that are ready to be wielded by an army of revolutionaries blinded by their own self-righteousness. Even if the truth may be stretched, it would be foolish to not heed them."

ZUG_host_military_officers:0 "Host the Honourable Officers"
ZUG_host_military_officers_desc:0 "A recent announcement has raised quite a few eyebrows across Ugabi. Mukisa has seen fit to hold a banquet at the capital dedicated entirely to honouring the achievements of the UCTA. On the guest list are officers from the military and amongst them is a particular marshall Mukisa is keen to have a talk with."

### Power struggle events

zugstart.1.t:0 "Her Vision"
zugstart.1.d:0 "As Mukisa was brought to the ceremonial platform in the traditional palanquin, she displayed the cool demeanour a Nnabakyala ought to in public as the chief messenger of their God. Yet she couldn’t help but be worried. It was the first grand winter festival since the danger of the Storm King’s armies waned. If she failed in rousing the people, who knew what would become of Ugabi with so many clouds gathering. She knew it was all up to her, God’s tool among mortals, a thought she repeated as she took her seat on the platform. Then, silence was called by the court griot. The moment of truth.\n\n“Our most beloved people, o faithful ones of Ugabi. As this festival’s end nears, our God smiles upon all of you and in his infinite love and wisdom, he granted our royal person a vision of things to come.\n\nWe have seen a Storm blowing over our lands, bringing misery and snuffing out ill-tended to hearths and torches alike. We have seen the earth tremble and roar, bringing down the towers of vanity of foolhardy upstarts and greedy chieftains. But for all the cries of the storm and the roars of the earth, we foresaw a city of gold emerging unbroken and defiant, glistening under the clear sky.\n\nThat city, o our people, was Ugabi. Our God warned us of difficult times ahead and as his messenger, we warn you in turn with this promise. A time of gold and milk and honey awaits us. In faith, we will prevail!”\n\nAs the people - seemingly without worry about her vision - applauded her, Mukisa left the podium and made her way to the other podium where the ceremonial golden horn had been placed. There, she would fulfill her role as Nnabakyala and blow it as a warning to the cold wraiths who would dare threaten Ugabi. As she picked up, she couldn’t help but marvel at the details of the forgery her advisor Chausiku had ordered made since the Storm King stole the real one. That devious mare might as well be magical herself with all her tricks. If she was concerned about the need for the real one, she didn’t let anyzebra there notice and blew it. As the fake horn loudly blew, with only the most acute ears being able to remember the difference in sound, the people erupted in cheers as a firework displayed fired in the background."
zugstart.1.a:0 "Three cheers to our Nnabakyala!"

zugstart.2.t:0 "Tumultuous Spring"
zugstart.2.d:0 "Follow-up event where Mukisa is in her private parlour, reading reports about the military expanding bandit hnting activities to yet another village (read as them just beginning to extort it) and a certain high ranking Gulu clique reformer has escaped house captivity. Mukisa essentially explains to herself and the player the tumultuous political situation Ugabi is in and how either the military or the Gulu clique can move her aside if they gain the power and popularity. To counter this, she has a plan. She will summon the Clans to a summit in the early summer where she will call upon them to reneve their oaths to her and therefore enforce her authority publicly to the nation. However, she will need to cement her position over the spring and make sure neither faction will be powerful enough to oppose her. If Mukisa plays her cards right, then she will be truly in charge of Ugabi."
zugstart.2.a:0 "Let the game begin."

zugstart.3.t:0 "Unfounded Fears"
zugstart.3.d:0 "In the event Mukisa is walking outside the capital on one of her fields where a Maregyptian tractor is being shown to her by a pony engineer. Her royal entourage whisper in the back while further away commoners watch the happening. In her mind Mukisa wonders why there is such a fuzz over such a simple machine but she knows the commoner fears the machines due to the military using them for war. She asks the engineer if anyone can drive such a machine. Given a yes, she tells a guard to fetch the oldest commoner in the crowd. That commoner is then ordered by Mukisa to climb onto the tractor alongside the pony engineer. After a while, the vehicle comes active and begins to drive, operated by the old zebra. This should break fear amongst the common masses, who now look in amazement, especially as the tractor breaks the soil so easily."
zugstart.3.a:0 "A tool is a tool, and nothing more."

zugstart.4.t:0 "An Unusual Strike"
zugstart.4.d:0 "When Mukisa arrived at the meeting, she quickly noticed the tense atmosphere. Jengo was nervously fiddling with his papers while Munganajua seemed to incarnate the perfect stiff Ugabian court stiff upper lip but he couldn’t hide the slight twitching in his back leg. As for Chausiku, well, the mare seemed unphased but then again, when was she not? All rose for her and only after she blessed the meeting would they sit down. She then gave voice to Jengo.\n\n“I’m afraid I come as the bearer of bad news. Incomprehensible ones too. Work on the western railroad grinded to a halt. The workers have gone on strike, claiming bad work conditions. They demand a paid compensation. I’ve tried to bargain with them as I had planned for better accommodation to be shipped on site anyway but they wouldn’t have any of it. They demand pay and won’t hear reason. I fear they will escalate and even resort to sabotage. It’s incomprehensible.”\n\nMukisa shurgged: “We do not allow strikes or sabotage. Send in the UCTA. If there’s one thing they’re still good for, it’s beating up uppity but defenseless civilians.”\n\nChausiku intervened: “Would be unwise, your Majesty. It’s not a strike. The UCTA is pressuring the workers so they can get a cut of the money. Well, more like the workers will get a small cut of the UCTA bribe. If we send them in, they’ll break more than the strikers as payback and blame it on them.”\n\n“How would you know about that”, inquired Munganajua, glaring at the mare.\n\n“Because I taught that trick. We used it on the Malwians during the armament years. Very effective”, answered Chausiku\n\nJengo angrily snapped back: “You sound mightily proud of having sabotaged our infrastructure effort.”\n\nChausiku shrugged quietly: “A blacksmith doesn’t stop being proud of his work because a thief stabbed him with one of his swords. Or only very briefly.”\n\n“Even if it is so, we mustn’t pay anything. It would be a public humiliation for her Majesty and her government to even acknowledge such lowly demands. They’ll get back to work soon enough or starve”, concluded Munganajua.\n\nJengo immediately countered that doing so would drastically hurt the project. Adding her support, Chaukisu also pointed out that the cost of just the delay would be worse for the royal coffers than paying. This only caused Munganajua to accuse them of putting money before principles.\n\nFrom then on, the discussion devolved into an argument between the advisors. Finally, Mukisa raised her hoof and all quieted down. The Nnabakyala would decide."
zugstart.4.a:0 "§RJust give them the damned gift to make them go.§!"
zugstart.4.b:0 "YRPWe must bide our time for now.§!"

zugstart.5.t:0 "Report Review"
zugstart.5.d:0 "A backfire event where the comission sent to review and plan the drainign process. It has, however, become obvious that there's been serious misscalculations done; it is simply impossible to fulfill the lofty goals with the current budget. This leaves Mukisa with two options; either she downscales her plans but raise ire of the locals, certainly making some go back to the Gulu faction, or increase the comission's budget from her own wealth."
zugstart.5.a:0 "§OPerhaps some plans can be backscaled?§!"
zugstart.5.b:0 "YRDip into the royal treasury to fulfil the plans.§!"

zugstart.6.t:0 "An Evening Story"
zugstart.6.d:0 "In the event a griot finishes telling a tale in a Western Ugabian village. Afterwards, she continues on to tell about Mukisa, her wealth and fierce prowess. How her rule is wise and just. Essentially tells propaganda of her reign, and how the locals should never forget how their Nnabakyala is still their rightful overlord. Should cause some to leave, out of fear for reprisals from the military while others, silently, avert her gaze. She should make a mental note at the end how she needs to leave when everyone's asleep, or risk meeting end of a barrel the coming morning."
zugstart.6.a:0 "Thankless work, even if for a good pay."

zugstart.7.t:0 "Claims Gone Too Far"
zugstart.7.d:0 "A backfire event where the rumours meant to discredit and ruin image of the Gulu reformers has spilled over to Mukisa's own faction; an influential court noble is accused of being a foul cultist due to a past association to a Gulu reformer accused of being one too. By law this should lead to a trial by the temple, so that the accused is either punished or proven innocent. Problem is that Mukisa knows this noble's daughter is also a member in the military and her spies say he plans to escape to the military's camp if a trial is arranged. But if she does not follow up on charge, she will be seen as weak and unjust, favouring her courtiers over the laws."
zugstart.7.a:0 "§YSay nothing on the matter.§!"
zugstart.7.b:0 "§gArrange for a trial.§!"

zugstart.8.t:0 "Clandestine Meeting"
zugstart.8.d:0 "In the event Mukisa has a meeting with two important Gulu reformers who have come to parlay with her. In return for implementing certain reforms and decrees in the future, she will have their support. Mukisa should bark back, calling some of them such as an elected assembly an affront to her God's blessed rule. She counters by admitting that she sees wisdom in some of their wishes, even going as far as calling them true Ugabians for daring to oppose her to see Ugabi rise. But she calls them fools for forgetting to whom the right to rule belongs and how their ideas of collective rule will simply give rise to anarchy. She tells them that she will agree to heed their advice in the future and raise them to be her councillors. The two ultimately agree to her, severly culling Gulu Clique's leadership."
zugstart.8.a:0 "A fruitful discussion."

zugstart.9.t:0 "Love and Lust"
zugstart.9.d:0 "An event where Mukisa's day in the court is overwhelmed by a fierce debate over an incident that had occured in the capital. Two zebras ended up in a drunken argument over some shared love interest, over which they ended up having a fight over that spilled over into a massive group-on-group riot. Issue for Mukisa is, however, that both defendants come from her rivalling factions and while supporting one will lower influence of the loosing faction it will also increase influence of the winner's side. But as the room comes to a silence, Mukisa must make a choice."
zugstart.9.a:0 "§OThe officer caused this entire situation.§!"
zugstart.9.b:0 "§gChieftain's daughter was in the wrong.§!"

zugstart.10.t:0 "Gift Baskets"
zugstart.10.d:0 "An event where a remote village in the backskirts is awoken to a visit by Nnabakyala's dignitaries. They announce that Mukisa is very pleased with the village's dedication to duty and loyalty, citing their bountiful harvests, on-time taxes and merit gained by some zebras originally from the village. The officials then begin to hand out baskets full of food, cloth linen, money, tools and other needed commodities."
zugstart.10.a:0 "Loyalty to one's better will bring due rewards."

zugstart.11.t:0 "Reforged Spirits"
zugstart.11.d:0 "An event where a border village close to UCTA's lands is being harassed and extorted by a platoon of soldiers. This time, however, the villagers are less subdued. Not so meek. This makes the leading officer curious, who happens to spot one elderly granny just chuckling and demands to know what is funny. The old mare replies and says that times are changing. That once again, Ugabi will be ruled by old laws and God's blessing. How the land will thrive after a cleansing fire. This irks the officer, who spats backs and calls her a deranged hag. A villager takes a step forward, only to be violently shoved back with a rifle. The old mare, irregardless, keeps on laughing and even as the soldiers depart on top their car, the laughter seems to trail after them."
zugstart.11.a:0 "What a loony granny."

zugstart.12.t:0 "Divine Right"
zugstart.12.d:0 "An event where a remote village in the backskirts all the villagers have gathered to see and listen to a travelling priest bearing standard of the Nnabakyala. She tells them how the ancestral spirits are restless and angry. For they see Ugabi suffering from disloyalty and greed. Where zebras no longer heed call of the God and the sovereign God has put to rule over the land. These spirits will not rest, until Ugabi will once again stand behind God's chosen, the one who speaks with the spirits. All good subjects must heed this call, for only damnation and ruination will await those who oppose."
zugstart.12.a:0 "So wills God!"

zugstart.13.t:0 "Dreadful Drill"
zugstart.13.d:0 "An event telling about some new recruit's morning training in the UCTA at some fort in western Ugabi. Mood and sprits are particularly low, as despite a limited lockdown by the officers they have all heard the same; Curse Tablets bearing marks cursing all the traitors and enemies of Ugabi. The recruit in question recalls the horror she'd seen in her village, how her former neighbours and even own family acted like she was some accursed being. Their looks haunt her sleep and make her doubt. But a swift lash strike from an officer brings her out from daydreaming and focus back on the drills."
zugstart.13.a:0 "I need a drink."

zugstart.14.t:0 "Royal Splendour"
zugstart.14.d:0 "An event about a royal parade being organised in the capital to the awe of the people. At first not all too out of the ordinary but Mukisa's appearance shatters this; unlike her normal appearance, she is now clad in ceremonial armor, with her face painted in blue like the Ugabian rulers don in their ascension ceremony. She also wield the Pearl Sword, an ancient sword that was gifted to the hero Ekitala by God to beat back the cold demons and united the Ugabian tribes. Mukisa is descendant of this hero."
zugstart.14.a:0 "All hail!"

zugstart.15.t:0 "Seat of Honour"
zugstart.15.d:0 "An event about an evening dinner party in the countryside after the royal tour draws to its conclusion. However, a rather peculiar scene has developed towards the evening between some military officials and elite associated with the Gulu Clique. They are fighting over the honour of sitting besides Mukisa. Whilst Mukisa knows the tour has been a success and will see her position elevate, having either party gain a place of honour in this dinner party will leech some of that success, elevating their side's popularity. But she will have to choose her poison with a smile."
zugstart.15.a:0 "§gHonourable officer.§!"
zugstart.15.b:0 "§OMost gracious chieftain.§!"

zugstart.16.t:0 "The War Cry"
zugstart.16.d:0 "An event where Mukisa, in a place of honour, receives various Ugabian warbands at a field just outside the capital. The warriors recant to her their deeds and brave acts whilst others fight mock battles against one another to gain the honour to approach Mukisa. The royal court gawk and praise Mukisa's name, as she rewards the greatest warriors with gold and silver. However, Mukisa is far more interested in seeing cracks in the smiles of some Gulu allied chieftains, as their warriors in particular are picked out by Mukisa fo gifts and rewards, in a way swaying their loyalty away from their chieftains and to the royal sovereign instead."
zugstart.16.a:0 "True warrior is not only brave but loyal too."

zugstart.17.t:0 "Sullen Oath"
zugstart.17.d:0 "An event where a serious incident threatens the court. For onw of the recent recruits to the new royal guard is, in reality, a deserter from the UCTA and the regiment he is from has issued a formal request to have them be handed over. By the law, the deserter should be handed over to the regiment but this would showcase power of the UCTA while keeping him would break the law and therefore sullen Mukisa's image."
zugstart.17.a:0 "§gLaw is law, give them the deserter.§!"
zugstart.17.b:0 "§YNo.§!"

zugstart.18.t:0 "Serious Charge"
zugstart.18.d:0 "An event where Mukisa find herself sitting upon her seat whilst a delegation of various chieftains are paying their respects to her. But in middle of it all, a group of officers interrupt the affair to level an accusation at one chieftain for crime of betraying Ugabi and harbouring bandits. The chieftain rejects these claims as lies and fabrications. Irregardless of the truth, Mukisa finds herself with two choices; either accept the charge levelled and apprehend the chieftain, which would break Gulu unity but elevate UCTA's position, or reject the charges, showcasing her own authority but also publicly defending a Gulu supporter."
zugstart.18.a:0 "§gApprehend the accused for proper investigation.§!"
zugstart.18.b:0 "§OThis is just hearsay, nothing more.§!"

zugstart.19.t:0 "Claims Gone Too Far"
zugstart.19.d:0 "A backfire event where Mukisa stands in the rain, inspecting the lined soldiers of the UCTA at some barracks whilst an officer stands in a solemn salute. It doesn't escape Mukisa that the officer harbors no love for her, as she is a known closet-socialist, even as far as rumouredly blaspheming the spirits and God. Issue is that now, after a ceremony where many officers were commemorated and gifted with enough gold to be sure of a shifted loyalty, only this one officer remains. But as Mukisa is about to gift this socialist officer, she surprised Mukisa by bowing and requesting a God's blessing instead. This presents an issue to Mukisa however; as a warrior the officer is perfectly in her right to request it however the blessing would mark the warrior as spiritually healthy, something she is not and it is an open-secret. It'd make a fool of Mukisa. But if she were to refuse the offer that would be seen as a slight, playing into the belief within UCTA that Mukisa does not care for them at all and is only interested at the old ways."

zugstart.19.b:0 "§gThe spirits shall watch over you.§!"

zugstart.20.t:0 "Gathering the Clues"
zugstart.20.d:0 "An event about an interrigation of a Gulu agent by two royal agents of Mukisa in some hut in eastern Ugabi. The agents want to know more about the arms stashed in the swamps, who smuggled them in and who are his partners. The agent interrogated should refuse and the royal agents are left with no choice but to start emplying harder methods. Likely better these methods are simply implied until the agent begins to crack up."
zugstart.20.a:0 "Dirty but necessary work."

zugstart.21.t:0 "Secret Terror"
zugstart.21.d:0 "Special event if both events 6 and 20 are triggered. Following the recent undercover actions, rumours have grown abound about the royal agents sowing unrest and hunting down traitors of the throne. While these have all been a success so far, there has also been some unrest stirred about this, with some whispers calling Mukisa a tyrant. Mukisa can either continue the operations or dial them back to showcase her magnamous nature."
zugstart.21.a:0 "Disregard the unrest and continue the operations."
zugstart.21.b:0 "There will be mercy — for now."

zugstart.22.t:0 "At the Party"
zugstart.22.d:0 "In the event Mukisa is hosting a grand party for a host of UCTA officer, in particular to those from the faction led by Ekiso. He has the seat of honour, alongside some royal court higher-ups and his closest aides. But the two have some privacy, and they chat about past. How they had met once, at the ceremony before the to-be officers travelled to Saddle Arabia for training, how they returned only to see the blight of the Storm King but also how the Ugabians held out. In the end, Ekiso breaks the ice; he knows the UCTA is in a bad spot while Mukisa's tuhority is growing. He, therefore, offers to pledge his soldiers and allied regiments to her, under one condition. That being UCTA will be reformed, not disbanded. Mukisa should retort by saying Ekiso's faction does contain anti-royalist officers. To this, he does agree and offers to see them be disposed of. At least the ones not toeing the line. With this, Mukisa accepts and rises up to offer a toast to Ekiso before the crowds, cementing their alliance."
zugstart.22.a:0 "To friendship!"

### Summit Chaos event chain

zugchaos.1.t:0 "The Clans Gather"
zugchaos.1.d:0 "The starting event in the event chain for the political chaos; details how the clan chieftains, apart from some, have gathered at the royal palace for the summit. Meanwhile the otherwise bustling capital city has fallen oddly silent, as houses have been fortified, merchant stalls closed and the common people hide, as if expecting something. Tense rumours about the army mobilizing in the west and unlawful mob gatherings in the east have given a rise for alarm. Mukisa expected this and how only God knows what will happen in the following days."
zugchaos.1.a:0 "Time will show the answer."


### Mukisa victory

ZUG_mukisa_victorious:0 "Victory of Tradition"
ZUG_mukisa_victorious_desc:0 "As the dust settles, it's the Nnabakyala Mukisa who stands victorious. Now Ugabi stands ready to heed her orders and bring glory in her name."

ZUG_strike_deserters:0 "Attack the Deserters"
ZUG_strike_deserters_desc:0 "Many took up arms against Mukisa, the true ruler, and many of these traitors fled when the fortune turned against them. These stagglers must be hunted down and put down like the wild beasts they are."

ZUG_capture_forts:0 "Capture the Forts"
ZUG_capture_forts_desc:0 "Many Gulu regiments owned and ran their operations from modern fortifications build with the wealth the military stole from the local populace. Now with UCTA's power destroyed, these forts can prove useful for Mukisa's soldiers to control the west."

ZUG_seize_loot:0 "Seize Their Loot"
ZUG_seize_loot_deac:0 "The officers of the UCTA were no better than common thieves, using their arms and training to terrorize the local population into submission and servitude. After their downfall, however, Mukisa is in position to reverse this; the westernlands will be freed and their ill-gotten wealth seized by royal authorities."

ZUG_wipe_out_remnants:0 "No Quarter for the Traitors"
ZUG_wipe_out_remnants_desc:0 "While they may wish to hide and pray God for mercy, the former bandit-soldiers of the UCTA shall meet due punishment. All of them will be hunted down by not simply our soldiers but also the local population who are eager to punish their oppressors."

ZUG_only_grunts:0 "Spare the Skilled and Meek"
ZUG_only_grunts_desc:0 "While many soldiers of the UCTA were naught but bandits, in reality many joined through forced enlistment or out of desperation. It'd be waste to punish these, who have only followed orders. They shall be given a choice; to earn their full pardon through service to Ugabi and the Nnabakyala."

ZUG_include_some_officers:0 "Few Honourable Officers"
ZUG_include_some_officers_desc:0 "Crooks they may be but the officers of the UCTA are also highly trained military officers. it'd be a waste to simply remove them all. The few who show most willingness to serve and have committed light crimes will be granted amnesty if they will pledge fielty to Mukisa. This time, for the final time."

ZUG_secure_gulu_arms:0 "Secure Remaining Arms Stashes"
ZUG_secure_gulu_arms_desc:0 "While most arms stashes belonging to Gulu insurgents have been secured many more still remain unaccounted for. Royal agents and soldiers will be sent to search the eastern swamps, putting down any remaining insurgents and putting the weapons into far better use."

ZUG_surrender_or_die:0 "Issue Final Warning"
ZUG_surrender_or_die_desc:0 "Even with the arms secured, some fierce Gulu zealots linger in the eastern marshes. it is also evident they are being helped by the local villages despite routine patrols and punishments. Mukisa's patience has run out; she has penned a decree that calls for any remaining insurgents to put down their arms and surrender or face her wrath."

ZUG_imprison_remnants:0 "Imprison the Remnants"
ZUG_imprison_remnants_desc:0 "While the demonstrations may have been quelled and arms stashes secured, many Gulu Clique supporters and provocateurs are laying low, hoping to hide out the storm. Mukisa has no intention to let this pass. All those who opposed her reign must see just, due punishment before throne and God."

ZUG_chained_reform:0 "Harsh Yet Fair Justice"
ZUG_chained_reform_desc:0 "While it is true all those who have committed crimes against the throne must be punished, in reality it's not so simple. Many who supported Gulu are well-respected chieftains, well-educated experts and experienced merchants. Zebras whom Ugabi needs. Mukisa will punish the most egregious cases but also pardon those whom wish to serve Ugabi under its true ruler."

ZUG_break_clique:0 "Break the Clique"
ZUG_break_clique_desc:0 "The entity known as Gulu Clique exists no more. Its leaders are imprisoned, its fiercest supported lay dead in the fields and those who'd wrongly believed in their cause now once again serve the Nnabakyala, whose name is Mukisa."

ZUG_ugabi_god_nnabakyala:0 "God, Ugabi and Nnabakyala"
ZUG_ugabi_god_nnabakyala_desc:0 "The hardships are now past us. Ugabi Central Territorial Army and the Gulu Clique have been subdued and Mukisa can finally enact her plans to change Ugabi into a true nation loyal to the Nnabakyala of Kamarela."

ZUG_to_modernize_ugabi:0 "March of Time and Progress"
ZUG_to_modernize_ugabi_desc:0 "While Ugabi is and will be land of traditions, march of time is inevitable. New innovations and industrialisation have allowed other realms to prosper. In order for Ugabi to stand glorious, it too must look up to the future."

ZUG_gulu_expertises:0 "Meet the Gulu Experts"
ZUG_gulu_expertises_desc:0 "As per her agreement with the Gulu dissenters, Mukisa now stands ready to listen to what their plans for reforming Gulu's economy are. Though not an expert and bit suspicious, the plan for exhaustive reformation of Ugabi through a central industrialisation program does sound promising in her ears."

ZUG_urban_planning:0 "Investigate and Restructure Cities"
ZUG_urban_planning_desc:0 "Sad reality is that all Ugabian cities were born and have grown naturally over the centuries. This has led to overcrowded and tightly packed cities where filth festers and diseases run rampart. It is not only ineffective for the economy but also barbarous. Time to has come to remedy this."

ZUG_urban_growth:0 "Foster Urban Growth"
ZUG_urban_growth_desc:0 "As Ugabian cities continue to develope and improve, an interesting issue has come up; whereas previously the cities were overcrowded without much work to go around, now there are empty houses and lack of adequate labour force needed for the planned factories. A program will be launched to coerce and re-settle zebras from the distant fields into the cities for good paying work."

ZUG_import_industrial_machines:0 "Contact Patriotic Merchants"
ZUG_import_industrial_machines_desc:0 "By using connections to Ugabian merchants and traders both home and abroad the reformers can ensure that only good industrial machinery will be imported into Ugabi at a good price."

ZUG_royal_corporations:0 "Royal Corporations"
ZUG_royal_corporations_desc:0 "While the reformers profess admiration for private entrepreneurialism and capital economy, Mukisa still holds some doubts. To ensure predominance of the Nnabakyala, certain industrial sectors will be reserved and run under various chartered companies owned by the throne."

ZUG_royal_labour:0 "Labour for the Nnbakyala"
ZUG_royal_labour_desc:0 "Work is simply not done for one's sake. All labour in Ugabi is done in the service of thr throne and the one who sits upon it. Every crop grown, every product produce, it all contributes to a common good and is the highest form of patriotism."

ZUG_fund_private_development:0 "Support and Fund Private Businesses"
ZUG_fund_private_development_desc:0 "While a thriving merchant class has always existed in Ugabi, the modern idea of private businesses that cater to the workers does not. In order to build up an industrial economy, there must also exist a properous middle-class of entrepreneurials so not only the affluent but also workers can spend their money."

ZUG_revise_tax_code:0 "Revise the Tax Code"
ZUG_revise_tax_code_desc:0 "With the growth of industrial labour and urban businesses it is time to revise the ancient tax codes. The old feudal tax conducted by the tribes and conflicting rules in the cities are in dire need of revising and streamlining. A group of modern educated financier will be tasked to sort out this mess."

ZUG_connected_cities:0 "Bloodveins of Industry"
ZUG_connected_cities_desc:0 "Industry requires continued movement of goods and produces. Simple dirt roads and old stone paveways simply won't do. The current railroad must be expanded to cover rest of Ugabi to stimulate further economic growth"

ZUG_new_mines:0 "Feeding the Industries"
ZUG_new_mines_desc:0 "Day by day, as more factories are built and railroads track laid, the need for a supply of iron and coal increases. The old mines from the old imperial times are simply not enough; though small, modern mining equipment and expertise will aid, for now, in keeping up the demand."

Sadly, it was razed and destroyed during Storm King's invasion. It is time to finally revive the railroad and see to its expansion."

ZUG_agricultural_economy:0 "Ugabi's Golden Fields"
ZUG_agricultural_economy_desc:0 "Ugabi's wealth has always grown from its soil. It'd be foolish to disregard the farm fields and estates entirely. New machines and technologies will improve yields, and the wealth gained will enable industrialisation of the land in the cities."

### Mukisa events 

zugmukisa.1.t:0 "Mukisa's Triumph"
zugmukisa.1.d:0 "Event about Mukisa's victory in the aftermath of Gulu protests disbanded and military subdued. Now she steps inside the summti hall, to speak to the clan chieftains gathered there. She makes a grand speech, where she says that the chaos showcases fractures, disloyalty and spiritual imbalance in the realm. The tribes must therefore now once again unite together and pledge their eternal loyalty to the Nnbakalyalas. One by one, all the chieftains rise up and pledge their tribes to her, much to Mukisa's satisfaction."
zugmukisa.1.a:0 "Now the true work can begin."

zugmukisa.2.t:0 "The Hour Strikes"
zugmukisa.2.d:0 "Event set in some marshy location where some Gulu hideout is preparing for an assault by Mukisa's forces. A herald is yelling to them to surrender, to spare their lives. Essentially tells them to go fuck themselves before the attack comes, ending in the death of the Gulu resistance fighter from whose PoV the event is happening."
zugmukisa.2.a:0 "Defiant even in defeat."

zugmukisa.3.t:0 "Unquestionable Sovereign"
zugmukisa.3.d:0 "Event where Mukisa is signing some documents and decrees whilst on the sides the royal court awaits in stand by, ready to act on every whim. At some point she signals for the bureaucrat to accept her signed papers, who does so crawling and bowing, before announcing she will hold the court, rising up. All the court then bows as she leaves for the throne room before trailing after her, trying to get themselves as close to Mukisa as possible. Mukisa should very much find this entire ordeal pleasing in her ears."
zugmukisa.3.a:0 "Only I rule in Ugabi."

zugmukisa.4.t:0 "The Palace Conclave"
zugmukisa.4.d:0 "Event from POV of the priest family's head whose a priest himself. He alongside others have been summoned to the palace by the Nnabakyala for a grand sermon. Nothing unusual, these would have happened before. But as the Nnabakyala enters into the room, dressed in her attire, the air would feel different. As she steps to the central altar, she'd share a vision to them all. How she was on a plain beset by harsh winds and the skies were covered by clouds that blocked the sun, crashing at one another and leaving only small openings. But then the winds ceased, and the clouds began to merge. Until there was but one large, that then parted for the Sun to shine to the land once again. Mukisa then proceeds to tell she sees this as direct message from God for change. To unite the faitful under one temple, to not let them clash against one another. This is why she has had the priests from the individual temples summoned, so they could, at this royal conclave before God's intermediary, seek to forge bonds. The POV should perhaps feel bit query over this but another priest elsewhere in the hall yells out her support, citing loyalty to Nnabakyala. Another one follows suite, citing how God commands this. Soon, even the POV cannot help but to join in pledging their support."
zugmukisa.4.a:0 "It is God's will!"

zugmukisa.5.t:0 "Fidelity and Faith"
zugmukisa.5.d:0 "Event from POV of the farming family, that is arosen to a righteous anger (there should be no doubt for the POV, they should feel absolutely adamant they are doing what is right for God and their sovereign). Turns out, that their local temple has chosen not to abide to the central temple doctrine and therefore has not only betrayed Nnabakyala but God too. The farmers, aided by royal heralds and agents, have put the temple under siege and stand ready to storm it, armed with their farming tools and odd rifle. Inside, the sound of rituals can be heard before the heavy iron gates are torn open with the aid of explosives."
zugmukisa.5.a:0 "For pious Ugabi!"

zugmukisa.6.t:0 "Dutiful Teaching"
zugmukisa.6.d:0 "Event from POV of the farming family's youngest children, who is listening to the new teacher from the capital teaching the letters and words upon a chalkboard outside. In the distance, some of the older zebras too listen in admist their work. The teacher recounts the legend of the Golden Horn, how the legendary hero was gifted it by God and the hero used it to vanquish the cold spirits from the land. He then proceeds to gift them all with a book that has both the story and a section for the alphabets. The kids eagerly open and awe at the colourful pages. The teacher, however, quickly gathers them all back and tells that they must take care of these books, as they are gift from the most gracious Nnabakyala to their loyal subjects. From this he tells them to open the first page, on which is actually a drawn image of Mukisa and some text that the teacher tells them to repeat after him."
zugmukisa.6.a:0 "M for Mukisa, our lawful sovereign and herald of God..."

zugmukisa.7.t:0 "Family Gathering"
zugmukisa.7.d:0 "Event from POV of Mukisa as she sits upon the throne, joined only by her family and children. No one else is present except for few close servants, scribes and royal guards. After a while, Mukisa declares that it is her intention to decree a law of succession. This stuns everyone, but she continues on that succession has far too often led to chaos in Ugabi, as family turns against each other. She reminds them all she herself is growing old, too. For this sake, in model with the monarchies in the world, she will implement primogeniture; eldest child will inherit all. Silence falls, as eyes turn to Amanyi. But soon, cries of outrage emerge as some of his siblings decry how their rights and priviliges are being trampled over. But Mukisa will have none of this, declaring that her decree is final and that she will not tolerate any further outbursts, managing to calm things. Her attention then turns to Amanyi, whom she beckons to come forth. He does and bends before her throne. Mukisa then rises up and declare him her successor as Prince of Ugabi, with the authority bestowed by God. The royal guards raise their weapons and acknowledge this. But rest of the family remain quiet and anger clear upon their faces."
zugmukisa.7.a:0 "The succession is secured."

zugmukisa.8.t:0 "Realm Reneved"
zugmukisa.8.d:0 "Event from POV of Amanyi, now styled as Prince of Ugabi (which should chafe him a bit) is standing at a balcony in the royal palace with his mother, Mukisa, as they greet celebrating commoners on this holiday for Ugabi's recent successes and stability under Mukisa's personal rule. Just behind them, in the shadows, military officers and court nobles stand by like statues, awaiting any possible command. All this personal rule feels like a heavy burden to Amanyi but as far as he can see, her mother seems to actually revel in her authority and power. His thoughts are cut short by a comment from Mukisa about how Ugabi now stands ready. He questions what she means and she in turn points to the far horizons, how Ugabi must now do its part to unite the zebras of the Great Lakes, to bring peace to the remnants of the broken empire. The land needs one ruler to do it. Amanyi says nothing but Mukisa turns around, grabbing him along and marching inside, officers and nobles bowing. Her last remark is how him and her must see the gold- and witchsmiths for a special project."
zugmukisa.8.a:0 "The time has come."

zugmukisa.9.t:0 "The Opening Day"
zugmukisa.9.d:0 "Event from POV of an artisan family in the capital Kamarela preparing for the opening of their new store, stylized to the photos and images from Saddle Arabian and Maregyptian shops. Theirs is not the only store, as today countless other modern stores and shops open across the city, with a holiday so everyone is free to visit the stores. It has been in part funded by a stipend from the government, and just above the new cash register hungs a photograph of Mukisa, surrounded by decorative flowers and an insence lamp slowly burning. Entire family stands ready to work together, and the mother then flips the sign on the front door, and immediatelly the first customer enters in."
zugmukisa.9.a:0 "Welcome, how may we serve you?"

zugmukisa.10.t:0 "Way of the Wrench"
zugmukisa.10.d:0 "Event from POV of the farming family bidding goodbye to their second eldest daughter. She and others from the village are going away to learn about the tractors, so she can return in half year to teach them in turn. Others in the village are also bidding their farewells to their children, before they all embark upon the trucks to travel to Gulu, where the institute is located. The family wonders if she will be alright. Youngest maybe remarks how she'll come back as a fancy zebra. To that they all chuckle."
zugmukisa.10.a:0 "An engineer from our family? That'd be something."

zugmukisa.11.t:0 "What to do with Baminazpus?"
zugmukisa.11.d:0 "Event for player to decide what to do with the warrior queen. Either the player can release her under an oath to never raise arms against the throne or gifting her an estate far away from public sight, under strict supervision of the Golden Griots."
zugmukisa.11.a:0 "Release her for an oath."
zugmukisa.11.b:0 "She is too dangerous to be released..."

zugmukisa.12.t:0 "Performance Practises"
zugmukisa.12.d:0 "Event set in the POV of a Golden Griot agent, preparing his instrument alongside some normal orchestral members set to provide enterntainment across the city. He playes friendly, chatting with the fellow band members but makes attention of their playful comments upon Mukisa, including one member making a snideful remark upon the monarch, since she comes from the north. He is sure to earmark her as a potential trouble maker to be apprehended after the coronation is over."
zugmukisa.12.a:0 "The show must go on."

zugmukisa.13.t:0 "Out In the Rain"
zugmukisa.13.d:0 "Event set in the POV of a young child sitting outside a prison with her grandfather amongst other zebras. The prison, somewhere in northern Great Lakes, housed a lot of army officers that were captured after Ugabi conquest, interred to make sure no rebellion would follow. The child shoudl be able to remember mother very well. At last, the prison gates open and from within the prisoners emerge; slightly haggard and underfed but in good spirits. Many happy reunions follow, until the child's mother too emerges. Maybe end in the two hugging?"
zugmukisa.13.a:0 "A long awaited reunion."

zugmukisa.14.t:0 "Her Illustrious Imperial Majesty"
zugmukisa.14.d:0 "Event about Mukisa standing in her royal quarters, being worked on by a regiment of tailors preparing her coronation outfit. Amanyi is by her side, being himself prepared for his own princely outfit. He should be in a bit dour mood, telling straight at Mukisa she disapproves her title. She should dismiss him, saying her achievement is worthy equal to the old Mansas or even the great Kaisers of Griffonia far away. Only an imperial title is worthy to bear. He should counter, saying that such a title would only cause ire in the nearby realms by claiming such a high title. She should allude that such trivialities ought to not matter, how they should not be foolish enough to raise an ire against the power of Unified Great Lakes. This time he bides his tongue but internally just thinks about the reports from military commanders of fierce resistance and noncooperation from the locals. Not to mention some unrest even back home. Maybe end the scene with Mukisa clapping her hooves, dissmissing the tailors and ordering a dinner to be prepared for them."
zugmukisa.14.a:0 "Worries darken the prince's mind."

zugmukisa.15.t:0 "Her Legacy"
zugmukisa.15.d:0 "Event from POV of Mukisa, whom is feeling very tired. She is going over reports at her desk, alongside the plans for the grand coronation. It is late in the evening, so she quits everything for the day and walks away alone to the royal palace's temple. Her thoughts are muddled, her ears have picked up the murmurs from courtiers about her son and zebras flocking covertly to him. It should worry her, there have been cases of old Nnabakyalas being found dead in their bedchamber due to ambitions of their children. She makes her way to the grand temple and to its altar. There, amongst statues dedicated to her ancestors, stands one of her own father. Before its shadow she lets her thoughts get away; Amanyi would not betray her like that. She knows him to be an ableminded zebra, one that has the willpower to carry on the dynasty in her wake. She turns to pray, and this comforts her heart further."
zugmukisa.15.a:0 "Spirits, messengers of Lord, hear my prayer."

zugmukisa.16.t:0 "On the Patrol"
zugmukisa.16.d:0 "Event from POV of a soldier patrolling in Timbucktu's streets. While life in city has slowly began to revitalize, scars of the unification wars are still present and beggars fill the city streets. On the ruined houses, there read slowgans about coming of the end, pleading begs for God to aid and anti-Ugabian propaganda. The entire platoon is bit nerved, knowing there are still zebras whom resist them. Maybe include a small skirmish in the scene?"
zugmukisa.16.a:0 "Patrolling the North almost makes you wish for a new war."

zugmukisa.17.t:0 "At the Desk"
zugmukisa.17.d:0 "Event from POV of a low-level bureaucrat in some northern city attempting to guide some local resident through paperwork for an identification. Problem is they don't speak the same language, only leading to confusion and frustration until the local just rips the papers before walking away."
zugmukisa.17.a:0 "What a mess."

zugmukisa.18.t:0 "Her New Role"
zugmukisa.18.d:0 "Event from POV of Mukisa's daughter, now the new royal governor of Mazwi. Very bitterminded slob who feels like her future has now been robbed from her due to her idiotic mother and scheming bastard half-brother Amanyi. She arrived to the city and has taken residence in the old residence of Mansas, alongside a cadre of troops and servants from Ugabi. But for most part, due to shortage of skilled servants, the old bureaucrats and royal advisors still linger in the palace to keep the region operating. And now some of those have began to approach her about gatherings and meetings. Plots for an insurgency against Ugabi, which will need an unifying icon to walk behind with."
zugmukisa.18.a:0 "They will pay."

zugmukisa.19.t:0 "God's Blessed Ruler"
zugmukisa.19.d:0 "Event from POV of Mukisa sitting at her throne, trying to focus upon a speech being delivered by a tribal chieftain relaying his and his entire tribe's congratulations upon her upcoming acccension. Entire world seems to heave around her a bit and her headache is killing her. Until she wonders why she is laying down, and that will be her last though; the Nnabakyala Mukisa has collapsed to the shock of the court."
zugmukisa.19.a:0 "Summon a doctor!"

zugmukisa.20.t:0 "Death of Mukisa"
zugmukisa.20.d:0 "General perspective event that tells how Mukisa's death announcement has shocked the realm. But only a day after, things begin to move; in the capital, a murmur begins to ripple amongst the people over the hardships caused by Mukisa's war, and in the distant regions formerly hidden resistances have emerged openly to defy the local garrisons, with many rural areas completely revolting, pushing out royal officials. In few places, the royal governors, siblings of Amanyi, have either escaped overseas with as much as wealth as possible or alligned themselves to the local resistance movements, especially in Mazwi and Timbucktu. In Kamarela, the royal palace is in general chaos, with Amanyi deep in shock,not relaying any orders. The troops prepared for the coronation parade stand guard around the royal palace."
zugmukisa.20.a:0 "Times of turmoil."

zugmukisa.21.t:0 "Glory Incarnate"
zugmukisa.21.d:0 "”Ha! You thought I was dead but it is I, Mukisa! I am now empress and all of the Great Lakes shall be mine! Or will they? I am indeed very much dead. You are now living in a timeline where I died but also didn’t, preventing that weak son of mine from fulfilling his duties as Nnabakyala. Which is awkward to say the least but God works in mysterious ways, does he not? So yes, I, Mukisa is dead but then again, am I? I’ve been told this joke has gone on quite enough and the dev wants to say a few words.”\n\nJust a placeholder event to fool you, the player, to think Mukisa will get coronated. If you got this even in a non-console game, please relay the bug to devs. If you used consoles, then turn back and do this focus properly."
zugmukisa.21.a:0 "Awkward..."

### Amanyi events

zugamanyi.1.t:0 "The Prodigal Son"
zugamanyi.1.d:0 "The liner’s first class mess hall was abuzz with hundreds of wealthy passengers, many of which were trying to catch a glimpse of the Ugabian heir over their morning coffee. Some would have revealed in the attention but Amanyi’s mind was lost in his own thoughts, desperately trying to remember these moments on the campus’s communal breakfasts amidst the soothing noise of the Re’emian cicadas.\n\nHis mother’s message had come not as a letter of a mother to her son but in the form of a posse of noblezebras and servants. They ordered him to go at once, though hidden in the oh so honeyed ways of Ugabian court life. There was no point in arguing really, so he packed up and left. Despite it all, he tried to enjoy this breakfast. Despite its luxury, a passenger liner’s mess hall still had a fleeting aura of normalcy and he wished to make the most of it.\n\nHe got up and went to get a cup of tea at the but seeing he was about to pour, a noblezebra scrambled and hurried to take the cup out of his hooves, pour the tea and put sugar in it before presenting it to Amanyi. He took a sip and tried to smile through the ghastly taste of a Chitali white tea blend ruined by sugar, thanking the noblezebra.\n\nSome time later, they finally arrived at Kamarela, welcomed by the thundering noise of coastal batteries firing. A huge crowd had gathered to welcome him. Cheers and applause from the moment the liner had entered the harbour to the moment Amanyi finally touched ground. He felt a bit unsure of what to do. It was strange how quickly one stopped being used to addressing large crowds. A noblezebra informed him to stay put as a welcome party would come to him and so he did.\n\nThen the crowd cleared and all bowed as Mukisa approached him, flanked by a few griots who were silencing the crowd by properly introducing Mukisa with their singing voices. Then, they stopped, causing the harbour to fall into some form of silence. Finally, his mother spoke.\n\n“My son. Welcome back home.”\n\nAnd proceeded to hug Amanyi. He hugged her back. Right hoove on the left shoulder. Three pecks on the cheeks. Left. Right. Left. No contact. Then eyes closed and a touch of the forehead. Four seconds. Eyes open. End of the touch. Hooves down. Solumn smile. End of embrace.\n\nAh, the cold embrace of a public display of affection carefully in line with protocole rules."
zugamanyi.1.a:0 "Good afternoon, mother."

zugamanyi.2.t:0 "A Prince’s Stroll"
zugamanyi.2.d:0 "It was a beautiful morning as Amanyi wandered about the palace garden, cheerfully humming some tune he couldn’t quite remember the title of. It was a welcome moment of peace, away from his courtly duties and formality. Well, for as long as he could escape his retinue of servants, throne guardians and courtiers trailing him by walking a little bit faster at each turn among the bushes. As they turned around and caught up to him, Amanyi fell silent once more. Surely the heir of Ugabi humming a Re’emian tune would cause a scandal at court and he would rather not deal with the headache that it would entail. Keeping the peace and all that...\n\nYet, he couldn’t get the song out of his head and so, as another turn was near, he began to discreetly trot so he could resume his humming for a bit. No other way to clear the head from an earworm after all. But then, bam. A young foal was walking and Amanyi tripped on him and flew over him. Both ended up on the ground.\n\n“Oh goodness! My apologies!”\n\nAmanyi tried to laugh it off and get back up to help out the poor zebra and dust off. But the only thing he could see was a bunch of aghast faces. The foal had frozen on the ground, the courtiers looked as if there had been a murder and the throne guardians were scrambling. Two ran up to him to “help him”, effectively straightening him up quite roughly while the others tried to apprehend him. He had to scream over the noise of the servants dusting him off to prevent the guards from roughing up the poor foal. The situation calmed down for just a second before one of the gardeners rushed to bow, scraping the floor, to be for mercy, apologizing for his son’s mistakes and promising to punish him. Amanyi could barely get a word in as some of the courtiers were already scolding the gardener in his place as befitting protocole. He eventually just stopped talking, seeing as nozebra really listened to what he was saying and walked away, forcing the courtiers and servants to follow him. He turned his head to make sure that none of his followers stayed behind to make things painful for the gardeners and his son and only hoped that the gardener wouldn’t be too hard on the innocent foal. On the next turn, he only allowed himself to sigh, unsure of who he even was anymore."
zugamanyi.2.a:0 "I should cut back on the humming so this doesn’t happen again."

zugamanyi.3.t:0 "Absolutism"
zugamanyi.3.d:0 "That afternoon, Amanyi had decided to go and read on the balcony overlooking the western gardens. It was a welcome moment of respite but he was quickly distracted from his reading. His mother had decided to hold her court in the gardens below. He noticed that it was a case heard in last recourse in front of the Nnabakyala, one that hadn’t been planned by the law and for which there was no precedent. He had missed the early part but could discern that it was something about land rights. A scholar had come to argue about the case but his mother interrupted his oral argument and declared on the spot that she was ordering a change in the law in favor of the defendant. No argument followed and both parties were dismissed. Just like that, the law had changed.\n\nAnd just like that, the ruling was done and the law had changed. This impressed Amanyi and struck him despite it not being the first time he had seen his mother rule like that. But he hadn’t learnt at the time. He reminisced about his time in Re’em where he learned about the various political systems of the world. How absolute rule like they had in Ugabi was rarely the norm and how laws, institutions and mere citizens could frustrate the ruler’s decision in a peaceful fashion. It had surprised him at first but he had come to practice it. He had grown fond of it. The confrontation of different points of view, the diversity of methods to tackle an issue, the introduction of new information by the more knowledgeable on such or such matter. Oh! The work of synthetism. Such thrills for one’s mind! They could talk all they long and still could improve on the conclusion, if there even was one to find!\n\nThis made him think about absolute rule and how he would be entrusted with its power. He shivered at the thought. Could one rule supreme and alone effectively? Sure, there was the benefit of rapidity and consistency but was that true indeed? Was a lone zebra not a slave to their own emotions, their fears, their ignorance, their obsessions and their blind spots. Does one rule better alone, surrounded by fearful sycophants, than together with mind bogglingly talkative contrarians? Or maybe absolutism was simply a tool, one that required learning, care and experience to be weld properly.\n\nHe looked around him and sighed. There was nozebra to answer but him."
zugamanyi.3.a:0 "Could I be an enlightened despot or would I just fool myself into thinking I am?"

zugamanyi.4.t:0 "Course of Action"
zugamanyi.4.d:0 "An event from the POV of Amanyi in state of distress, anxiety and just ton of stress. He is beign addressed by royal advisors and army officers, each offering him advice on what to do about the current unrest wrecking not just the newly conquered lands but also the capital itself. The army officers are requesting permission to deal with the crisis, so as to save the realm. But the royal advisors fear the army will be too extreme; sure, there will be deaths, but these deaths should be limited to just those whom are behind the chaos.

ZUG_camp_ideology_reform_desc:0 "The decrepit laborers within our camps work for a simple reason. They fail to understand the truths of the world. They suffer and toil in pursuit of these truths, struggling so they can understand that voluntary, patriotic service to the nation is the highest ideal. So that one day they may leave their chains, and work of their own regard."

ZUG_chain_gang:0 "Neverending Chain Gangs"
ZUG_chain_gang_desc:0 "With the successes of our industrial programs, they must be expanded. All citizens will be given a chance to sign up for labor programs, and the poor will come running.

ZUG_minimal_national_welfare_desc:0 "Now that we stand upon our own four hooves, we can afford to institute a new program to keep the citizens happy.

Of course, it shall also come with information about all the other opportunities where a zebra can further prosper within our nation. Just for some encouragement."

ZUG_gulu_scum:0 "The Harmonic Vermins"
ZUG_gulu_scum_desc:0 "Whatever the methods of the Gulu may be, their foundations are anti-Ugabian to the root. They speak of corrupting the land with ideas about politics and other toxic concepts. The people of Ugabi don't need these waragi elitists to tell them what to do. For through the will of God, and his messengers the UCTA, the citizens will be shown the correct path."

ZUG_loyal_to_throne:0 "Loyalty to the Nnabakyala"
ZUG_loyal_to_throne_desc:0 "The UCTA's mandate over Ugabi was taken from the heretics in a flash of fire and a clash of steel. But now it is time to make it official.

ZUG_silent_throne:0 "The Silent Throne"
ZUG_silent_throne_desc:0 "There is a reason Mukisa handed over the reins of state to us.

### Olukalu post-Great Lakes unification


### UCTA events 

zugmilitary.1.t:0 "UCTA"
zugmilitary.1.d:0 "The city is quiet this morning. Some citizens still walk the streets, though many stay in their homes, fearful of the marching outside. But none dared to speak. Not while the jackboots marched, at least.\n\nThey came marching into Kamarela from all sides. Some regiments in columns, marching two by two, some as mobs without order or tact. But they marched all the same. Their boots clacking against the city streets' hard earth, eyeing up citizens, looking for traitors and heretics. Just as the marching began to stop, as the people just got a break from the rhythm of fear, just as the regiments had all filtered into the city and took positions around government buildings and temples, the troops set up loudspeakers. Crackling to life, the entire Capital heard the same message, broadcast loud and clear.\n\n"Attention loyal and devout residents of Kamarela. Be not afraid. At the request of the ill Nnabakyala Mukisa, and in response to threats on her life, the UCTA has arrived to protect her and the nation from the taint that threatens it. Mukisa and her belongings have been liberated from the Capital, and are on their way to a safer location where her ailment can be treated. UCTA regiments will now begin a search of the city for known traitors, and will begin executing God's will. You are all expected to provide full cooperation. Non-compliance will be acknowledged as resistance. Reporting a traitor to your local company will be rewarded."\n\nThe radios cut out for a moment, before sparking back to life with a line reverberating throughout the city; "Glory be to God."\n\nThen the city heard the firing lines begin, and the crack of heels on earth was replaced with the crack of gunshots."
zugmilitary.1.a:0 "The capital and all of Ugabi holds its breath."

zugmilitary.2.t:0 "Utter Chaos"
zugmilitary.2.d:0 "Follow-up event where the capital erupts into a live warzone, with parts of it being taken over and fortified by various military factions. Firefigths have ensued, with tanks and platoons patrolling the streets, shooting at anyone not part their group. More civilians than soldiers already lay dead and rotting in the open, with remaining hiding whilst bullets and explosions ruin the capital."
zugmilitary.2.a:0 "God save us!"

zugmilitary.3.t:0 "The Old and Young"
zugmilitary.3.d:0 "After few days of fighting, an uneasy equilibrium now rules the capital as two large factions now control the city; one led by the old marshall Ekiso and other led by Olukalu. Whilst their beliefs are known to clash, with Ekiso being a more conservative and Olukalu a radicalist, neither side has power to overwhelm the other. So the two agree to meet and negotiate. In the end, they agree that in order to save Ugabi, they will form an alliance and share power as equal Marshals of the UCTA."
zugmilitary.3.a:0 "The Marshals shall lead Ugabi to glory!"

zugmilitary.4.t:0 "To Ease Their Pain"
zugmilitary.4.d:0 "Event from the POV of a priest walking down the factory floor admist smog and fire. They are with guards and assistants. The priest preaches to all about how Ugabi, now truly blessed by God, shall bring forth a new age, where Ugabians, s God's chosen children, shall inherit the Great Lakes from degenerates who have forsaken Him. Now, however, they must all endure grueling work until that time comes for rest."
zugmilitary.4.a:0 "Endure for God and Ugabi!"

zugmilitary.5.t:0 "Left, Right..."
zugmilitary.5.d:0 "Event from the POV of an officer inspecting a worker militia column that is presenting itself. The officer should likely scowl at their rowdy appearance and lack of finesse but still helds a speech, applauding them for volunteering to serve Ugabi and the Marshalls. With their comrades in the UCTA, they shall too march against Ugabi's enemies as one. The worker-soldiers salute and march, with the officer rolling eyes at their messy marching order."
zugmilitary.5.a:0 "We shall bleed for victory."

zugmilitary.6.t:0 "On the Road"
zugmilitary.6.d:0 "Event from POV of a normal Ugabian who was a Gulu supporter, now amongst many whom are marching on the rural plains watched over by guards. Until in the distance a camp emerges and they march through it. There, they are lined up into rows and columns before a crippled UCTA officer. She addresses herself as camp-colonel, whom oversees their rehabilition into loyal Ugabians. As long as they will work, they will be fed, and through rigorous labour, they may see themselves freed."
zugmilitary.6.a:0 "Work will set you free."

zugmilitary.7.t:0 "To Swear An Oath"
zugmilitary.7.d:0 "On any other day, Mukisa thought, the sight in front of her would be an impressive one. Regiments of Ugabi's army stood arrayed in the halls, the seats occupied by its officers and other "royal guests." It was a grand display, but all Mukisa could feel was contempt.\n\nA griot called out, "And so, by the grace of God, the court of the Nnabakyala welcomes Marshal Ekiso and General Olukalu." Mukisa thought to herself, "So the officers were finally here then, only a few minutes late." The two zebras appeared at the chamber entrance, entering through the two massive bronze gates, wearing not traditional Ugabian garb like other members of the court, but their military dress uniforms. But where were those traditional members now, where was the Gulu? Mukisa knew where they were, gone one way or another, and likely never to return to her. Sure, the disloyal dissidents were gone, but so were her close friends and advisors, with those two being responsible. Even Munganajua was gone.\n\nThe two generals proceeded down the carpet-lined floor towards Mukisa, and as they passed, UCTA soldiers stood at attention and saluted, not for their monarch, but for their generals. Arriving at the foot of her throne, the generals kneeled before Mukisa. Never before she had felt so humiliated by a servant's kneeling, and Mukisa's contempt only grew as she began to recite the speech she had been given.\n\n"Faithful subjects of Ugabi, we are gathered for a grand occasion this day. Through their loyal service to the state and efforts to root out God's enemies in our land, the UCTA has proven themselves worthy of guiding Ugabi and its people into the times ahead. Ugabi has a destiny to fulfill, a destiny ordained by God, and there is no one more worthy to guide us there than the two Zebras standing in front of me." Mukisa choked on her words, and had to force herself with all her willpower to continue speaking. "As Nnabakyala, I shall be stepping back from the affairs of state to more effectively serve God and our nation, and in my stead, the officers of the UCTA shall handle these duties. And so, I anoint you, Marshal Ekiso, Guardian of the Realm, and you, General Olukalu, are promoted to Marshal, and shall serve alongside Ekiso as the realm's second Guardian. Do you accept this responsibility in the service of God, nation, and the monarchy of God?"\n\nEkiso and Olukalu both nodded, and Mukisa began again, "Then rise, Guardians of Ugabi and serve your Nnabakala." The two generals picked up their heads, and for the first time, Mukisa could see their faces clearly, Ekiso was nearly beaming, so pleased with himself for gaining power. But Olukalu? She smiled as well, but it was a wicked smile, one Mukisa would do anything to wipe off her face. But now she was powerless, and as the Generals stood, the court clapped, and the soldiers banged their rifle butts on the floor, and over the rhythmic slamming, Mukisa could see the bronze gates closing again, the last door, closed upon her golden cage."

Admist it, the window to his room opens and he in panic lifts his pistol to kill an incoming assasin. But none come and he chides himself for panicking before return gto prayer. But a whisper of wind from the ajar window gets him to get up and close it. As he does so, he looks to the capital city at night. Scars from the battles are still present. Then, he looks up to the skies. Just above lays the grand royal towers that remain empty from their mistress. Then, one by one, starts appear to the night sky. Moon comes out from hiding behind clouds, shining light from just behind the Nnabakyala's tower. Ekiso stands breathless in the sight of this and his mind begins to stir.

zugekiso.2.t:0 "Most Holy Pledge"
zugekiso.2.d:0 "Event from PoV of the priest and their family amongst the population awaiting to hear the news, forced there by the soldiers.

Very much done at a gunpoint, with anyone even slightly looking dejected being taken to the side."

zugekiso.3.t:0 "Unexpected Request"

The doors open and soldiers lead a skittish looking zebra in suit and glasses, who is led to Ekiso who stands up in smiles, dissmissing the soldiers. He shakes the hooves and welcomes Akyama, thanking the writer had time for the visit. Surpised, the writer mumbles a thanks before he is seated down and offered a drink. Ekiso continues on, saying how he is an admirer of his work, citing the Origin Theory especially; one that stipulates all zebras originally came from Ugabian lands before spreading to rest of Zebrica. Akyama, again, gives thanks in wonder of why he is even there. Ekiso will then ask why is it he then is unpopular amongst his collegues. Akyama gulps, citing that his research has been put to question by fellow collegues and historians. Quickly adding in most are gone now, having been mainly Gulu affiliated. Ekiso snorts, saying how their influence naturally wished to see Ugabi be out down. He continues on, saying how now that the realm is united and at peace, many changes are to come in Ugabi. He then drops the bombshell and asks if Akyama would be ready to aid the government in further research to Ugabi's history and the origin Theory. Stunned, Akyama doesn't respond but Ekiso quickly does add in he does have some questions. The researcher manages to mumble an affirmation."

About how Ugabi stands victorious and the dominant power in the Great Lakes. How this victory has come from tireless work of the army. Now, however, the time has come for UCTA to arise to yet another call of duty; the restore what has been lost. Most officers look confused but Ekiso continues on, citing how God had created zebras to live upon chosen lands, to graze and multiply to all corners of the land. But as they grew, so too did they become estranged from not just their past but God's infinite grace. Ugabi, however, has remained. The silence is heavy as the officers sit in awe, gawking at what the marshal is saying. Ekiso, in ecstatic mood, how the old wrongs must be righted.

Temples all across the land, even in occupied territories, are made to pay fealty to the deseaced Nnabakyala. Meanwhile new rumours stir about the empty throne; most of Mukisa's children have been vanishing or fleeing ever since UCTA took control, leaving only few weak-blooded around and the favoured candidate, Amanyi, Mukisa's eldest child, still resides in Re´em from where some rumours say he has refused to travel from back home. The uneasy situation has allowed even some claim that Ekiso intends to himself rise to the throne. No matter what is the case, the country lacks a monarch."

zugekiso.6.t:0 "Grand Imperial Declaration"
zugekiso.6.d:0 "Event about declaration of the Holy Ugabian Dominion by Ekiso in a grand royal-temple ceremony at the capital where he makes himself the Lord-Regent. He holds a speech about need for the realm to unify in loyalty to the Nnabakyalas, of whom there is only one and his name is Amanyi. This is followed by a frothing attack against Re´em, who he claims are keeping him away from his rightful throne. So he calls upon the warriors and soldiers of UCTA alongside all of Amanyi's loyal subjects to unite in freeing their sovereign from grasps of vile heretics who deny God's rule in Zebrica."

zugdiplo.3.d:0 "An event from POV of Amanyi receiving the bad news of Re´emian refusal. He should likely be saddened by this, since he genuenly does want to protect them. However, a part of his court feels like this is an insult upon the kingdom and king, with some sabre-rattlers wishing to make the foolish Re´emians submit by force. Amanyi should be more on the side of avoiding war, however a part of him does think that a brief conflict to make them submit would ensure the city he loves will be protected into the far future."

ZUG_past_warfare:0 "Gaze Into Past"
ZUG_past_warfare_desc:0 "While modern warfare is an entirely different ordeal to past this doesn't discount old tales and records. With the downfall of UCTA's dominance and with it adherence to modernity, the royal army is in prime position to inspect alternative means of war and combat."

ZUG_restructure_army_hierarchy_desc:0 "The modern nature of war is not made from the top down, it will be the individual heroes of the battlefield, acting with their squads to take hardpoints and hold off the enemy.

Our soldier must know that their faith in God the protector shall guide them in their service of Ugabi. So our soldiers shall go forth with new faith in heart, knowing they are doing God's will in their service."

ZUG_integrated_faith:0 "God and Army"
ZUG_integrated_faith_desc:0 "Many of the nation's most faithful are already members of our army. We can use this by encouraging the personal faith of our soldiers and previding them with chaplains through which to channel their divine belief. Fighting with renewed vigor, our soldiers shall know this mantra:\n§RTheir gun is God's blade, their resolve, His weapon, their soul, His alone.§!"

ZUG_new_regiment_model:0 "New Regiment Formations"
ZUG_new_regiment_model_desc:0 "Marshal Ekiso has placed forth a plan for the creation of new regiment formations based on his understanding of modern war. This is probably his least controversial military proposal and includes modernizing and updating the equipment for various infantry formations and further specializing his New Model Regiments."

ZUG_expand_tank_corps:0 "Expand the Tank Brigade"
ZUG_expand_tank_corps_desc:0 "Ugabi's armored forces are the cornerstone of the UCTA's military successes. While they are still far behind the rest of the world's armored corps, it shouldn't be hard to get our program up to speed. With intense research, we can ensure we will have the best, and possibly only armored forces in the great lakes, ensuring our domination."

ZUG_infantry_support_armor:0 "Shield of the Attack"
ZUG_infantry_support_armor_desc:0 "The Infantry Tank stands ready to revolutionize the concept of the infantry attack into a new form of warfare. Serving as the shield of the infantry, we can now have formations attack in small units with one or two tanks, and they will be protected as they advance to destroy our enemies."

ZUG_spearhead_armor:0 "Tip of the Charge"
ZUG_spearhead_armor_desc:0 "Armored spearheads will be the best way to use our tanks in these new days of modern war. Breaking through the lines of the enemy to encircle and crush them, this is the pinnacle of armored warfare, and we must ensure that our tank regiments operate as such."

ZUG_tank_trials:0 "Experiment and Test New Models"
ZUG_tank_trials_desc:0 "While we have imported our tank designs from other powers for a long time, it is time for the UCTA to begin developing its own armored designs. A new UCTA development team will be created to begin the work of placing our theoretical designs for new armor into practical use, and with these new vehicles, Ugabi shall triumph."

ZUG_modern_warfare:0 "Cult of Armoured Warfare"
ZUG_modern_warfare_desc:0 "While the description that some of our officers have given to our military strategy, that it is a "Cult" around armored war is incredibly heretical in all forms, we can not deny that the concept of mobile, modern war has become an obsession of the UCTA. It is time to make this impression a reality, and truly embrace all facets of this type of warfare."

ZUG_olukalu_charge:0 "Olukalu's Charge"
ZUG_olukalu_charge_desc:0 "A pecualiar doctorine —or rather a self-realized theory— by officer Olukalu is one of continued aggression against the foe. Through this one will ultimately achieve a breakthrough by eliminating your foe's chance to recover and stabilize their frontlines. An individual soldier will put aside their person and merge with their comrades into an unbreakable force."

ZUG_updated_tactics:0 "Emphasize Aggressive Tactics"
ZUG_updated_tactics_desc:0 "If we are not on the offense at all times, then we are fighting war wrong. We shall never let our enemies take from us like the Mazwi, and the Yetis did! We shall refine our war down to the bone and ensure that all Ugabi soldiers know, they must advance, at all costs, and inflict defeat upon the enemy. And if they fail? They shall attack again, to give their lives with honor so that Ugabi may yet prosper without them."

ZUG_storm_weapons:0 "Overwhelming Firepower"
ZUG_storm_weapons_desc:0 "War is destruction, this is a simple fact that must be acknowledged by all soldiers and commanders. And since this is true, we must ensure that our weapons are in peak form to ensure this destruction comes about in the name of God, wiping clean the slates of our enemies and purifying them in a storm of fire and wrath."

ZUG_motorization:0 "Army On Wheels"
ZUG_motorization_desc:0 "Motorizing our army is the key to ensuring top combat performance. Together with our doctrines of offense and self-sacrifice we can give our soldiers the tools they need to realize the full extend of Marshal Olukalu's military plans. Decisive movement shall combine with decisive attack to produce a winning strategy for Ugabi."

ZUG_spread_propaganda:0 "Leaflets and Speeches"
ZUG_spread_propaganda_desc:0 "Our army must know why we fight! We fight for the preservation of Ugabi! All who stand against our great nation stand against the will of God and our inevitable victory! All soldiers must have a fire that burns in their hearts to see our destiny fulfilled, and so they shall have the courage to make it so."

ZUG_virtue_aggression:0 "Virtue of Aggression"
ZUG_virtue_aggression_desc:0 "Aggression is now ingrained in our tactics through the reforms of the brave Marshal Olukalu. But now we must engrain it within our soldiers. We shall value those who show more aggression, more violence, and encourage this behavior in training exercises. So that when war comes to Ugabi, our enemies will face the most furious fighters in Zebrica."

ZUG_morale_officers:0 "Introduce Morale Officers"
ZUG_morale_officers_desc:0 "In order to maintain morale and our army's core principles, Olukalu has created a corps of Morale Officers who's job it is to keep the Marshal's ideals alive in the army, and keep it loyal to the state. They shall promote our ideas of aggression amongst the soldiers, and ensure that if any soldier considers cowardice, they know what is behind them may be worse than what is ahead."

ZUG_dead_individuality:0 "Death of Individuality"
ZUG_dead_individuality_desc:0 "Each individual soldier, while important, is not to be seen as some heroic singular factor. An army operates in units, comrades fighting together to achieve objectives. War is a game of statistics and destruction, and our high command must approach it as such. There is no worth in reminiscing on individual lives, and all military staff, from generals to privates, must be aware of that."

ZUG_relentless_attacks:0 "Without Mercy for Others and Self"
ZUG_relentless_attacks_desc:0 "Mercy is a tool of the old age of feudal chivalry, with no place in modern war. Soldiers now must be entirely selfless regarding pain and death, forgoing their own emotions and thoughts in service of the greater aim of victory. Their death and suffering is in the place of greater suffering for their comrades, and all pain and death they inflict alleviates the pain upon Ugabi's soul. And by God, may they not hurt Ugabi."

ZUG_officer_purity:0 "Ensure Officer Loyalties"
ZUG_officer_purity_desc:0 "Only the most faithful and dedicated can serve in our officer corps. They must have proven themselves worthy of serving both Ugabi and God, by understanding the Marshal's realities of war. Since for God's chosen nation, there is no alternative to these truths, and there is no point in waging war any other way."

ZUG_daredo_brigades:0 "Dare-Do Brigades"
ZUG_daredo_brigades_desc:0 "Those soldiers who have failed to exemplify our doctrine before, or have failed to accept the truths of the Marshal have one chance to make up for their failure. Participation in the Dare-Do brigades, for one final assault against the enemy, for one final victory.\n\n§LIn death, peace. In life, shame. In God, atonement.§!"

ZUG_soldier_oath:0 "Oath of Death"
ZUG_soldier_oath_desc:0 "In the blackest days, and in the deepest nights, in Ugabi's days of strife, for not myself shall my life go, but for the nation, the army, for the God who loves me so.\n\n§LAnd so this oath, on fields of blood made, shall make my flesh strong, and my spirit saved.§!"

ZUG_curry_favors:0 "Curry Favors"
ZUG_curry_favors_desc:0 "Even if the richest zebra in Ugabi, Mukisa irregardless must lower herself to pleasing keu figures in the royal court and the landed elites that formally are under her rule. While it might make her look weak for now, it will give her more political capital to achieve other goals."

ZUG_mukisa_play_court:0 "Court Intrigue"
ZUG_mukisa_play_court_desc:0 "The Court of Nnabakyala, whilst gilded in gold and silver, has been a den of sycophant appeasers and backstabbing courtiers seeking to elevate themselves higher in the court ranks. Mukisa knows this all too well, much like her ancestors. But she also knows that a spoken sentence here and an implying whisper elsewhere can be a powerful weapons to either strenghten her position or to weaken her opponents."

ZUG_mukisa_military_sabotage:0 "Sabotage Military's Businesses"
ZUG_mukisa_military_sabotage_desc:0 "UCTA controls not only many divisions and large swaths of land but also industrial sites that cater to their needs. By sabotaging this production with the help of her merchant allies, Mukisa can undermine military's capabilities to secure arms and cause the officers to squabble over the remaining goods to their detriment."

ZUG_mukisa_cause_strife_to_gulu:0 "Cause Strife Amongst Gulu Leadership"
ZUG_mukisa_cause_strife_to_gulu_desc:0 "While Gulu Clique may appear outwards as an united front, its leadership is filled with nobles and thinkers that disagree on policies. With her new tribal allies, she has gained access to a backchannel to their inner circles and can take an advantage of these disagreements by false letters and targeted rumours to break the faction's unity."

ZUG_mukisa_radio_broadcasts:0 "Speak to Ugabi"
ZUG_mukisa_radio_broadcasts_desc:0 "It is clear Ugabians wish to hear more wisdom from their sovereign and Mukisa is only happy to bridge the gap with help of modern innovations.

ZUG_mukisa_heralds:0 "Send Out the Heralds"
ZUG_mukisa_heralds_desc:0 "The Blessed Heralds are an age-old tradition by which the Nnabakyala have spread news to the entire nation. By using these heralds, Mukisa can sway many traditionalist commoners to her side."

### Starting ideas

ZUG_territorial_army:0 "Ugabi Central Territorial Army"
ZUG_territorial_army_desc:0 "The UCTA was created in 990 to liberate Ugabi from Mazwi vassalage by Nnabakyala Mukisa. Zebras were sent to Saddle Arabian military academies while foreign arms were purchased for the modern regiments. Yet, it was all for naught as the Storm King razed Mazwi, shattering the large realm and freeing Ugabi. This left the new army without a purpose yet a powerful position in the free nation, enough to rival the monarchy itself. Over the years, UCTA has only grown in influence, directly taking control of economy in key areas and only paying lipservice to the ruler."

ZUG_gulu_tablet:0 "The Gulu Tablet Convention"
ZUG_gulu_tablet_desc:0 "In 1001, Nnabakyala Mukisa signed the Gulu Tablet that ended slavery in Ugabi lands to secure support of an abolitionist coalition to counter the army's growing influence. Over the years, however, the original abolitionist coalition has grown into a broad alliance for further reforms. More alarmingly, many of its leaders are also chieftains of influential eastern tribes and this has given the movement legitimacy even amongst the traditional elite."
