ZUG_earth_celebration_desc:0 "The yearly festival to calm the ancestral spirits and celebrate our Earth's birthday are coming to close. All across the land, the subjects of the enlightened Nnabakyala Mukisa gather to hear her heralds in the villages whilst the capital awaits for her appearance."

ZUG_address_fears:0 "Fear of New"
ZUG_address_fears_desc:0 "The sad fact is that Ugabi is leagues backwards compared to the northern and western realms. But even as some small innovations have arrived to the state this development has caused alarm in the population. Mukisa must address these feelings."

ZUG_modern_innovations:0 "The Wonder Tool"
ZUG_modern_innovations_desc:0 "Motorized vehicles are nothing new to the Ugabi population. But what was once seen as but a weapon of war has seen a new development in the form of a tractor in the fields. Seeing the success and popularity of the new tool, Mukisa will export more of them and gift them to the people at her own expense."

ZUG_western_railroad:0 "The Western Railroad"
ZUG_western_railroad-desc:0 "Kamarela-Ruguzu railroad; what had once been a dear project of her father lays still in ruins, destroyed and razed by the Storm King's invasion. Mukisa had always desired to rebuild it but UCTA's control of the western region has made this impossible. If she even did rebuild it, what would stop the military from taking control of it? But with the Summit approaching, the railroad could prove an useful tool against the military."

ZUG_eastern_fields:0 "The Eastern Marshes"
ZUG_eastern_fields_desc:0 "In Kargaweze most of the land is made up of useless marshes. For decades there have been plans to drain these lands so that they might be used for farming but nothing has come to fruition so far. These broken promises have garnered ill will amongst the locals, leading to many to support the Gulu clique. Mukisa will openly declare that it is in her plans to finally see the swamps be drained."

ZUG_industrious_subjects:0 "Celebrate the Industrious Subjects"
ZUG_industrious_subjects_desc:0 "While we might be backwards in eyes of the world there are those in Ugabi who have not remained idle. These forward thinking zebras and their work should be remembered."

ZUG_farmers_to_workers:0 "Protect the Labourers"
ZUG_farmers_to_workers_desc:0 "One of the main issues hailed by the Gulu clique is the rights of labourers for fair rents and laws that protect them from abuse by their landlords. On the paper these are fair and just demands but these issues have been turned into weapons against Mukisa's rightful reign by the so-called reformers. It is best to disarm them at once."

ZUG_enflame_western_unrest:0 "Spread Whispers in the West"
ZUG_enflame_western_unrest_desc:0 "Western Ugabi lay in ruin and unrest under the tyrannical hoof of the UCTA. The soldiers do nothing but harass villages and commit crimes without fear of any punishment. Any protests have been quelled violently. But Mukisa knows her subjects will act if called upon, and the time for that approaches."

ZUG_discredit_clique:0 "Discredit the Clique"
ZUG_discredit_clique_desc:0 "The Gulu clique claim to be acting for the sake of common zebra. In truth, they are nothing but an opportunist lot who seek power for the sake of power like the UCTA. Mukisa will let her subjects know the truth so they will know to whom their loyalty should belong to."

ZUG_sway_key_reformers:0 "Meet the Reasonable Zebras"
ZUG_sway_key_reformers_desc:0 "A letter has arrived to Mukisa through one of her spies. It is a request for a secretive meeting by a group of reformers who wish to parlay with her in good faith. This is a chance Mukisa will accept."

ZUG_entice_traders:0 "Entice the Traders"
ZUG_entice_traders_desc:0 "The desolation brought by the Storm King left the old trade routes broken and brought ruination to old caravans. But a slow recovery has seen the trade network re-open and link Ugabi to the world at large. While it has brought wealth, it has also introduced dangerous foreign ideas that challenge the throne. To counter this, Mukisa will seek to align the traders to her reign with monopoly rights and luctrative tariff reliefs."

ZUG_court_parlays:0 "The Court of Nnabakyala"
ZUG_court_parlays_desc:0 "As part of her daily duties, Mukisa holds court in her royal palace. One part of this a public forum where any subject can appeal to her for justice or seek wisdom. Behind the throne, however, ears are kept open for any ill rumours while lavish meetings are held for the influential to keep them loyal to the throne."

ZUG_hear_merchants:0 "Hear the Merchants"
ZUG_hear_merchants_desc:0 "A group of merchants has recently appealed to the throne for an amend to an edict concerning foreign trade. Mukisa shall listen to what they'll have to say and pass her judgement."

ZUG_modern_friends:0 "To A New Friendship!"
ZUG_modern_friends_desc:0 "Even if part of the traditional elite, Mukisa can feel where the wind is blowing; the ascendance of merchants who are learned in modern arts has created a new powerbase without ancient lineages. An asset that would be most useful in the future."

ZUG_listen_nobles:0 "Host the Nobles"
ZUG_listen_nobles_desc:0 "Part of Mukisa's duties is to host lavish parties for the nobles to showcase her wealth and power. One such party has been planned, and Mukisa intends for this one to be especially grand."

ZUG_traditional_allies:0 "To A Continued Alliance!"
ZUG_traditional_allies_desc:0 "As the old proverb goes, one should not play with fire. The ancient clans and capital nobility are an established powerbase and it would be foolish to risk their ire. Instead, Mukisa will ensure their loyalty and friendship to secure her plans."

ZUG_royal_authority:0 "Power of the Throne"
ZUG_royal_authority_desc:0 "Ugabi might be an union of many clans but there is only one Nnabakyala — and her name is Mukisa."

ZUG_charitable_leader:0 "One Who Cares for All"
ZUG_charitable_leader_desc:0 "The Nnabakyala have always cared for teir subjects but has there ever been such a charitable leader lie Mukisa? Her wealth has seen the poor be fed, roads be made and the fields be protected from fiends. Her wealth is Ugabi's wealth, one and the same."

ZUG_liberation_icon:0 "One Who Led the Liberation"
ZUG_liberation_icon_desc:0 "Ugabi would never have been freed without the work of the venerated Mukisa. It was she who created the armed forces who pushed the invaders out. It was she who freed the slaves from their chains. Without her, there would be no Ugbai today and she will let her subjects know this."

ZUG_repay_loyalty:0 "Riches to the Loyal"
ZUG_repay_loyalty_desc:0 "TODO"

ZUG_royal_estates:0 "Loyal Subjects"
ZUG_royal_estates_desc:0 "Much land across Ugabi belongs to the throne and most are occupied by local farming communities.

ZUG_visible_monarchy:0 "The Modern Approach"
ZUG_visible_monarchy_desc:0 "Mukisa has seen fit to become more approachable to her subjects all across Ugabi. While for years she has held festivals in the capital that have been commemorated by heralds in her name, she now wishes to speak to the directly with the help of modern technology."

ZUG_popular_sovereign:0 "Popular Sovereignty"
ZUG_popular_sovereign_desc:0 "No ruler cannot rule if their subjects oppose them. Mukisa has come to realize the power she can gain by garnering the support of her subjects directly instead of through the traditional chieftains. While they may retain their positions, the throne will become closer to its subjects and earn their unquestioning devotion."

ZUG_damned_traitors_desc:0 "TODO"

ZUG_ancestral_guidance:0 "One With the Ancestors"
ZUG_ancestral_guidance_desc:0 "As it was and shall be, the Nnabakyala acts as the link between the living and the dead. Her person unites the present, past and the future into one being. Who would dare to question such a vessel of wisdom?"

ZUG_watchful_spirits:0 "The Watchful Spirits"
ZUG_watchful_spirits_desc:0 "Us mortals cannot escape attention of our forebears even after their depature. They watch and protect us. Yet they also punish the wicked and cruel. To betray the Nnabakyala is a crime against the Sky himself and the traitor's soul is cast aside by the winds upon death, never to exist again. Who would risk such damnation?"

ZUG_divine_agents:0 "Loyal Priesthood"
ZUG_divine_agents_desc:0 "Of all the factions in Ugabi, the priests of the Sky and various other religious officials remain staunchly loyal to Mukisa and the institution she stands for. Some have already taken the initiative to wield their influence over the masses by preaching loyalty to their Nnabakyala and how one must be ready to even cast aside their chieftains if they are to oppose her rule. Such forward thinking must be repaid."

ZUG_blessed_dynasty:0 "Blessed By the God"
ZUG_blessed_dynasty_desc:0 "It is clear that the Sky favours Nnabakyala Mukisa. Her dynasty has ruled Ugabi since time immemorial, surviving while other rulers and clans have been vanquished. Now, she stands above all as a divinely ordained ruler, one who speaks with voice of countless ancestors and is connected to the god himself. To serve her is a privilege and every devout subject stands ready to fulfill her commands."

ZUG_absolutism:0 "My Name is Mukisa"
ZUG_absolutism_desc:0 "Ugabi is nothing without its ruler, and that ruler is Mukisa. Anyone who dares to oppose her rule is nothing but a filthy traitor who should be opposed at all costs. Her subjects are devoted to her and know that under her rule they will see Ugabi rise in glory over the others."

ZUG_plan_tour:0 "Announce the Royal Tour"
ZUG_plan_tour_desc:0 "Amidst the great stir over the upcoming Summer Summit, Mukisa has also declared her intention to tour the land and visit the local chieftains. This way will she not only bring the throne closer to the common zebra but also allow her to convince the chieftains to support her in the future."

ZUG_give_gifts:0 "Give Generous Gifts"

ZUG_see_warbands:0 "Hear the Warriors' Deeds"
ZUG_see_warbands_desc:0 "Along the royal tour, Mukisa has seen fit to invite the traditional clan warriors to show their allegiance to her at the capital."

ZUG_invite_into_royal_guard:0 "Recruit the Bravest and Strongest"
ZUG_invite_into_royal_guard_desc:0 "The royal Horn Guardians are the traditional household soldiers of the Nnabakyala, meant to protect both the royal family and the Golden Horn. But after Storm King's invasion the guard were left in disgrace due to loss of the ancient artifact. But with some incentives and flattery, Mukisa will see more recruits join its ranks."

ZUG_expand_traditional_rights:0 "Expand Traditional Clan Rights and Lands"
ZUG_expand_traditional_rights_desc:0 "As a show of well-being and benelovence Mukisa will expand the traditional rights given to the named clans of Ugabi and gift royal lands to them. In truth, however, most of the rights will be rather superficial, dealing only in specific local matters, and the lands are mostly backwater territories currently unused."

ZUG_commemorate_liberation:0 "Commemorate Liberation "
ZUG_commemorate_liberation_desc:0 "Ugabi is a free realm and answers to no foreign overlord. But this freedom was not truly achieved by our own strenght; the original invasion by the Storm King's saw light casualties but also loss of the Golden Horn whereas the later 'liberation' spearheaded by the UCTA simply removed the few yeti garrisons and secured our borders. Truth, however, matters little to her subjects and a beautiful lie serves a better purpose for Mukisa."

ZUG_sudden_visit:0 "At the Barracks"
ZUG_sudden_visit_desc:0 "The Ugabi Central Territorial Army might be united by their belief of superioirity they are, in reality, fractured into multiple power groups, each ruled by a powerful officer. While some are large, others are small. One of these smaller forces, however, happens to be located quite close to the capital and Mukisa has seen fit to pay them a visit."

ZUG_secure_arms:0 "Tactics and Gunpowder"
ZUG_secure_arms_desc:0 "Courage and will alone will not win battles. Modern warfare has no room for the old ways. Something that the accursed UCTA has proven time and again. But a question remains; why let them have the monopoly to this power?"

ZUG_eastern_spies:0 "Pay Attention to the East"
ZUG_eastern_spies_desc:0 "It is important to not ignore the Gulu Clique's military assets either. Rumours speak of hidden arms caches in the swamps that are ready to be wielded by an army of revolutionaries blinded by their own self-righteousness. Even if the truth may be stretched, it would be foolish to not heed them."

ZUG_host_military_officers:0 "Host the Honourable Officers"
ZUG_host_military_officers_desc:0 "A recent announcement has raised quite a few eyebrows across Ugabi. Mukisa has seen fit to hold a banquet at the capital dedicated entirely to honouring the achievements of the UCTA. On the guest list are officers from the military and amongst them is a particular marshall Mukisa is keen to have a talk with."

### Power struggle events

zugstart.1.t:0 "Her Vision"
zugstart.1.d:0 "Event where Mukisa is led to the ceremonial platform by the royal entourage whilst the crowds cheer. There she holds a speech declaring the festivals to be done and, as per tradition, what her vision (essentially what the visiting spirit of the previous Nnabakyala, her father, showed her). In it she saw Ugabi be ravaged by storms and earthquakes, only to give away to a city of gold. She explains that this must mean that Ugabi will face difficult times in the following year but that, in the end, all will be better. After this she plays her role as Nnabakyala and blows the ceremonial horn (replacement one, as the original was taken by the Storm King) which is followed by a spectacular fireworks show, awing the crowds."
zugstart.1.a:0 "Three cheers to our Nnabakyala!"

zugstart.2.t:0 "Tumultuous Spring"
zugstart.2.d:0 "Follow-up event where Mukisa is in her private parlour, reading reports about the military expanding bandit hnting activities to yet another village (read as them just beginning to extort it) and a certain high ranking Gulu clique reformer has escaped house captivity. Mukisa essentially explains to herself and the player the tumultuous political situation Ugabi is in and how either the military or the Gulu clique can move her aside if they gain the power and popularity. To counter this, she has a plan. She will summon the Clans to a summit in the early summer where she will call upon them to reneve their oaths to her and therefore enforce her authority publicly to the nation. However, she will need to cement her position over the spring and make sure neither faction will be powerful enough to oppose her. If Mukisa plays her cards right, then she will be truly in charge of Ugabi."
zugstart.2.a:0 "Let the game begin."

zugstart.3.t:0 "Unfounded Fears"
zugstart.3.d:0 "In the event Mukisa is walking outside the capital on one of her fields where a Maregyptian tractor is being shown to her by a pony engineer. Her royal entourage whisper in the back while further away commoners watch the happening. In her mind Mukisa wonders why there is such a fuzz over such a simple machine but she knows the commoner fears the machines due to the military using them for war. She asks the engineer if anyone can drive such a machine. Given a yes, she tells a guard to fetch the oldest commoner in the crowd. That commoner is then ordered by Mukisa to climb onto the tractor alongside the pony engineer. After a while, the vehicle comes active and begins to drive, operated by the old zebra. This should break fear amongst the common masses, who now look in amazement, especially as the tractor breaks the soil so easily."
zugstart.3.a:0 "A tool is a tool, and nothing more."

zugstart.4.t:0 "An Unusual Strike"
zugstart.4.d:0 "A backfire event for the railroad scheme. Essentially, local workers are refusing to work citing bad work conditions, In reality, some soldiers from the UCTA are holding them back, wanting to be paid. But giving them pay would mean a public humiliation whereas not paying them will stall production, leading to further costs for the royal treasure, even more than the bribe demanded."
zugstart.4.a:0 "§RJust give them the damned gift to make them go.§!"
zugstart.4.b:0 "YRPWe must bide our time for now.§!"

zugstart.5.t:0 "Report Review"
zugstart.5.d:0 "A backfire event where the comission sent to review and plan the drainign process. It has, however, become obvious that there's been serious misscalculations done; it is simply impossible to fulfill the lofty goals with the current budget. This leaves Mukisa with two options; either she downscales her plans but raise ire of the locals, certainly making some go back to the Gulu faction, or increase the comission's budget from her own wealth."
zugstart.5.a:0 "§OPerhaps some plans can be backscaled?§!"
zugstart.5.b:0 "YRDip into the royal treasury to fulfil the plans.§!"

zugstart.6.t:0 "Unfounded Fears"
zugstart.6.d:0 "In the event a griot finishes telling a tale in a Western Ugabian village. Afterwards, she continues on to tell about Mukisa, her wealth and fierce prowess. How her rule is wise and just. Essentially tells propaganda of her reign, and how the locals should never forget how their Nnabakyala is still their rightful overlord. Should cause some to leave, out of fear for reprisals from the military while others, silently, avert her gaze. She should make a mental note at the end how she needs to leave when everyone's asleep, or risk meeting end of a barrel the coming morning."
zugstart.6.a:0 "Thankless work, even if for a good pay."

zugstart.7.t:0 "Claims Gone Too Far"
zugstart.7.d:0 "A backfire event where the rumours meant to discredit and ruin image of the Gulu reformers has spilled over to Mukisa's own faction; an influential court noble is accused of being a foul cultist due to a past association to a Gulu reformer accused of being one too. By law this should lead to a trial by the temple, so that the accused is either punished or proven innocent. Problem is that Mukisa knows this noble's daughter is also a member in the military and her spies say he plans to escape to the military's camp if a trial is arranged. But if she does not follow up on charge, she will be seen as weak and unjust, favouring her courtiers over the laws."
zugstart.7.a:0 "§YSay nothing on the matter.§!"
zugstart.7.b:0 "§RArrange for a trial.§!"

zugstart.8.t:0 "Clandestine Meeting"
zugstart.8.d:0 "In the event Mukisa has a meeting with two important Gulu reformers who have come to parlay with her. In return for implementing certain reforms and decrees in the future, she will have their support. Mukisa should bark back, calling some of them such as an elected assembly an affront to her God's blessed rule. She counters by admitting that she sees wisdom in some of their wishes, even going as far as calling them true Ugabians for daring to oppose her to see Ugabi rise. But she calls them fools for forgetting to whom the right to rule belongs and how their ideas of collective rule will simply give rise to anarchy. She tells them that she will agree to heed their advice in the future and raise them to be her councillors. The two ultimately agree to her, severly culling Gulu Clique's leadership."
zugstart.8.a:0 "A fruitful discussion."

zugstart.9.t:0 "Love and Lust"
zugstart.9.d:0 "An event where Mukisa's day in the court is overwhelmed by a fierce debate over an incident that had occured in the capital. Two zebras ended up in a drunken argument over some shared love interest, over which they ended up having a fight over that spilled over into a massive group-on-group riot. Issue for Mukisa is, however, that both defendants come from her rivalling factions and while supporting one will lower influence of the loosing faction it will also increase influence of the winner's side. But as the room comes to a silence, Mukisa must make a choice."
zugstart.9.a:0 "§OThe officer caused this entire situation.§!"
zugstart.9.b:0 "§RChieftain's daughter was in the wrong.§!"

zugstart.10.t:0 "Gift Baskets"
zugstart.10.d:0 "An event where a remote village in the backskirts is awoken to a visit by Nnabakyala's dignitaries. They announce that Mukisa is very pleased with the village's dedication to duty and loyalty, citing their bountiful harvests, on-time taxes and merit gained by some zebras originally from the village. The officials then begin to hand out baskets full of food, cloth linen, money, tools and other needed commodities."
zugstart.10.a:0 "Loyalty to one's better will bring due rewards."

zugstart.11.t:0 "Reforged Spirits"
zugstart.11.d:0 "An event where a border village close to UCTA's lands is being harassed and extorted by a platoon of soldiers. This time, however, the villagers are less subdued. Not so meek. This makes the leading officer curious, who happens to spot one elderly granny just chuckling and demands to know what is funny. The old mare replies and says that times are changing. That once again, Ugabi will be ruled by old laws and God's blessing. How the land will thrive after a cleansing fire. This irks the officer, who spats backs and calls her a deranged hag. A villager takes a step forward, only to be violently shoved back with a rifle. The old mare, irregardless, keeps on laughing and even as the soldiers depart on top their car, the laughter seems to trail after them."
zugstart.11.a:0 "What a loony granny."

zugstart.12.t:0 "Divine Right"
zugstart.12.d:0 "An event where a remote village in the backskirts all the villagers have gathered to see and listen to a travelling priest bearing standard of the Nnabakyala. She tells them how the ancestral spirits are restless and angry. For they see Ugabi suffering from disloyalty and greed. Where zebras no longer heed call of the God and the sovereign God has put to rule over the land. These spirits will not rest, until Ugabi will once again stand behind God's chosen, the one who speaks with the spirits. All good subjects must heed this call, for only damnation and ruination will await those who oppose."
zugstart.12.a:0 "So wills God!"

zugstart.13.t:0 "Dreadful Drill"
zugstart.13.d:0 "An event telling about some new recruit's morning training in the UCTA at some fort in western Ugabi. Mood and sprits are particularly low, as despite a limited lockdown by the officers they have all heard the same; Curse Tablets bearing marks cursing all the traitors and enemies of Ugabi. The recruit in question recalls the horror she'd seen in her village, how her former neighbours and even own family acted like she was some accursed being. Their looks haunt her sleep and make her doubt. But a swift lash strike from an officer brings her out from daydreaming and focus back on the drills."
zugstart.13.a:0 "I need a drink."

zugstart.14.t:0 "Royal Splendour"
zugstart.14.d:0 "An event about a royal parade being organised in the capital to the awe of the people. At first not all too out of the ordinary but Mukisa's appearance shatters this; unlike her normal appearance, she is now clad in ceremonial armor, with her face painted in blue like the Ugabian rulers don in their ascension ceremony. She also wield the Pearl Sword, an ancient sword that was gifted to the hero Ekitala by God to beat back the cold demons and united the Ugabian tribes. Mukisa is descendant of this hero."
zugstart.14.a:0 "All hail!"

### Summit Chaos event chain

zugchaos.1.t:0 "The Clans Gather"
zugchaos.1.d:0 "The starting event in the event chain for the political chaos; details how the clan chieftains, apart from some, have gathered at the royal palace for the summit. Meanwhile the otherwise bustling capital city has fallen oddly silent, as houses have been fortified, merchant stalls closed and the common people hide, as if expecting something. Tense rumours about the army mobilizing in the west and unlawful mob gatherings in the east have given a rise for alarm. Mukisa expected this and how only God knows what will happen in the following days."
zugchaos.1.a:0 "Time will show the answer."


### Mukisa victory

ZUG_mukisa_victorious:0 "Victory of Tradition"

ZUG_curry_favors:0 "Curry Favors"
ZUG_curry_favors_desc:0 "Even if the richest zebra in Ugabi, Mukisa irregardless must lower herself to pleasing keu figures in the royal court and the landed elites that formally are under her rule. While it might make her look weak for now, it will give her more political capital to achieve other goals."

ZUG_mukisa_play_court:0 "Court Intrigue"
ZUG_mukisa_play_court_desc:0 "The Court of Nnabakyala, whilst gilded in gold and silver, has been a den of sycophant appeasers and backstabbing courtiers seeking to elevate themselves higher in the court ranks. Mukisa knows this all too well, much like her ancestors. But she also knows that a spoken sentence here and an implying whisper elsewhere can be a powerful weapons to either strenghten her position or to weaken her opponents."

ZUG_mukisa_military_sabotage_desc:0 "UCTA controls not only many divisions and large swaths of land but also industrial sites that cater to their needs.

ZUG_mukisa_cause_strife_to_gulu_desc:0 "While Gulu Clique may appear outwards as an united front, its leadership is filled with nobles and thinkers that disagree on policies.

ZUG_mukisa_heralds:0 "Send Out the Heralds"
ZUG_mukisa_heralds_desc:0 "The Blessed Heralds are an age-old tradition by which the Nnabakyala have spread news to the entire nation. By using these heralds, Mukisa can sway many traditionalist commoners to her side."

### Starting ideas

ZUG_territorial_army:0 "Ugabi Central Territorial Army"
ZUG_territorial_army_desc:0 "The UCTA was created in 990 to liberate Ugabi from Mazwi vassalage by Nnabakyala Mukisa. Zebras were sent to Saddle Arabian military academies while foreign arms were purchased for the modern regiments. Yet, it was all for naught as the Storm King razed Mazwi, shattering the large realm and freeing Ugabi. This left the new army without a purpose yet a powerful position in the free nation, enough to rival the monarchy itself. Over the years, UCTA has only grown in influence, directly taking control of economy in key areas and only paying lipservice to the ruler."

ZUG_gulu_tablet:0 "The Gulu Tablet Convention"
ZUG_gulu_tablet_desc:0 "In 1001, Nnabakyala Mukisa signed the Gulu Tablet that ended slavery in Ugabi lands to secure support of an abolitionist coalition to counter the army's growing influence. Over the years, however, the original abolitionist coalition has grown into a broad alliance for further reforms.
