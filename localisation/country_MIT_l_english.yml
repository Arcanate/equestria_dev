 ### NATIONAL FOCUS ######

 MIT_historic_claims:0 "Operation Odysseus"
 MIT_historic_claims_desc:0 "After decades of planning the time has come to finally launch Operation Odysseus, the reconquering of the last four states of the old Asterion Confederation still under foreign occupation. The whole of the nation is dedicated to this one task, when it is finally complete we will be able to move on with the rest of our issues."
 MIT_begin_CYA_reintergration:0 "Restore the Asterion Mainland"
 MIT_begin_CYA_reintergration_desc:0 "At long last we have reclaimed our mainland states. For over a century our people have dreamt of this, and now that dream has come true. However, much as changed in our abscence, and much of it has not been for the better. It's time to get to work."
 MIT_excecute_nobility:0 "Capital Punishment for the Nobility"
 MIT_excecute_nobility_desc:0 "For decades the so called nobility of the wicked County of Cyanolisia raped and piliaged the land. The time has come for them to pay for their crimes, and only one sentence is appropriate to punish them for their crimes. The nobility will be excecuted."
 MIT_nobility_exile:0 "Exile the Nobility"
 MIT_nobility_exile_desc:0 "Our people have been shocked by the horrors of the mainland, and by the contemptable behavior of the so called nobility. However, we can not bring their crimes to a true account, and therefor the best and most politically expedient answer is to exile them. They shall go and peace, and never return."
 MIT_nobility_forgiveness:0 "The Hardest Choice"
 MIT_nobility_forgiveness_desc:0 "The crimes committed against the people of the mainland states by the nobility placed over them by The Empire are incalculable. We can not therefor assign specific blame, and so we must come to the hardest decision anyone can make. We must forgive them, and allow them to go free. They shall never again hold power, but life on the bottom is still life."
 MIT_uproot_institutions:0 "Reinstitute Asterionese Governence"
 MIT_uproot_institutions_desc:0 "Now that the mainland is back under the control of our people after so many years in the dark and our government's direction is decided it's time to transition from military ocupation of the mainland to normal governence. This will be a long process, but it will be nothing compared to the years of vassalage."
 MIT_core_auropallieta:0 "Reintigrate Auropallieta"
 MIT_core_auropallieta_desc:0 "Auropallieta was the capital of the Imperial occupation, and has had much done to change its infrastructure and population. Temples of the old pantheon were torn down, Actualist advocates were imprisoned, and democratic philosophers were excecuted. It's time to heal the land and its people."
 MIT_core_cannabia:0 "Reintigrate Cannabia"
 MIT_core_cannabia_desc:0 "Once one of the wealthiest states in Asteiron, Cannabia's historical careful management of resources was thrown out the window by the Vassalage. While some might dispair, there is still life in those jungles, still minerals in those hills, still some souls left to carry on. The people need only be reminded of what they still have, and what they can get back."
 MIT_core_salmarkt:0 "Reintigrate Salmarkt"
 MIT_core_salmarkt_desc:0 "Salmarkt has long been at the intersection of cultures, but for even longer it was a core part of Asterion. It's time to remind the people of that fact."
 MIT_core_creeper_mountains:0 "Reintigrate the Creeper Mountains"
 MIT_core_creeper_mountains_desc:0 "The Creeper Mountain state was the furthest inland the old Asterionese Confederation ever got, and the people who lived there were a hearty group. Years of Imperial plundering of the mines followed by occupation by a bandit army has left the land in ruins. It's time to fix these problems, and restore order."
 MIT_cannabia_buildings:0 "Purchase Cannabian Land"
 MIT_cannabia_buildings_desc:0 "Now that Cannabia is once again part of Asterion officially the military can purchase land there. These plots of land will be very useful in defending the mainland thanks to their centralized location."
 MIT_minotaurian_mainland:0 "Asterion Reunited"
 MIT_minotaurian_mainland_desc:0 "After much time and effort the nation is once again whole. Recognition of this will pass not with the bang of celebration, but with the soft whimper of citizens sleeping soundly in their beds. They're finally back home, and nothing will ever change that."
 MIT_creeper_buildings:0 "Purchase Land in the Creeper Mountains"
 MIT_creeper_buildings_desc:0 "Since the Creeper Mountains are a natural defensive position it only makes sense for the military to purchase building rights there."
 MIT_auropallieta_buildings:0 "Purchase Land in Auropallieta"
 MIT_auropallieta_buildings_desc:0 "Due to the nearby border with Sicameon it only makes sense for plots of land to be purchased in Auropallieta. If nothing else this will further help erase the memory of The Empire from people's minds."
 MIT_salmarkt_buildings:0 "Purchase Land in Salmarkt"
 MIT_salmarkt_buildings_desc:0 "As the crossroads of civilization it only makes sense for Salmarkt to have a military presense."

 MIT_escort_construction:0 "Purchase Civilian Shipyards"
 MIT_escort_construction_desc:0 "As the time for retaking the mainland grows ever closer we must enlarge military ship production to provide the escorts and fire support needed for a successful anphibious assault. Purchases of civilian shipyards will allow for the facillitation of this once the shipyards have been properly converted."
 MIT_expand_the_MCG:0 "Expand the ACG"
 MIT_expand_the_MCG_desc:0 "For decades the Asterion Coast Guard has been the sword arm of the nation's anti-piracy operations. The image of guardsbulls leading the charge into pirate ships to rescue slaves and clean up the sapient garbage of the sea is an enduring image in the culture of Asterion. Expanding the organization will no doubt help preparations for the upcoming reclamation."
 MIT_amphibious_operations:0 "MIT_amphibious_operations"
 MIT_amphibious_operations_desc:0 "MIT_amphibious_operations_desc"
 MIT_smokeless_powder:0 "Smokeless Powder"
 MIT_smokeless_powder_desc:0 "For many years now smokeless powder has been the standard propellent of almost every single firearms cartrage in civilian hands, but the standard infantry weapons of the military have yet to advance in the time since the Fall of The Empire and the succession wars that followed. It's time for the continuing resolution and deadlocked committees. The military needs modern firearms, and it needs them now."
 MIT_army_doctrine:0 "Update the Army Doctrine"
 MIT_army_doctrine_desc:0 "The time of the Sovreignity War is long past, but experts from that war are still among us. Using the expertise of the famous Elite Four the ground combat doctrines currently in use shall be revolutionized into a new way of fighting. The opressors won't know what hit them."
 MIT_motor_infantry:0 "Mobile Infantry"
 MIT_motor_infantry_desc:0 "With the new 'automobiles' proving their worth in the private sector every day it's time we capitalize on them for the Asterionese military. Since the minotaurs that make up the majority of the troops don't have flight or magic manipulation mechanization will more than make up for any short comings."
 MIT_top_cover:0 "Top Cover"
 MIT_top_cover_desc:0 "With the Asterionese Air Force becoming more of a reality every day it's time for those valiant pilots to have homes to call their own. These new bases will greatly help us in the upcoming operation."
 MIT_paratroopers:0 "Airborne Divisions"
 MIT_paratroopers_desc:0 "The importation of a simple safety device for aircraft called a parachute has led our military planners to a startling conclusion. By giving these parachutes to soldiers and their equipment entire armies would be able to be inserted behind enemy lines to sow confusion. Should a sea landing become unviable these daring bulls of action will become invaluable."
 MIT_aircraft_supplies:0 "Synthetic Resources"
 MIT_aircraft_supplies_desc:0 "Whether they run on crystals, petrollium, or one of the more exotic power sources it is undeniable that aircraft require many resources to run that are just not found in sufficient numbers in Asterion. Therefor we must create our own supplies out of the resources we do have availible."

 MIT_review_navy_budget:0 "Review Navy Budget"
 MIT_review_navy_budget_desc:0 "With the mainland states liberated the time has come to focus the two houses of the Voulí on the task of addressing the military budgets long held in limbo. First up shall be the navy budget. With it addressed Asterion's pride can once more control the seas and protect the trade withotu pirate interference."
 MIT_new_rnd:0 "Open New Research and Development Facility"
 MIT_new_rnd_desc:0 "The current facilities for research are stellar, but limited by space. By building a new wing onto the complex we shall allow for more technologies to be researched simultaniously. Consequently, the overall speed of research will increase."
 MIT_start_healing:0 "Bridge Internal Divides"
 MIT_start_healing_desc:0 "Now that the land is once more whole we must start to do the same for the people. For years the population has seen itself divided along every possible line. No more."
 MIT_economic_law:0 "Revise General Military Spending"
 MIT_economic_law_desc:0 "With the world becoming ever more dangerous it is time we dealt with the issue of military spending. By moving to a higher state of mobilization we will be able to make better use of our already existing concrete factories, along with several other benefits."
 MIT_restart_the_air_force:0 "Restart the Air Force"
 MIT_restart_the_air_force_desc:0 "The Asterionese Air Force is the youngest of the service branches, and since its formation over a decade ago has languished with only a small number of aircraft and facilities. It's time to change all that with an actual budget for the service."
 MIT_review_army_budget:0 "Reform the Army Budget"
 MIT_review_army_budget_desc:0 "The grunt down in the muck is the bull taking and holding land, and it's been this way since time immemorial. However, modern war is far more complex than just infantry lines or even artillery. It's time the budget of the Asterionese Combined Land Army was revised to allow for the research and production of those new technologies."
 MIT_finish_healing:0 "Let This Be Our Last Battlefield"
 MIT_finish_healing_desc:0 "After years of political in-fighting and suspiction Asterion's people are finally at peace. No more shall they be at eachother's throats over differences in class, religion, politics, or urbanization. The nation will now stand united and shout to the world with one voice, 'Death to the Empire!'"
 MIT_open_immigration:0 "Open the Immigration Offices"
 MIT_open_immigration_desc:0 "Now that Asterion is back on her feet we can finally feel safe opening up the immigration offices. They will have to shed their old cultures to become Asterionese, but we are so confident in our culture that we doubt that absorbing them will be any problem."
 MIT_building_slots1:0 "Buying Kainourgio Spiti Land"
 MIT_building_slots1_desc:0 "As the largest of the islands in the Asterion Archepelago, Kainourgio Spiti has a a fair ammount of unused land still left over for development. By allowing the government to purchase there will will ensure our military dominace going forward."

 MIT_political_effort:0 "Make Asterion Great Again"
 MIT_political_effort_desc:0 "In politics perception is reality, if the government is to get anything done it must create the perception that something can get done at all. A simple slogan, something to inspire people, should give us just enough space to hire on someone who can actually get things done."

 MIT_democratic_alliance_desc:0 "In recent years there has been a movement to formalize our alliance with our democratic amigos in Sicameon to allow for military and logistic cooperation. In a world filled with monarchs, dictators, and evil wizards, it is argued, the free peoples of the world need to band together for defense against those who would see them as slaves. The Coalition of Sovereign Nations will evolve to become that band, and together we happy few shall make the world safe for liberty."

 MIT_oni:0 "Office of Nonstandard Interventions"
 MIT_oni_desc:0 "With the world becoming ever more dangerous we are faced with an uncomfortable truth which we can deny no longer - we are small.

Basil Zacharias shall be the first head of this agency."
 MIT_mercs:0 "Mercenary Review Commission"
