 ### NATIONAL FOCUS ######
 # Reclaimed Land
 MIT_historic_claims:0 "Operation Odysseus"
 MIT_historic_claims_desc:0 "After decades of planning the time has come to finally launch Operation Odysseus, the reconquering of the last four states of the old Asterion Confederation still under foreign occupation. The whole of the nation is dedicated to this one task, when it is finally complete we will be able to move on with the rest of our issues."
 MIT_begin_CYA_reintergration:0 "Restore the Asterion Mainland"
 MIT_begin_CYA_reintergration_desc:0 "At long last we have reclaimed our mainland states. For over a century our people have dreamt of this, and now that dream has come true. However, much as changed in our absence, and much of it has not been for the better. It's time to get to work."
 MIT_excecute_nobility:0 "Capital Punishment for the Nobility"
 MIT_excecute_nobility_desc:0 "For decades the so called nobility of the wicked County of Cyanolisia despoiled and pillaged the land. The time has come for them to pay for their crimes, and only one sentence is appropriate to punish them most severly."
 MIT_nobility_exile:0 "Exile the Nobility"
 MIT_nobility_exile_desc:0 "Our people have been shocked by the horrors of the mainland, and by the contemptible behavior of the so called nobility. However, we can not bring their crimes to a true account, and therefore the best and most politically expedient answer is to exile them. They shall go and peace, and never return."
 MIT_nobility_forgiveness:0 "The Hardest Choice"
 MIT_nobility_forgiveness_desc:0 "The crimes committed against the people of the mainland states by the nobility placed over them by The Empire are incalculable. We can not therefore assign specific blame, and so we must come to the hardest decision anyone can make. We must forgive them, and allow them to go free. They shall never again hold power, but life on the bottom is still life."
 MIT_uproot_institutions:0 "Reinstitute Asterionese Governance"
 MIT_uproot_institutions_desc:0 "Now that the mainland is back under the control of our people after so many years in the dark and our government's direction is decided, it's time to transition from military occupation of the mainland to normal governance. This will be a long process, but it will be nothing compared to the years of vassalage."
 MIT_core_auropallieta:0 "Reintegrate Auropallieta"
 MIT_core_auropallieta_desc:0 "During the unlawful occupation, the farmlands of Auropallieta were home to many resistance cells which fiercly fought against the imperialists and monarchists. They have welcomed us with open arms and are ready to rejoin Asterion proper."
 MIT_core_cannabia:0 "Reintegrate Cannabia"
 MIT_core_cannabia_desc:0 "Once one of the wealthiest states in Asterion, Cannabia's historical careful management of resources was thrown out the window by the Vassalage. While some might despair, there is still life in those jungles, still minerals in those hills, still some souls left to carry on. The people need only be reminded of what they still have, and what they can get back."
 MIT_core_salmarkt:0 "Reintegrate Salmarkt"
 MIT_core_salmarkt_desc:0 "Salmarkt has long been at the intersection of cultures, mainly of Asterionese and Prywhenian, but for even longer it was a core part of Asterion. It's time to remind the people of that fact."
 MIT_core_thym:0 "Reintegrate Néachóra"
 MIT_core_thym_desc:0 "Thymíaushafen was the capital of the Imperial occupation, and has had much done to change its infrastructure and population. Temples of the old pantheon were torn down, Actualist advocates were imprisoned, and democratic philosophers were executed. It's time to heal the land and its people of its wounds and eradicate traces of past oppression."
 MIT_core_creeper_mountains:0 "Reintegrate the Creeper Mountains"
 MIT_core_creeper_mountains_desc:0 "The Creeper Mountain state was the furthest inland the old Asterionese Confederation ever got, and the minotaurs who lived there were a hearty group, bravely guarding the frontier of Asterion from foreign invaders. Years of Imperial plundering of the mines followed by occupation by a bandit army has left the land in ruins. The minotaurs who remain greet us with open arms as liberators, and it is our duty to aid them."
 MIT_cannabia_buildings:0 "Tame The Jungle"
 MIT_cannabia_buildings_desc:0 "Now that Cannabia is once again part of Asterion officially we can begin the process of restoring the region to its former glory. Mass deforestation and draining of marshes will allow local towns and farms to expand, bringing civilization to a place that had lost it."
 MIT_minotaurian_mainland:0 "Asterion Reunited"
 MIT_minotaurian_mainland_desc:0 "After much time and effort the nation is once again whole. Recognition of this will pass not with the bang of celebration, but with the soft whimper of citizens sleeping soundly in their beds. They're finally back home, and nothing will ever change that."
 MIT_creeper_buildings:0 "Creeper Mountains Army Base"
 MIT_creeper_buildings_desc:0 "Since the Creeper Mountains are a natural defensive position it only makes sense for the military to purchase building rights there and establish a military base dedicated to arms production, utilizing local strategic resources."
 MIT_auropallieta_buildings:0 "Invest In Auropallieta"
 MIT_auropallieta_buildings_desc:0 "Due to the nearby border with Sicameon it only makes sense to invest in Auropallieta which can benefit from trade with our neighbour. Cyanolisia neglected the region for decades so they need all the help they can get to get back on their hooves."
 MIT_salmarkt_buildings:0 "Salmarkt Arms Production"
 MIT_salmarkt_buildings_desc:0 "As the crossroads of civilization it only makes sense for Salmarkt to have a military presence, especially considering its strategic location. Local economy will be redirected to supply the Asterionese army."

 # Militery
 MIT_escort_construction:0 "Purchase Civilian Shipyards"
 MIT_escort_construction_desc:0 "As the time for retaking the mainland grows ever closer we must enlarge military ship production to provide the escorts and fire support needed for a successful amphibious assault. Purchases of civilian shipyards will allow for the facilitation of this once the shipyards have been properly converted."

 MIT_expand_the_MCG_desc:0 "For decades the Asterion Coast Guard has been the sword arm of the nation's anti-piracy operations. The image of guardsbulls leading the charge into pirate ships to rescue slaves and clean up the sapient garbage of the sea is an enduring image in the culture of Asterion. Expanding the organization will no doubt help preparations for the upcoming reclamation."
 MIT_amphibious_operations:0 "ACG Expertise"
 MIT_amphibious_operations_desc:0 "The ACG is the oldest active arm of the Asterionese military, and they have undertaken many amphibious operations It only makes sense then to plumb the depths of their experience to ensure that the liberation of our separated mainland states goes smoothly."
 MIT_smokeless_powder:0 "Smokeless Powder"
 MIT_smokeless_powder_desc:0 "For many years now smokeless powder has been the standard propellent of almost every single firearms cartridge in civilian hands, but the standard infantry weapons of the military have yet to advance in the time since the Fall of The Empire and the succession wars that followed. It's time for the continuing resolution and deadlocked committees to end. The military needs modern firearms, and it needs them now."
 MIT_army_doctrine:0 "Update the Army Doctrine"
 MIT_army_doctrine_desc:0 "The time of the Restoration War is long past, but experts from that war are still among us. Using the expertise of the famous Elite Four the ground combat doctrines currently in use shall be revolutionized into a new way of fighting. The oppressors won't know what hit them."

Since the minotaurs that make up the majority of the troops don't have flight or magic manipulation mechanization will more than make up for any shortcomings."
 MIT_top_cover:0 "Top Cover"
 MIT_top_cover_desc:0 "With the Asterionese Air Force becoming more of a reality every day it's time for those valiant pilots to have homes to call their own. These new bases will greatly help us in the upcoming operation."
 MIT_paratroopers_focus:0 "Airborne Divisions"
 MIT_paratroopers_focus_desc:0 "The importation of a simple safety device for aircraft called a parachute has led our military planners to a startling conclusion. By giving these parachutes to soldiers and their equipment entire armies would be able to be inserted behind enemy lines to sow confusion. Should a sea landing become unviable these daring bulls of action will become invaluable."
 MIT_aircraft_supplies:0 "Synthetic Resources"
 MIT_aircraft_supplies_desc:0 "Whether they run on crystals, petroleum, or one of the more exotic power sources it is undeniable that aircraft require many resources to run that are just not found in sufficient numbers in Asterion. Therefore we must create our own supplies out of the resources we do have available."

 MIT_review_navy_budget_desc:0 "With the mainland states liberated the time has come to focus the two houses of the Voulí on the task of addressing the military budgets long held in limbo. First up shall be the navy budget. With it addressed Asterion's pride can once more control the seas and protect the trade without pirate interference."
 MIT_new_rnd:0 "Open New Research and Development Facility"
 MIT_new_rnd_desc:0 "The current facilities for research are stellar, but limited by space. By building a new wing onto the complex we shall allow for more technologies to be researched simultaneously. Consequently, the overall speed of research will increase."
 MIT_start_healing:0 "Bridge Internal Divides"
 MIT_start_healing_desc:0 "Now that the land is once more whole we must start to do the same for the people. For years the population has seen itself divided along every possible line. No more."
 MIT_economic_law:0 "Revise General Military Spending"
 MIT_economic_law_desc:0 "With the world becoming ever more dangerous it is time we dealt with the issue of military spending. By moving to a higher state of mobilization we will be able to make better use of our already existing concrete factories, along with several other benefits."
 MIT_open_immigration:0 "Open Immigration Offices"
 MIT_open_immigration_desc:0 "Now that Asterion is back on her feet we can finally feel safe opening up the immigration offices. They will have to shed their old cultures to become Asterionese, but we are so confident in our culture that we doubt that absorbing them will be any problem."
 MIT_building_slots1:0 "Continued Urbanisation"
 MIT_building_slots1_desc:0 "As the largest of the islands in the Asterion Archipelago, Kainourgio Spiti has a great amount of land usable for agriculture and mining, and as a result it has a relatively low urbanisation rate despite its large cities. By providing public jobs and building afforable housing, we can encourage further urban expansion."
 MIT_building_slots3:0 "Expand Military-Industrial Complex"
 MIT_building_slots3_desc:0 "We have already benefited greatly from our army's close ties to our defence industry. We shall approve increased military spending and sign additional contracts with arms companies, to further increase production of equipment."
 MIT_building_slots2:0 "Island Real Estate"
 MIT_building_slots2_desc:0 "There are many many small islands in the Asterion Archipelago, with many being grouped in larger states. By purchasing at least one plot of land in each of the states not on the mainland or Kainourgio Spiti we shall spread out our operations enough that hopefully a single attack won't slow us down during war."
 MIT_island_rnd:0 "LabCom"
 MIT_island_rnd_desc:0 "The many islands of the archipelago have equally as many schools, universities, and singular scientific laboratories. By setting up a system for these disconnected research centers to communicate and collaborate we shall greatly increase our capacity for research. Coincidently, there are a number of military testing grounds that shall be integrated into the system."
 MIT_building_slots4:0 "Archipelago Expansion"
 MIT_building_slots4_desc:0 "While the mainland states are still being restored to their former glory the states in the Home Islands are still ripe for military development. The plan for this expansion is simple: one state, one plot of land. This shall surely be a massive boon to our fighting capability once all plots are fully operational."
 MIT_foreign_legion:0 "Asterion Foreign Legion"
 MIT_foreign_legion_desc:0 "There are many people across the globe who long to be part of the Asterionese way of life. To service these poor downtrodden we should establish a military unit made up entirely of perspective citizens. Once proven to be ideologically pure they shall be able to join the military in Asterion, and take their families too. Service will guarantee citizenship for these hopefuls."
 MIT_main_rnd:0 "Kókkino Mountain Complex"
 MIT_main_rnd_desc:0 "Kókkino Mountain might not be the largest mountain in the state of Ketta, but its unique and recently classified structure allows it to have a very valuable purpose for our war efforts; the inside can be hollowed out and filled with a heavily armored research complex. This shall allow us conduct all manner of research in secret without destroying the countryside."
 MIT_expand_rubber_plantations:0 "Expand Rubber Plantations"
 MIT_expand_rubber_plantations_desc:0 "Rubber has long been the primary export of Asterion. This is partly due to Imperial investment in the plantations, which meant that most of the produce was confiscated in the name of the Emperor to supply their own economy. But now that we are free, the plantations belong to us and so do their profits. We should plant even more rubber trees and become the rubber capital of Griffonia."
 MIT_building_slots_continuous:0 "Repetitive Building Programs"
 MIT_building_slots_continuous_desc:0 "Government officials are apparently tired of the military always asking them for massive purchases of land to expand onto, so they've decided to authorize us to purchase land on our own. Should be fun once they get finished with the paperwork."

 MIT_political_effort:0 "Divided We Are Weak!"
 MIT_political_effort_desc:0 "The squabbling and disputes between the Unity party and the increasingly popular Fascio-Communist coalition must end! We are getting distracted from our main duty: Retaking our lost lands, liberating our race and safeguarding our freedom at any cost. If we keep arguing, unable to have a single, shared vision of the future, we will crumble and once again become slaves."

 MIT_coalition_victory:0 "Fascio-Communist Victory!"
 MIT_coalition_victory_desc:0 "Many said it couldn't be done, but the unified party of the fascists and the communists have finally secured an electoral majority. Asterion waits with bated breath for how this party made up of people who once swore that real change could only come through violent revolution will govern."
 MIT_creeper_mountains:0 "Negotiate For Creeper Mountains"
 MIT_creeper_mountains_desc:0 "During their misguided offensive to seize yet more of our beloved land the counter revolutionary forces on the mainland lost control of the Creeper Mountains. Now that the Imperialist oppressors have been disposed of it's time to secure the northernmost state. We shall open negotiations with whoever controls it now, and show the world how peace loving we are by returning the land without firing a shot. If they do not accept then we shall still show the world our resolve."
 MIT_collective_construction:0 "Collective Construction"
 MIT_collective_construction_desc:0 "To allow for the construction of the immense bulwark that will keep the collective masses of Asterion safe sacrifices will have to be made. Individuality is great in times of peace, but this is a crisis with war but a hair's breadth away. Civilians will be organized into construction crews under the military's command to accomplish this great project."
 MIT_antiaircraft_artillery:0 "Collective Air Defense Net"
 MIT_antiaircraft_artillery_desc:0 "But what about the possibility of an air attack? When the anti-minotaur conspirators come we will have an answer for that question."
 MIT_land_fort:0 "Fortification Collectives"
 MIT_land_fort_desc:0 "Castles, watchtowers, walls, trenches, and all other manner of fortification. We shall build them all. The filthy featherbrains shall fall before them like freshly slaughtered panthers."
 MIT_defensive_spirit:0 "Asterion Triumphant"
 MIT_defensive_spirit_desc:0 "We are invincible! Now that our defenses are complete, no-one can hurt us. It's time for that spirit to invest the public consciousness, and for every minotaur to fight ten times as hard."
 MIT_artificial_magic:0 "Synthetic Crystals"
 MIT_artificial_magic_desc:0 "Magic crystals can store a great amount of power in them. It is becoming increasingly clear to us that they can be used for all kinds of purposes. However, our domestic supply is lacking, so we must experiment with "growing" artificial crystals and see if they are as good as the natural ones."
 MIT_new_techniques:0 "New Techniques"
 MIT_new_techniques_desc:0 "Over the course of our scramble for resources we have learned new ways of extracting valuable substances, and it's time to put those techniques into practice."
 MIT_party_loyalty:0 "One Party, One Loyalty"
 MIT_party_loyalty_desc:0 "We have gone through many trials, and after so long it can firmly be said that we are no longer a divided party. The old petty conflicts of Communism versus Fascism have fallen away thanks to the Dear Leader's efforts. We are of one mind, one vision, one purpose."

 MIT_democratic_victory:0 "Unity Party Victorious!"
 MIT_democratic_victory_desc:0 "After a contentious political season and a long debate the Unity Party has emerged victorious! Ilias Adar has become the new president, and promises to lead Asterion outwards for liberty and republicanism. Few outside might notice the difference, but something big has indeed happened."
 MIT_democratic_alliance:0 "Formalize the CSN"
 MIT_democratic_alliance_desc:0 "In recent years there has been a movement to formalize our alliance with our democratic amigos in Sicameon to allow for military and logistic cooperation. In a world filled with monarchs, dictators, and evil wizards, it is argued, the free peoples of the world need to band together for defense against those who would see them as slaves. The Coalition of Sovereign Nations will evolve to become that band, and together we happy few shall make the world safe for liberty."

 MIT_oni_desc:0 "With the world becoming ever more dangerous we are faced with an uncomfortable truth which we can deny no longer - we are small. To counteract our nation's inherent small size in both bullpower and territory we shall establish an intelligence agency to affect change in foreign countries. Basil Zacharias shall be the first head of this agency."
 MIT_expeditionary_forces:0 "Asterionese Ground and Air Expeditionary Force"
 MIT_expeditionary_forces_desc:0 "With more under the table methods of liberation now firmly established it's time we deployed our forces in a more public manner. The AGAEF will allow our generals and the armies under them to publically volunteer to fight in foreign wars, surely allowing for a greater morale boost among the oppressed people of the world."
 MIT_remote_nation_building:0 "Remote Nation Building"
 MIT_remote_nation_building_desc:0 "By making friends we gain two victories; gaining an ally against The Empire, and stopping the Imperials from gaining an ally. When those friends are strong it's even better. It's time we went about building up our allies, and the enemies of The Empire."

 MIT_SIC_assistance:0 "Coalition Research Directorate"
 MIT_SIC_assistance_desc:0 "Now that the CSN has been solidified as a military alliance it behooves us to be on equal footing with our allies. Setting up the CoRD will allow us and our beloved friends to fight side by side without the issues that come with disparate technology levels."
 MIT_trade_federation_friendship:0 "Trade Federation Friendship"
 MIT_trade_federation_friendship_desc:0 "The Skyfall Trade Federation has long been a bastion of democracy, commerce, and naval prowess, much like us. It only makes sense then to approach them about joining the Coalition of Sovereign Nations. If they decide to decline, as they are most likely to do, then we can at least establish good trading relations and lay the groundwork for future anti-piracy endeavours."
 MIT_town_friendship:0 "Operation Outstretched Hand"
 MIT_town_friendship_desc:0 "The FToG has been an ally of Asterion in the past, with sailors from both nations cooperating with each other. It appears that some things have changed, however, and so it would be best to send a formal inquiry. If they still stand by democracy, then they should be invited to the CSN. If they have fallen to monarchy or anarchy, then we shall intervene."
 MIT_command_council:0 "Coalition Command Council"
 MIT_command_council_desc:0 "As forces from different nations in the CSN continue to fight alongside each other the need for a unified command at the strategic level becomes more clear. By setting up a council of war we can prevent further incidents like what happened with our sailors and the Sicameonese marines back in '02. We're still playing back that family for what happened to their penguins."
 MIT_coalition_trade:0 "Coalition Free Trade Agreement"
 MIT_coalition_trade_desc:0 "If we trust each other enough to die for each other we should trust each other enough to buy each other's stuff. Doing this with minor supplies will free up that much more production capacity for construction projects."
 MIT_coalition_immigration:0 "Coalition Work Visa"
 MIT_coalition_immigration_desc:0 "As the need for military contractors to travel through different nations to do their jobs increases the paperwork involved also increases. By issuing a visa that is accepted by all CSN member states to those individuals deemed worthy of the privilege of free movement we can greatly reduce overhead costs. As a side effect, member states might see slight increases in their working populations."
 MIT_coalition_exchange_students:0 "CSN Cadet Exchange Program"
 MIT_coalition_exchange_students_desc:0 "Each of the militaries of the Coalition brings something unique and interesting to the table, not only in terms of material but also in terms of tradition and tactics. Allowing our cadets the chance to spend a semester in a foreign school will those give them different perspectives that will make them better officers."
 MIT_pirate_hunting:0 "Operation Keelhaul"
 MIT_pirate_hunting_desc:0 "The zebra and deer colonies on the continent have long resorted to piracy and other horrible crimes to get what they want. Now they are threatening our trade with Grenclyf. No more! We must mobilize the CSN to finally wipe this threat from the face of the planet."

 MIT_BAN_border_war:0 "Operation Final Liberation"
 MIT_BAN_border_war_desc:0 "It’s time to take back the Creeper Mountains, one way or the other.

This is it, after all this time our nation will be one once again."

 MIT_divided_society_desc:0 "The parliament -- and indeed the entire society -- of Asterion is now divided between two rival factions, the harmonist Unity party and the pragmatic coalition of fascist Old Guard party and communist Red Purity party. Both sides have very different ideas on policies and foreign affairs and can only agree on two things: The mainland must be reclaimed and foreign monarchists must be kept at bay."

 MIT_militaryindustrialcomplex_desc:0 "The military of Asterion has allied itself with the defence industry, to ensure it remains well supplied for war. It is a mutually beneficial relationship where the army receives equipment and the companies receive payment in return. However, as a result military spending is high and the civilian sector is neglected."

Every citizen has vowed to never again allow their nation be subjugated by foreigners, no matter the cost. Eléftheron tó Éfpsychon!"

 MIT_MAXIMIN_DESC:0 "Maximin was born in Cyanolisia in 973 to a family of serfs on a griffon-owned tobacco farm. In 982 his family fled to Asterion after the nation won its freedom in the Restoration War and lived there in poverty until Maximin accepted an offer to travel to Stalliongrad in 999, to study at the Steel Stallion International School of Communism. He returned to Asterion years later and was one of the founding members of the Kókkini Katharótita, quickly becoming its General Secretary."

 MIT_MAXIRY_DESC:0 "For years after the Restoration War, the liberal Enótita party dominated the political scene of Asterion, but now a new rival has entered the stage and taken their place in the spotlight. It is an unlikely and purely pragmatic coalition of the fascist Paliá Frourá and communist Kókkini Katharótita parties, for the leaders of the two, Andris Dóry and Maximin Kókkinos, knew they could only challenge the Enótita party by allying with each other. Now that they are in power however, many doubt the coalition will last long."
 MIT_DORY_DESC:0 "Born in Lóthar, Aetiea in 941, Andris joined the Asterionese Military Academy at an early age and joined the Imperial Army's auxiliary forces. During the collapse of the Empire he defected, returned to his homeland and became a leading general in the Restoration War, fighting bravely against the occupying forces. After the victory he became the Minister of Military Affairs. During the government of Konstantinos Kondylis, he was exiled to Wingbardy due to his Imperial connections. There he met with Beakolini and came to respect the griffon and his ideas of military governance. On his return to Asterion after Konstantinos Kondylis’ death he founded the Fasístas Paliá Frourá, a party composed primarily of veterans of the Restoration War and nationalists."
