### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_Ceyda_desc:0 "During her coronation ceremony on the eleventh month of 1006, few expected that Ceyda Vatosoa, sole daughter of the late Mpanjaka Serkan Vatosoa, would have the austere, iron-fisted attitude nor the administrative expertise needed to rule the turbulent nation of Sambovato that her father possessed, at least not at such a young age. However, what the new Mpanjakavavy does not lack is the wits of a learner, the resolve of a leader and most importantly the charisma befitting of her stunning beauty as the \"Ebony Pearl of Sambovato\".\n\nBorn on a stormy summer night in 988, Ceyda was surrounded by nothing but the vast opulence of the Vatosoa clan as early as she could remember, as a true silver spoon filly. However, the devastating death of her mother shortly after her birth in circumstances still mysterious to this day left her without siblings and the sole heir of the fledgling Vatosoa dynasty, a reality her father Serkan remedied to by keeping her daughter far removed from the politics, machinations and intrigue of the Rova's court culture for the preservation of her relative safety and innocence. Thus Ceyda grew up to be a cultured and beautiful, if rather eccentric young socialite mare, unwittingly becoming the popular public face of the monarchy through her lavish parties and grand public festivities, relaxing with her best friend by the pool of her family rova or watching the movements of the mighty National Protection Fleet from her seaside balcony in between occasions, all while being counseled by the best tutors money could afford. However, with the Mpanjaka's abrupt and premature death in late 1006, the barely mature Ceyda was called upon by her late father's advisory council to assume the throne of Sambovato as the second monarch of the Vatosoa dynasty.\n\nAs the young queen prepares to enter the chambers of the National Rova for the very first time of her life to confront and read the faces of these supposedly altruistic and well-meaning ministers and set the course of her country's increasingly uncertain future, she thinks to herself...\n\n\"Inexperience be damned, aren't politics after all just another party to navigate?\""

### General & Admiral Descriptions ###
 MQA_rano_desc:0 "§YBorn§!:  May 27, 951 in Tsenalakana\n\n§YRank§!: Amiraly Lehibe\n\n§YBiography§!: Having come into the world facing the sea on the lively shores of the city of a hundred markets and a thousand boats, the eventual ascension of Yüce Ranomasina to the rank of Grand Admiral and consequently that of Commander of the National Protection Navy of Sambovato, a title whose power and influence is claimed to only be topped by that of Mpanjaka itself, was manifestly assured from his dawn, for he had the celestial destiny of being born into the noble Ranomasina clan, a family of accomplished mariners whose great princely Maroseranana ancestors once ruled the southern stretches of the island and its many ports before kowtowing first to the great Mpanjaka of Sambovato, then their Senturyan suzerains as their most loyal servants on the deep blue waves for centuries thereafter.\n\nAnd thus, just like his father and grandfather before him, Yüce enrolled into the then Senturyan Navy at a young age, experiencing a meteoric rise to the rank of second officer by the age of 25 before the Great Mutiny gradually consumed his home around him. It is said within the court whispers that on the night of his promotion ceremony to first officer, the young commander burst out of his cabin a completely different zebra, suddenly rallying his ship’s crew before mutinying and sending their centaur superiors overboard into the sea before declaring his zealous allegiance not to the traditional Mpanjaka, enfeebled and sidelined by centuries of humiliating submission over in the royal highlands, but to the new, young and vigorous Mpanjaka over in Akorandriakarova, one hailing from his beloved coast and sea where his people truly belonged, Serkan Vatosoa.\n\nHis fervent loyalty to the new dynasty was handsomely rewarded after the success of the Great Mutiny and the affirmation of independence from the Kingdom of Senturya, being entrusted first the full command of the newly acquired Senturyan fleet present in Sambovato as its first Grand Admiral, then that of the Committee of National Protection tasked with overseeing the nation’s military upkeep and modernization before the Mpanjaka’s untimely death in late 1006. The  middle-aged admiral now stands tall as a pagoda mast as one of the court’s most powerful advisors, with critics and supporters alike noting his particular uncle-like fondness for Serkan’s daughter Ceyda as well as his strong belief in the rebirth of Sambovato’s glorious thalassocratic past.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Ryan"
