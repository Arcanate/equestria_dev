 POLITICS_Ceyda_desc:0 "During her coronation ceremony on the eleventh month of 1006, few expected that Ceyda Vatosoa, sole daughter of the late Mpanjaka Serkan Vatasoa, would have the austere, iron-fisted attitude nor the administrative expertise needed to rule the turbulent nation of Qazikara that her father possessed, at least not at such a young age. However, what the new Mpanjakavavy does not lack is the wits of a learner, the resolve of a leader and most importantly the charisma befitting of her stunning beauty as the \"Ebony Pearl of Qazikara\".\n\nBorn on a stormy summer night in 988, Ceyda was surrounded by nothing but the vast opulence of the Vatasoa clan as early as she could remember, a true silver spoon filly. However, the devastating death of her mother shortly after her birth in circumstances still mysterious to this day left her without siblings and the sole heir of the fledgling Vatosoa dynasty, a reality her father Serkan remedied to by keeping her daughter far removed from the politics, machinations and intrigue of the Rova's court culture for the preservation of her relative safety and innocence. Thus Ceyda grew up to be a cultured and beautiful, if rather eccentric young socialite mare, unwittingly becoming the popular public face of the monarchy through her lavish parties and grand public festivities, relaxing with her best friend by the pool of her family rova or watching the movements of the mighty National Protection Fleet from her seaside balcony in between occasions, all while being counseled by the best tutors money could afford. However, with the Mpanjaka's abrupt and premature death in late 1006, the barely mature Ceyda was called upon by her late father's advisory council to assume the throne of Qazikara as the second monarch of the Vatosoa dynasty.\n\nAs the young queen prepares to enter the chambers of the National Rova for the very first time of her life to confront and read the faces of these supposedly altruistic and well-meaning ministers and set the course of her country's increasingly uncertain future, she thinks to herself...\n\n\"Inexperience be damned, aren't politics after all just another party to navigate?\""
