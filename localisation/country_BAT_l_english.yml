BAT_examine_military_procedures:0 "Examine What Went Wrong"
BAT_examine_military_procedures_desc:0 "We have failed to bring the Eternal Night and Nightmare Moon remains lost to us, but we cannot give up hope! We must think back to our ancestors when they first arrived on these shores, we must follow in their example and lay the groundwork for the next war. Even if it must be in another thousand years."
BAT_new_officers_from_equestria:0 "Welcome the New Exiles"
BAT_new_officers_from_equestria_desc:0 "With the failure of Operation Moonshine, we must arrange for a withdrawl of significant assets from Equestria. There is a silver lining in that the officers we embedded into the Equestrian military can now return to us with their experiences and sympatherizers."
BAT_support_squads:0 "Auxiliary Combat Role Training"
BAT_support_squads_desc:0 "Our Auxiliaries cannot be wasted on menial tasks anymore! Some of our most loyal units comprise of Auxiliary forces, therefore we must integrate them wholly into the Legions. Seperate support companies mixed in with regular troops will give our frontline units greater flexibility."
BAT_moonspeakers_in_military_roles:0 "Adapt the Luna Nova"
BAT_moonspeakers_in_military_roles_desc:0 ""
BAT_ranger_corps:0 "Her Imperial Majesty's Legionary Ranger Corps"
BAT_ranger_corps_desc:0 "We must develop a dedicated light infantry corps to better improve the lethality of our divisions. It is with this course of action that we open our first 'Ranger' school in the Howling Hills region. We shall test candidates mental, physical, and martial prowess in order to form a specialized ranger corps that can be integrated with our main infantry units.
BAT_equipment_modernisation:0 "Equipment Modernisation"
BAT_equipment_modernisation_desc:0 "The world around us is rapidly evolving with major technological advancements made in a matter of months rather than years. We cannot afford to fall behind. It is too costly and time consuming to consistently rely on espionage to acquire new equipment for us to copy, so we must subsidize our own researchers to improve upon our own equipment."
BAT_legacy_of_the_shadowbolts:0 "Legacy of the Shadowbolts"
BAT_legacy_of_the_shadowbolts_desc:0 "The Shadowbolts were a dedicated flying formation from the first coming of Nightmare moon known for their ferocity in the skies! Their night flying is legendary and their accomplishments in the skies even greater! We shall look to their memory as we develop our flying corps capabilities, our new planes and doctrine will echo their legacy!"
BAT_troop_support:0 "Combined Arms Tactics"
BAT_troop_support_desc:0 "The use of combined arms represents the future of warfare. Coordinated assaults of infantry, artillery, and armor to destroy the enemy in quick, decisive attacks will win us our next war. Gone are the days of wasteful tactics and mass infantry attacks without proper support, this new doctrine will pave the way to victory with overwhelming firepower."
BAT_new_bombercraft:0 "Strategic Destruction"
BAT_new_bombercraft_desc:0 "In war we are not just fighting military forces anymore, we are fighting nations. Every city is an asset, every civilian in it a labourer for their war effort. Some on the Council might not approve of this new approach to warfare, but we must strike at all assets of the enemy in order to end a war as quickly as possible by bombing the enemy into absolute submission."
BAT_the_fuel_issue:0 "The Imperial Strategic Petroleum Reserve"
BAT_the_fuel_issue_desc:0 "We are a small nation and our resources can easily be stretched thin in a prolonged conflict, why even our economy now is relient upon fuel. Our limited contact with the world at large means that we cannot so easily acquire it either. By opening a series of synthetic plants and establishing a means to store vast quantities of oil for long periods of time, we can prepare a vast reserve for military use."
BAT_army_motorisation:0 "Legionary Motorisation"
BAT_army_motorisation_desc:0 "There is a tribe of warriors on Zebrica that can march fifty miles a day and still fight, but they are only carrying spears and shields. A modern soldier carries much more and his support unit's wagons. We must fully motorize our military so that we can move a hundred fifty miles a day and fight with the full force of our modern Legions!"
BAT_army_development:0 "The Military Industrial Complex"
BAT_army_development_desc:0 "The industry required to sustain our massive military build-up can only be met by government subsidies into industry itself. To keep our military top of the line, we embrace this unique balance between industry, research, and government against the critics who warn of tying our commercial assets even deeper with out military forces. With this change, we will be able to research more and choose which projects best suit our force."
BAT_armoured_trains:0 "Armoured Trains"
BAT_armoured_trains_desc:0 "Railways are the backbone of our logistics no matter the amount of trucks we may have. It is important that we provide this critical asset of military infastructure with the means to defend itself. By implementing the use of armored trains, we cannot only improve the defense of our logistics but also some units dedicated to protecting railways to be used elsewhere."
BAT_extensive_planning:0 "Strategy in Depth"
BAT_extensive_planning_desc:0 "Tactics are the plans at the smallest unit level and srategy is at the highest, but their overall goals must align for success. Our strategic mission in any military campaign or operation must be clear so that commanders on all levels understand its intent."
BAT_military_logistics_department:0 "Legionary Logistics Corp"
BAT_military_logistics_department_desc:0 "An army marches on its stomach, or so the saying goes. With the adoption of vehicles, modern weapons, and other tools of warefare; an army marches on its stomach and fights with whatever the motorpool can provide. Our improved Logistics Corps shall ensure that our army has whatever it needs wherever it needs it."
BAT_joint_chiefs_of_staff:0 "Joint Chiefs of Staff"
BAT_joint_chiefs_of_staff_desc:0 "Only a fool would have different branches of our military compete with one another for supplies or resources, but we are limited in who we can provide with what. By adopting a Joint Chiefs of Staff to inform the Legionary Council of the different branches' needs, we can better organize and coordinate their efforts with the goal of the state."
BAT_psychological_warfare:0 "Psychological Warfare"
BAT_psychological_warfare_desc:0 "All soldiers are susceptible to manipulation, even our own. While our propaganda will remind the Legions what they are fighting for, we shall invest heavily into our own efforts to undermine our enemy's will to fight. It is useless to resist the will of Nightmare Moon and we are her chosen ponies. If the pamphlets do not convince them, the speaker systems will."
BAT_chemical_warfare_corps:0 "The LMRD Chemical Department"
BAT_chemical_warfare_corps_desc:0 "A detachment of LMRD scientists will oversee the training of the first and all future members of the Legion's Chemical Corps. These soldiers will be specialized in utilizing advances in 'tactical use' chemicals such as gas, white phosphorus, and herbicides across all branches of our military while also acting to counter any use of chemical weapons by our enemy."
BAT_blow_them_out:0 "Destruction From Afar"
BAT_blow_them_out_desc:0 "Every life of a Legionnaire is sacred in the eyes of our great goddess. We cannot afford to spend them in her honor with wasteful assaults or risky maneuver tactics taken from heretical bugs. We instead will embrace a doctrine over overwhelming and superior firepower. It is our hope that once our artillery is done with a position that the infantry will simply have to sweep the enemy out of the crater."
BAT_legionary_operational_integrity:0 "Operational Integrity"
BAT_legionary_operational_integrity_desc:0 "Gone are the days when generals commanded nearly every aspect of a battle. Instead, our commanders will now pass on their plans and intent to subordinates. Those subordinates will do the same down the chain of command. At each level the officers will be able to pursue their own means to completing their respective objectives with disciplined intiative."
BAT_artillery_reliability:0 "Concentrated Fire"
BAT_artillery_reliability_desc:0 "The harder the fighting and the longer the war, the more the Legions leans on its gunners. Our artillery is the King of battle fit for our Holy Empress. We must ensure that the tools of our gunners are reliable as they are on the field of battle. Our Moonspeakers shall bless their shells and our ordnance shall rain the Nightmare's righteous fury from them."
BAT_mobile_warfare_conception:0 "The Batton Plan" #Yes I too want to die for this pun
BAT_mobile_warfare_conception_desc:0 "General Batton's insistence on a flexible, mobile army has lead to his personal development of a new doctrine for the Legions. Hoofcrafted, the 'Batton Plan' copies much from the Changeling school of warefare, but makes modifications that focus on the sustainability of maneuver warfare. If we were to fully commit to this plan, Batton insists our force could be entirely motorized in a matter of years."
BAT_develop_tank_models:0 "Adapt Stalliongradian Blueprints"
BAT_develop_tank_models_desc:0 "The godless heathens in Stalliongrad do not make the best tanks, but they are easy to manufacture and replace. They are also receptive to bribes and are more then willing to lose a few...examples. By adopting the Stalliongrad designs and doctrine, we will gain from the benefit their tanks offer; ease of manufacturing, utility, and numerical superiority."
BAT_develop_anti_tank:0 "The Stanchion"
BAT_develop_anti_tank_desc:0 "The Stanchion is a modern anti-tank rifle that gives its user the power of an anti-tank gun in the power of their hooves. Early trials are promising with live fire demonstrations coming in a matter of months. The ammunition the tank weapon uses can be altered as well depending on the range, target, or enviornment; all around a promising and unique weapon for our Legions' arsenals."
BAT_replacable_parts:0 "Material Standardisation"
BAT_replacable_parts_desc:0 "We adopted Stalliongradian tanks because of their easily replaceable parts, why not extend this idea to all of our military? By ensuring that reliability and ease of repair is uniform for all our materials, it will become easier to mantain our Legion's lethality during protracted conflicts."
BAT_heavier_tanks:0 "Breakthrough Tactics"
BAT_heavier_tanks_desc:0 "Our lighter tanks exceed our expectations with maneuverability, but they do not meet our needs to overcome deeply entrenched enemy positions. Sometimes one cannot simply drive around the enemy, therefore we must invest in developing a heavier model of tank that can drive through the enemy."
BAT_the_power_of_massed_assaults:0 "All the Little Ponies"
BAT_the_power_of_massed_assaults_desc:0 "The average machine gun fires hundreds of rounds per minute, but every enemy machine gun has a finite amount of ammo and a limited field of fire. With the blessings of the Nightmare, we cannot fail in overcoming this mortal obstacle. If it fires hundreds of rounds, we shall send thousands of ponies! We will crash upon our enemy like a wave in concentrated assaults!"
BAT_modern_assault_tactics:0 "Stormtrooper Tactics"
BAT_modern_assault_tactics_desc:0 "Those heretical Eyr worshippers on Griffonia and their meagre empire have developed an interesting infantry doctrine around 'Infiltration Tactics' and 'Stormtroopers'. By allowing small detatchments of our soldiers to survey and attack weakpoints in the enemy line, we can breakthrough where the enemy least expects us; just like the Stormtroopers of the Griffon Empire."
BAT_redemptionary_brigades:0 "Redemptionary Brigades"
BAT_redemptionary_brigades_desc:0 "Deserters, traitors, labourers, and any other dissidents who are willing to repent their sins shall be given the chance to find redemption through service in these special brigades. It might be cruel, but it is far more efficient to use them as a moving, fighting shield for our other units rather than simply execute them for their crimes."
BAT_combat_enhancers:0 "The LMRD Alchemical Department"
BAT_combat_enhancers_desc:0 "Methamphetamine hydrochloride when mixed with shamanistic poitions creates a potent combat enhancement that keeps soldiers alert without the risk of a crash after. We shall encourage our soldiers to consume these enhancements and monitor their effects. These enhancements will be distributed to units in laced gum, chocolates, and tablets for consumption."
BAT_steal_the_bits_gun:0 "The Bits Gun"
BAT_steal_the_bits_gun_desc:0 "Although the Bits gun might look strange and according to reports nearly impossible to carry comfortably, our wayward enemies in Equestria have created a reliable weapon suited for all types of environments. An internal compartment inside the reciever prevents the submachine gun from jamming even after dipped in mud or sand. Even its odd placement of the magazine holds a pragmatic purpose; we must have it for ourselves."
BAT_imperial_engineer_corps:0 "Her Imperial Majesty's Sappers"
BAT_imperial_engineer_corps_desc:0 "With the integration of Auxiliary units into combat roles, we can train our engineers to serve a greater purpose in combat. Taken from the Aquileian tradition, our sappers will act as our frontline combat engineers. No matter the danger, the obstacle, or the mission; our sappers will clear a path for our Empress' blessed Legions!"

And on that night of nights, 1,000 years after the Great Catastrophe…\n\nThe Elements of Harmony tore her asunder.\n\nThe accursed charms ripped divinity from her holy hooves and devolved her to a lesser form. She had returned though, Nightmare Moon had returned! Her mortal form may be weakened in Princess Luna, but it was a sign! Despite her weakened state, Chiropterra rejoiced for months at her rebirth; there was hope.\n\nFor seven years we have intensified our efforts and expanded our operations on Equus. We have strained already soured relations between Thestrals and Ponies, sabotaged efforts to modernize the Equestrian military even after the Changeling heretics captured Canterlot, and have embedded our assets across the Equestrian territories.\n\nOur ancestors arrived on Zebrica with spears and bows on rickety triremes bursting from the seam with their families. Our exile here, our removal from our homeland will be avenged! We will return to Equestria in massive ships armed with tanks and machine guns, each blessed by the moon herself!\n\nAnd if we fail? We shall wait a millennia more. We are patient, we are watching, and we will return!"

bat.9.t:0 "Report #3112"
bat.9.d:0 "Eternal Eclipse frowned as he used an old abacus to crunch the numbers on the relocation of Labourer Subclass A-951 to Labourer Subclass A-956. The stallion did not struggle with the math, numbers were his strong suit. His old abacus just did not go high enough to account for the influx of new labourers enlightened in the last raid. Eternal was also not willing to use the new ‘slide ruler’ his grandson Lucent got him for his birthday.\n\n Allocating the labourers to their new professions based upon their old ones was hardly a trifling task either, but his equipment was slowing him down. It was rather ironic considering the stallion’s age. His mind was sharp as ever, but his body had slowed to a crawl. The ‘equipment’ he used to secure his spot on the Legion Council had worn thin.\n\n Even armed with a new tool, Eclipse wondered if it would even be enough.He never denied his feebleness now, the matters of the military were best left to younger soldiers like Lucent after all.\n\n He was just letting his frustration get the best of him, he would try to learn the slide ruler once Lucent came to visit for their afternoon tea. Eternal consoled himself that he was still useful as he reassigned two thousand, nine hundred, and thirty-three new labourers to their assignments across the munitions plants. Their children would be turned over to the academies for training.\n\n He hoped that Lucen would bring the mint tea, it always seemed to calm his nerves."

bat.10.d:0 "Kinta Kunte never paid no mind to his mother’s words to not sail too far to the east, the young zebra always found them to be nagging. It was a hag’s tale among the fisherfolk of their village, the lost remnants of an army kidnapping any they could get their hooves on. With the Storm King gone there was no reason not to expand to new spots!\n\n Kinta wished he had listened to her.\n\n  Their ship had drifted too far while they were trawling for krill, he had been below when the raid happened. A dozen pegasi and thestrals landed on their deck, killed the captain, and rounded them all up in a matter of minutes. A unicorn was brought down and cast a strange spell, forcing them into a deep sleep.\n\n  When Kinta woke up, he found himself in the Labourer’s quarters with the other captives. Some were killed trying to escape in the first week, another died from wounds after her flogging for interrupting a sermon to Nightmare Moon, and the last threw himself from the scaffolding down in the mines. Kinta was the last one from his ship after the first month. \n\n  And he has been there ever since, working all day and into the night. They do not let him near any boats, his thestral overlords know that Kinta would try to run just as his companions had. As the thestral captain who gave him his new name said; ‘You will mine, your children will fish, and their children will be citizens.’"

bat.11.d:0 "Autumn Breeze smiled as he nipped on the edge of a cigar, the tobacco paired well it the champagne he had taken on his last visit to Prance. Before ascending to the Legion Council, Breeze was quite proud to be something of an aficionado of Equestrian vineyards. While undercover a few of his more charged reviews even made it into national papers for a great deal of praise, of course his handlers quickly put a stop to that growing fame.\n\n “It was a danger to the mission after all,  just like you,” he mused as he let the smoke roll from his nostrils before he turned to face his acquaintance for the night. The Equestrian agent was bound to a chair, bloodied and broken a dozen times over through their previous festivities. Whatever nonsense he tried to gargle past his broken teeth came out as incomprehensible slurs.\n\n “Save your strength, I am just enjoying a break myself,” Autumn chuckled out as he took a small sip from his wine. “I do want to congratulate you, my friend. In nearly thirty years of operations I’ve been involved with, I’ve never seen somepony come so very close to actually proving we exist.”\n\n The agent choked out another gargle of bile and thrashed again his restraints, glaring past the one eye he had left.\n\n “I will take that as your modest appreciation for my kind words, but in any case,” Autumn added as he finished off his glass. “If you’re going to have to disappear, we’re going to have a bit more fun first; just me and you.”\n\n The thestral slowly sauntered towards the record player, choosing a more modern Octavian piece as he took the burning ember of the cigar with his hoofs. As the mare on the recording strum her cello to life, Breeze recounted how much he enjoyed his work as he resumed his interrogation.\n\n The agent gave him what he wanted, eventually."

bat.12.d:0 "Bright Opal never found himself to be particularly suited with most mares, a doctorate in physics and psychology usually ended with him trying to dissect his date’s minds more than actually caring about their interests.\n\n Those tendencies did not make him popular, but then he met Mystic Belle.\n\n She was quickly becoming everything to him. Ponies were hard to understand, prone to fits of emotion and irrational thought; even his own family was strained to care when he went on tirades about the numbers and mystical elements of crystals being harnessed for power..\n\n It was in one of these impromptu speeches that Mystic first approached him, for the first time his grandstanding at a bar among his colleagues had a desirable outcome. She was perfect; she let him pick away at her mind, she picked away at his, and her love of physics was only rivaled by her attachment to him.\n\n It was so easy with her, just like with math; being with her just added up.\n\n The only downside was how much the mare traveled, but Bright could not bear to hold that against her. That was her job after all, even if it meant a visit to Zebrica every few months to ensure the relief organization she ran in Warzena was going well.\n\n Mystic Belle was caring like that and Opal loved her all the more for it."

bat.13.d:0 "“Listen up!” Lightning Charm barked out as she trotted out before the Firstborn Legion, the feeling of over a thousand eyes bore in on her as she flipped a Stalliongrad rifle around in her hooves.\n\n “In light of some confusion among the rank and file, I have been asked by the Council to resolve these matters...I have elected to do so personally, so that each Legionnaire understands the new weapon system,” Lightning Charm hissed out to the soldiers. “This is the Stalliongrad SVETA rifle, it is a semi-automatic rifle and fires a 7.62mm cartridge accurately up to 500 meteres!”\n\n “Let me be clear! This is a weapon designed by a bunch, deranged godless heathens that Celestia let leave Equestria! They are exiles too and enemies of Equestria; but they have developed a weapon that surpasses our own!” the commander exclaimed as she swung the weapon around, ensuring everypony got a good look at it.\n\n “We are behind the curve, Legionnaires, and I am tired of hearing complaints from your commanders about there being a...reluctance among the ranks to adapt to the new weapons. Our breechloaders are not top of the line anymore, just like your father’s muskets, and like their grandfather’s swords!”\n\n “This rifle-” Lightning barked out as she held the SVETA above our head “-will be repurposed and learned, we will make it our own in time! But if I get any more reports about a legion dragging their heels in adapting to these new arms, I’m going to use them for target practice!”\n\n “Hold your officers accountable, hold yourselves accountable, and get it done!” she barked out as she slammed the butt of the rifle onto the stage. “Dismissed!”"

bat.14.t:0 "In The Embrace Of The Moon"
bat.14.d:0 "Gwedi always loved the Lunar Festival, it was the time when the Auxiliary divisions and the Legionnaire forces engaged in war games against each other to settle rivalries and praise the eternal goddess with copious amounts of booze and extra rations to celebrate. Most of the time the Legionnaire units trounced the Auxiliaries, but Gwedi led his engineers to three consecutive victories this year.\n\n Not that there was any real bad blood between the Auxiliaries and the Legions, all of that had been thawed out centuries ago. Legion might get the better equipment and the most dangerous missions, but there was no denying that the Auxiliaries had the most faith; and if Gwedi knew anything is that it was faith that got folks through the hard times.\n\n Gwedi’s mother had been a labourer, but when she converted and gave birth to him; Gwedi himself became qualified for the Auxiliary. When he was old enough he sprung at the opportunity without hesitation; better rations for his mother and a chance to secure his children citizenship under the benevolent night? What more could a Zebra ask for?\n\n The best part though of the Lunar Festival was the sermons. Gwedi never found himself proper in the temples for the goddess, but the sermons during the Festival were always around a dozen casks of the richest liquor they could find.\n\n When Lunar Hail stepped up onto an empty cask, Gwedi raised a healthy glass with every other soldier of Chiropterra following suit. The thestral priestess spoke with a fire and fury that would make even the most grizzled legionnaire blush. She promised an eternity in the night’s embrace for those that died righteously in battle, a divine heaven with enough warm beds and partners for every soul that fell in her service. Gwedi and all the auxiliaries hung on her words, in the thin moonlight and haze of the drink; Lunar Hail almost looked like Nightmare Moon herself!"

bat.19.d:0 "The Legionary Council has assembled to assess the military’s role in the failure of Operation Moonshine. No pony is looking forward to the discussion of why the nearly thousand year old plan failed, but to avoid a conflict with no solutions; four proposals to reform the military are being presented.\n\n The first proposal is from Lord Commander Palisade and Major General Air does not see any major changes to the doctrine, but rather the introduction of new technologies into the force. Their argument is that the planning for Moonshine was not flawed, just its execution. Therefore, the solution is to keep our modus operandi  in long term planning for advanced operations and simply improve upon our means of executing plans at a more effective rate.\n\n The next proposal is from Lady Commander Lightning Charm and Lieutenant General Brine. They propose an extreme change to the use of support units and artillery in our doctrine, favoring overwhelming firepower and the full integration of Auxiliary units to support it. Their solution to most military problems is to engage the enemy with such great quantities of firepower that our foes cannot retaliate.\n\n Lieutenant General Batton and Brigadier General Eclipse present the third and most radical plan to the council. Their heated debates are famous, but their vocal and passionate commitment to a doctrine that focuses on mobility is widely seen as the only thing they agree on. They believe that by motorizing our Legions and making the focus of our advance on armored units, that we can outmaneuver our adversaries and achieve decisive victories. \n\n Lady Commander Lunar Hail is well known for her piety in the holy Empress and advocates for a doctrine that she claims favors the goddess. By amassing large waves of soldiers for coordinated assaults, she believes that we can overcome any obstacle. Some counter that these plans would waste valuable Legionnaires, but she proposes supplementing the Legions with ‘Redemptionary Brigades’."

It is asinine to consider, for even a moment, that just because those squirrely bug tanks might perform better that their technical flaws can be overlooked!”\n\n “With all due respect!” Lucent Eclipse countered with a shake of his head, shooting up from his seat. “It is equally asinine to stuff our armored corps in cheap pieces of tin that we know are inferior to other models! That’ll cost ponies their lives, General!” \n\n “Their lives? They’re soldiers, that’s what they do! Those red bastards might be backwards savages, but they got the right idea. Our tanks need to be mass produced and our tanks need to be modular! We have to be able to repair them in the field, at a motorpool; not ship them back to the factory!” Batton hissed as he opened the folder. The thestral tapped at several pictures intelligence had stolen from the Changelings for emphasis. “These bugs of yours? All their tanks are too complicated! I don’t care how large the caliber of the gun is, if it takes up too much fuel and can’t easily be repaired, how in the Nightmare's sacred name am I supposed to maneuver with that?”\n\n “The Changeling engineers are some of the best in the world, despite their heresy. Quality over quantity, General Batton. That is how we will win the next war,” Eclipse groaned as he sat back down in his chair. \n\n “We won’t win a single war if my tanks break down every ten miles! Give me three hundred thousand gallons of fuel and I could be in Canterlot in a week with the Firstborn Legion! I just need to make sure my tanks can keep up!” Batton yelled, sweeping the papers off the table with his hoof as the pair continued their heated debate."
