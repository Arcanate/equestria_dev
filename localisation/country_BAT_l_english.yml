Our exile of generations on Zebrica mattered little for she would have her righteous army when she returned as the prophecy promised. And on that night of nights, 1,000 years after the Great Catastrophe…\n\nThe Elements of Harmony tore her asunder.\n\nThe accursed charms ripped divinity from her holy hooves and devolved her to a lesser form. She had returned though, Nightmare Moon had returned! Her mortal form may be weakened in Princess Luna, but it was a sign! Despite her weakened state, Chiropterra rejoiced for months at her rebirth; there was hope.\n\nFor seven years we have intensified our efforts and expanded our operations on Equus. We have strained already soured relations between Thestrals and Ponies, sabotaged efforts to modernize the Equestrian military even after the Changeling heretics captured Canterlot, and have embedded our assets across the Equestrian territories.\n\nOur ancestors arrived on Zebrica with spears and bows on rickety triremes bursting from the seam with their families. Our exile here, our removal from our homeland will be avenged! We will return to Equestria in massive ships armed with tanks and machine guns, each blessed by the moon herself!\n\nAnd if we fail? We shall wait a millennia more. We are patient, we are watching, and we will return!"

bat.9.t:0 "Report #3112"
bat.9.d:0 "Eternal Eclipse frowned as he used an old abacus to crunch the numbers on the relocation of Labourer Subclass A-951 to Labourer Subclass A-956. The stallion did not struggle with the math, numbers were his strong suit. His old abacus just did not go high enough to account for the influx of new labourers enlightened in the last raid. Eternal was also not willing to use the new ‘slide ruler’ his grandson Lucent got him for his birthday.\n\n Allocating the labourers to their new professions based upon their old ones was hardly a trifling task either, but his equipment was slowing him down. It was rather ironic considering the stallion’s age. His mind was sharp as ever, but his body had slowed to a crawl. The ‘equipment’ he used to secure his spot on the Legion Council had worn thin.\n\n Even armed with a new tool, Eclipse wondered if it would even be enough.He never denied his feebleness now, the matters of the military were best left to younger soldiers like Lucent after all.\n\n He was just letting his frustration get the best of him, he would try to learn the slide ruler once Lucent came to visit for their afternoon tea. Eternal consoled himself that he was still useful as he reassigned two thousand, nine hundred, and thirty-three new labourers to their assignments across the munitions plants. Their children would be turned over to the academies for training.\n\n He hoped that Lucen would bring the mint tea, it always seemed to calm his nerves."

bat.10.t:0 "The Life Of A Labourer"
bat.10.d:0 "Kinta Kunte never paid no mind to his mother’s words to not sail too far to the east, the young zebra always found them to be nagging. It was a hag’s tale among the fisherfolk of their village, the lost remnants of an army kidnapping any they could get their hooves on. With the Storm King gone there was no reason not to expand to new spots!\n\n Kinta wished he had listened to her.\n\n  Their ship had drifted too far while they were trawling for krill, he had been below when the raid happened. A dozen pegasi and thestrals landed on their deck, killed the captain, and rounded them all up in a matter of minutes. A unicorn was brought down and cast a strange spell, forcing them into a deep sleep.\n\n  When Kinta woke up, he found himself in the Labourer’s quarters with the other captives. Some were killed trying to escape in the first week, another died from wounds after her flogging for interrupting a sermon to Nightmare Moon, and the last threw himself from the scaffolding down in the mines. Kinta was the last one from his ship after the first month. \n\n  And he has been there ever since, working all day and into the night. They do not let him near any boats, his thestral overlords know that Kinta would try to run just as his companions had. As the thestral captain who gave him his new name said; ‘You will mine, your children will fish, and their children will be citizens.’"

bat.11.t:0 "The Sacrifices On The Road To Success"
bat.11.d:0 "Autumn Breeze smiled as he nipped on the edge of a cigar, the tobacco paired well it the champagne he had taken on his last visit to Prance. Before ascending to the Legion Council, Breeze was quite proud to be something of an aficionado of Equestrian vineyards. While undercover a few of his more charged reviews even made it into national papers for a great deal of praise, of course his handlers quickly put a stop to that growing fame.\n\n “It was a danger to the mission after all,  just like you,” he mused as he let the smoke roll from his nostrils before he turned to face his acquaintance for the night. The Equestrian agent was bound to a chair, bloodied and broken a dozen times over through their previous festivities. Whatever nonsense he tried to gargle past his broken teeth came out as incomprehensible slurs.\n\n “Save your strength, I am just enjoying a break myself,” Autumn chuckled out as he took a small sip from his wine. “I do want to congratulate you, my friend. In nearly thirty years of operations I’ve been involved with, I’ve never seen somepony come so very close to actually proving we exist.”\n\n The agent choked out another gargle of bile and thrashed again his restraints, glaring past the one eye he had left.\n\n “I will take that as your modest appreciation for my kind words, but in any case,” Autumn added as he finished off his glass. “If you’re going to have to disappear, we’re going to have a bit more fun first; just me and you.”\n\n The thestral slowly sauntered towards the record player, choosing a more modern Octavian piece as he took the burning ember of the cigar with his hoofs. As the mare on the recording strum her cello to life, Breeze recounted how much he enjoyed his work as he resumed his interrogation.\n\n The agent gave him what he wanted, eventually."

bat.12.t:0 "Of Love And Friendship"
bat.12.d:0 "Bright Opal never found himself to be particularly suited with most mares, a doctorate in physics and psychology usually ended with him trying to dissect his date’s minds more than actually caring about their interests.\n\n Those tendencies did not make him popular, but then he met Mystic Belle.\n\n She was quickly becoming everything to him. Ponies were hard to understand, prone to fits of emotion and irrational thought; even his own family was strained to care when he went on tirades about the numbers and mystical elements of crystals being harnessed for power..\n\n It was in one of these impromptu speeches that Mystic first approached him, for the first time his grandstanding at a bar among his colleagues had a desirable outcome. She was perfect; she let him pick away at her mind, she picked away at his, and her love of physics was only rivaled by her attachment to him.\n\n It was so easy with her, just like with math; being with her just added up.\n\n The only downside was how much the mare traveled, but Bright could not bear to hold that against her. That was her job after all, even if it meant a visit to Zebrica every few months to ensure the relief organization she ran in Warzena was going well.\n\n Mystic Belle was caring like that and Trotbert loved her all the more for it."

bat.13.t:0 "A Soldier's Life"
bat.13.d:0 "“Listen up!” Lightning Charm barked out as she trotted out before the Firstborn Legion, the feeling of over a thousand eyes bore in on her as she flipped a Stalliongrad rifle around in her hooves.\n\n “In light of some confusion among the rank and file, I have been asked by the Council to resolve these matters...I have elected to do so personally, so that each Legionnaire understands the new weapon system,” Lightning Charm hissed out to the soldiers. “This is the Stalliongrad SVETA rifle, it is a semi-automatic rifle and fires a 7.62mm cartridge accurately up to 500 meteres!”\n\n “Let me be clear! This is a weapon designed by a bunch, deranged godless heathens that Celestia let leave Equestria! They are exiles too and enemies of Equestria; but they have developed a weapon that surpasses our own!” the commander exclaimed as she swung the weapon around, ensuring everypony got a good look at it.\n\n “We are behind the curve, Legionnaires, and I am tired of hearing complaints from your commanders about there being a...reluctance among the ranks to adapt to the new weapons. Our breechloaders are not top of the line anymore, just like your father’s muskets, and like their grandfather’s swords!”\n\n “This rifle-” Lightning barked out as she held the SVETA above our head “-will be repurposed and learned, we will make it our own in time! But if I get any more reports about a legion dragging their heels in adapting to these new arms, I’m going to use them for target practice!”\n\n “Hold your officers accountable, hold yourselves accountable, and get it done!” she barked out as she slammed the butt of the rifle onto the stage. “Dismissed!”"

bat.14.t:0 "In The Embrace Of The Moon"
bat.14.d:0 "Gwedi always loved the Lunar Festival, it was the time when the Auxiliary divisions and the Legionnaire forces engaged in war games against each other to settle rivalries and praise the eternal goddess with copious amounts of booze and extra rations to celebrate. Most of the time the Legionnaire units trounced the Auxiliaries, but Gwedi led his engineers to three consecutive victories this year.\n\n Not that there was any real bad blood between the Auxiliaries and the Legions, all of that had been thawed out centuries ago. Legion might get the better equipment and the most dangerous missions, but there was no denying that the Auxiliaries had the most faith; and if Gwedi knew anything is that it was faith that got folks through the hard times.\n\n Gwedi’s mother had been a labourer, but when she converted and gave birth to him; Gwedi himself became qualified for the Auxiliary. When he was old enough he sprung at the opportunity without hesitation; better rations for his mother and a chance to secure his children citizenship under the benevolent night? What more could a Zebra ask for?\n\n The best part though of the Lunar Festival was the sermons. Gwedi never found himself proper in the temples for the goddess, but the sermons during the Festival were always around a dozen casks of the richest liquor they could find.\n\n When Lunar Hail stepped up onto an empty cask, Gwedi raised a healthy glass with every other soldier of Chiropterra following suit. The thestral priestess spoke with a fire and fury that would make even the most grizzled legionnaire blush. She promised an eternity in the night’s embrace for those that died righteously in battle, a divine heaven with enough warm beds and partners for every soul that fell in her service. Gwedi and all the auxiliaries hung on her words, in the thin moonlight and haze of the drink; Lunar Hail almost looked like Nightmare Moon herself!"
