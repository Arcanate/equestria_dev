BAT_yet_another_failure_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, Operation Moonshine has failed. It is the second rebellion our bloodlines have lost and it will take the powers of the Nightmare herself to convince our nation that we should prepare for a third attempt. We must look to our current state of affairs and determine what needs to be changed so that we can last another thousand years."
BAT_emergency_session:0 "Turn Back the Clock"
BAT_emergency_session_desc:0 "Although our efforts in Equus have failed, we are still a minute from midnight! While the heretical sun may have driven us back into the shadows, around us are a great many rich and fertile lands. It is time, for the future of Chiropterra, that we look to the world that is immediately around us; Zebrica."
BAT_limited_diplomacy:0 "Prepare the Second Great Conquest"
BAT_limited_diplomacy_desc:0 "As we pivot away from reclaiming Equestria for our goddess, we must lay the seeds of our success on Zebrica. We cannot forget why we are taking the steps in this great crusade, not for greed or gold; but for our goddess alone! The Nightmare needs us to secure these lands from the profligates and heretics, for only we can use its bounty for her righteous cause!"
BAT_pacification_brigades:0 "Form the Imperial Frontier Forces"
BAT_pacification_brigades_desc:0 "Our Legions dominate our enemies on the field of battle, but when a war ends; what then? When our first ancestors carved out modern day Chiropterra from the natives that sullied her soil, they formed deicated units to keep the peace. We shall follow the lessons of this history and form our own Frontier Corpss to serve, protect, and ensure the loyalty of our new territories."
BAT_strike_at_tobuck:0 "Strike Down the Savages"
BAT_strike_at_tobuck_desc:0 "The time has come for our strength to be shown to these heretics! Tobuck and Zarantia are lands without order and without faith, ruled by petty desposts and barely worthy to be considered nations. We shall not underestimate the conniving warlords and their armies however. We shall treat them as if they were are greatest enemies, we shall pour our hearts and souls into this war! For the Legion! For the Nightmare!"
BAT_deal_with_the_warlords:0 "Woe To the Vanquished"
BAT_deal_with_the_warlords_desc:0 "The rogue warlords of the desert have been captured by our forces, now all that matters is to decide what to do with them. While there have been talks of simply executing the lot of them, the Legionary Council has met to decide their fate. The debate is expected to take several takes and require many interrogations, but the Nightmare is a just mistress; so we shall follow her example."
BAT_secure_tobuck:0 "Reorganise the Eastern Territories"
BAT_secure_tobuck_desc:0 "With the warlords dealt with, the resistance crushed, and the civilians pacified; we have done what none of the petty despots of the natives could...secured Tobuck. Now that our invasion is over, we must no longer be conquers; but rather protectors. Tobuck is our territory now, it is the territory of Nightmare Moon, and a vaued part of her empire. We will not let it fall into disarray again."
BAT_cooperate_with_colthage:0 "The Enemy Of My Enemy..."
BAT_cooperate_with_colthage_desc:0 "Whoever rules the Colthaginian Empire matters little to us at this time. Despite their status as heretics with a maddening polytheistic pantheon, they have use to us as potential allies. The Hippogriffs are an imposing force and a danger to our great expansion. Much like how our ancestors fought in the Legions of old, we need somepony alongside us against the enemy."
BAT_help_their_military:0 "Assist the Colthaginians"
BAT_help_their_military_desc:0 "The Colthaginians are fighting with equipment captured from the Yetis and antiques carried by their fathers, it is time we enlighten them to the true power of the modern age; machine guns, rifles, and whatever else we can spare will be given to our fair weather friends in the hopes of granting them a fighting chance in the struggle ahead."
BAT_the_gamble:0 "Cast the Die"
BAT_the_gamble_desc:0 "Warzena lies just to our east and barely stands on a single leg. The Zebra nation will be enlightened to our righteous cause and we shall join them in our pact, but this cannot be done with the Hippogriffs hanging over their shoulder; whispering false notions of 'harmony' to them. We shall make our demands known and if the Hippogriffs dare stand against us? So be it."
BAT_prepare_two_pronged_push:0 "Operation Spit Roast"
BAT_prepare_two_pronged_push_desc:0 "War! The Hippogriffs have made their intentions clear and justified our operations! While the battles rage across Zebrica, we must coordiante with our ally to the East! Coordinated offensives from both sides will disorient and weaken our foe. Peace will only come when Chirropterrans and Colthaginians stand shoulder to shoulder against the great, harmonic menace! Forward, to victory!"
BAT_strike_them_down:0 "Push the Hippogriffs Back Into the Sea"
BAT_strike_them_down_desc:0 "Stand firm! The Hippogriffs once thought that their strength would drive us into the sea? The Nightmare laughs at their insolence, for now we turn to face them with all our might! Greater enemies have died by our hooves and greater enemies shall fall in our future! These Hippogriffs shall be driven back into the sea!"
BAT_fighting_on_the_homefront:0 "Sway The Old Guard"
BAT_fighting_on_the_homefront_desc:0 "The conquest of new lands does not mend the failures of Operation Moonshine, this is clear. In hushed whispers and worried glances, the old families speak of the Legionnary Council simply trying to mend their failure with smaller gains. Perhaps they are right? But their attitudes need to change. Lord Commander Autumn Breeze shall host a gala at his plantation, the Council hopes that the patriarch of Clan Reed can sway his fellow atristocracy back in line."
BAT_reorganize_local_governance:0 "Embrace State Capitalism"
BAT_reorganize_local_governance_desc:0 "The competition that capitalism breeds weeds out the weak and unsustainable businesses, but sometimes a guiding hoof is needed to ensure that the country's economy charges forward without the meddling of businessponies. Our economy shall sustain itself, we shall not hide it any longer! While we may not offer the same stock options, we can certainly gurantee that the state's businesses are too big to fail."
BAT_reorganize_agriculture:0 "Reorganise the Agricultural Sector"
BAT_reorganize_agriculture_desc:0 "Our agricultural sector has been weakened by the strain of war. Each success and each failure consumes valuable manpower and supplies, hemorrhaging our food supplies over time. By mechanizing our farms the same way we have some of our military divisions, we can not only free up more bodies for the industrial sector or front; but also increase our avalible food supply!"
BAT_limited_unionism:0 "The Chiropterran Development Fund"
BAT_limited_unionism_desc:0 "By expanding our allocations to the industrial sector with a larger development fund, we are investing in our future success! Although it may harm us financially now, but pouring money into greater industrial research and companies we can improvce the compliance and effectiveness of industry at all levels."
BAT_army_development:0 "The Military Industrial Complex"
BAT_army_development_desc:0 "The industry required to sustain our massive military build-up can only be met by government subsidies into industry itself. To keep our military top of the line, we embrace this unique balance between industry, research, and government against the critics who warn of tying our commercial assets even deeper with out military forces. With this change, we will be able to research more and choose which projects best suit our force."
BAT_labourer_leasing:0 "Labourer Leasing"
BAT_labourer_leasing_desc:0 "Although Labouerers belong to the state, sometimes there are simply too many for the state to use on all projects. Because we have an overflow of labouerers, it only makes sense that we allow what few foriegn companies on our soil and local businesses to lease this free labour from us...at a reasonable tax of course."
BAT_the_propaganda_machine:0 "Hearts and Minds"
BAT_the_propaganda_machine_desc:0 "Operation Moonshine might have failed, but Chiropterra has not! Our recent battles have given our propaganda machine all the film, features, and pictures it needed to drum up its messaging for the first time in centuries. We do not have to look back to our ancestors alone for heroes anymore, for there are living legends among us now! Crowds line up at recruiting offices for blocks after newsreels show our brave Legionnaires on the front."
BAT_expand_civilian_governance:0 "Expand Local Civilian Governments"
BAT_expand_civilian_governance_desc:0 "The Legionary Council might act as our supreme authority, but it would be foolish to have them weigh in on local district disputes and the laws of small towns. By expanding the power of our local government officials, we can encourage greater participation in government while expanding our power simultaneously!"
BAT_remember_your_duty:0 "The Thousand Year Struggle"
BAT_remember_your_duty_desc:0 "It has taken time and effort to remind our people of our duty. One cannot blame them for losing faith, for they struggled for a thousand years preparing for their triumph. As one generation passes onto the next though, we have rekindled the flames of patriotism within them all. The first great steps on another thousand year struggle have been made and they all take pride in being at its forefront."
BAT_new_settlement_initiative:0 "New Settlement Initiative"
BAT_new_settlement_initiative_desc:0 "As we expand our territory east, we also must condier the land we have. In the past, it was hard to create new settlements or even move away from the larger population centers of cities. With increase automation and greater infastructure, it has become feasible to settle even the most desolate parts of Chiropterra with permanent settlements. This new initiative will encourage our people to settle in these new homes and enjoy the comforts of modernity there."
BAT_youth_service_corps:0 "Form the Youth Service Corps"
BAT_youth_service_corps_desc:0 "The Nightmare does not need to inspire the loyalty of the faitful, for they are already in her embrace. She must enkindle the love of the foals to ensure that the future is in her name. The establishment of the Youth Service Corps will lead to the betterment of our young ponies and inspire future generations of loyal, dependable, and honest Chiropterrans."
BAT_expand_operations:0 "Expand the Hoof's Operations"
BAT_expand_operations_desc:0 "The Hoof of the Nighmare must grow as we have. While our traditional intelligence agency has been with us since our first landings, there have been few innovations in their conduct of operations on domestic soil. While they remained on the bleeding edge of foriegn espionage, by granting them greater power in Chiropterra itself we can expand their support of the state here."
BAT_the_war_at_sea:0 "The War At Sea"
BAT_the_war_at_sea_desc:0 "The largest border Chiropterra has is with the ocean, meaning that we must have a capable navy to defend ourselves with. By reviewing our current doctrine and comparing with other developments from our own expeirences and that of others, we can expand our naval knowledge far beyond our current capabilities. What took others years will only take us months for the Nightmare guides us with her shadow!"
BAT_develop_the_shipyards:0 "Shipyard Expansion Scheme"
BAT_develop_the_shipyards_desc:0 "While we are guided by the Nightmare, we also must be aware of our capabilities. The shipyards of Chiropterra will be modernized to not only rival that of our enemies, but surpass them! Our ships shall be remembered for centuries and their legacy will rule the waves around us! In a thousand years, the weight of our naval power shall crash against our true enemy! For now we will sharpen our fangs on the prey we find around us."
BAT_improve_the_submarine_fleet:0 "The Seawind MKII"
BAT_improve_the_submarine_fleet_desc:0 "Effective, hard to detect, and dangerous; it is easy to see why the Legionary Council has favored the development of the submarine. Our current hulls are out of date and if we wish to have our wolfpacks be the most dangerous in the sea, we will have to give them the tools to be successful!"
BAT_improve_the_destroyers:0 "The Moonfire MKII"
BAT_improve_the_destroyers_desc:0 "Cheap, maneuverable, and swift; it is also easy to see why the Council favors this surface ship. Although not as effective at raiding as our submarines, our destroyers are ancient in comparison to that of our enemies. New hulls and new guns mounted on them will make our surface fleet stronger. It is wiser to start at the ground up for reotrofits with the support ships rather than starting with the battleships afterall."
BAT_fuel_conservation:0 "Fuel Conservation Initiative"
BAT_fuel_conservation_desc:0 "As we improve our naval capabilities, we will also need to allocate a greater stockpile of fuel to the surface and submarine fleets. Although this is a daunting task, it has a simple solution; expand the reserves. By constructing additional fuel silos, we can increase our total storage capacity ensuring an avalibility of fuel during longterm operations."
BAT_the_lunar_marines:0 "Form the Imperial Marine Corps"
BAT_the_lunar_marines_desc:0 "Our enemies shall be placed under siege! Under lockdown! The Nightmare's Imperial Marines will storm their ranches, homes, and liberate them from the heels of their masters! Our marines are merciless, dangerous, well-oiled machines that will land on their shores without warning."
BAT_convoy_raiding:0 "Supply Line Disruption Tactics"
BAT_convoy_raiding_desc:0 "We cannot match the the operation range of our surface fleet with that of our enemies, therefore we shall dedicate most of our efforts to our reliable raiding groups. While the waters around Chiropterra shall be secured, we shall cause havoc upon the enemy wherever their ships sail in the ocean! Their will be no escape from our hunt!"
BAT_operation_range_expansion:0 "Long Distance Operations"
BAT_operation_range_expansion_desc:0 "Our surface fleet needs to go past our shores, to be able to meet the enemy anywhere they are found. While we cannot simply take over every island between here and Equestria to build up a series of naval bases, we can instead focus on improving our doctrine with the capabilities we have to greater expand the flexibility of our operations."

BAT_look_to_the_economy:0 "A Failure On the Homefront"
BAT_look_to_the_economy_desc:0 "We have failed in our efforts, but we cannot hold only the Legionnaire responsible. Our homefront was just as critical to Moonshine as our soldiers were. We must prepare for our next crusade and build an economy that is able to support it, even if it takes another thousand years to prepare."
BAT_strenghten_the_commission:0 "Tighten the Grip"
BAT_strenghten_the_commission_desc:0 "The treatment of our native Labourers has been too relaxed. The restraints on the Commission allowed for silent protest and 'protections' among the few dissidents there were. We must tighten our hold over this critical part of the economy and not allow even one soul to think of anything beyond service."
BAT_intensify_raids:0 "Calibrated Acquisition Operations"
BAT_intensify_raids_desc:0 "Our raiding parties will be equipped with our most modern equipment and soldiers. We cannot afford to limit ourselves in these missions anymore, by diverting more resources to each raid we should be able to enjoy greater returns on the labourers acquired."
BAT_free_reign_to_LMRD:0 "LMRD Test Subject Procurement Standardisation"
BAT_free_reign_to_LMRD_desc:0 "The LMRD is an invaluable asset to Chiropterra and we cannot throtle their need of test subjects anymore. We shall finally grant them free reign to take whichever labourers they require for experiments without the need for approval from the Native Affairs Commission."
BAT_control_collars:0 "Behavioral Correction Collars"
BAT_control_collars_desc:0 "Behavioral Correction collars have a simple, but deadly design. A small explosive charge is encased in five pounds of durable steel. A microphone and a radio wave receiver and transmitter allow for the location of labourers to be monitored along with their conversations. Need be, the collars can be detonated remotely."
BAT_work_for_your_bread:0 "Food Ration Standardisation"
BAT_work_for_your_bread_desc:0 "One of our founders a thousand years ago wrote a simple directive as we established ourselves; if one works, one eats. We shall apply this straightforward directive to our labourers who will only be given their rations after they have performed their allotted duties for the day. Those who do not work, do not eat."
BAT_dedicated_research_centers:0 "Special Access Zones"
BAT_dedicated_research_centers_desc:0 "The LMRD and Native Affairs Commission have presented a bold new research strategy, aimed at collecting large units of data at once from an enclosed population. By combining a labourer barracks and worksite into one 'Special Access Zone', we can completely restrict their movement and allow the LMRD to observe them as they work."
BAT_reforming_the_commission:0 "The Velvet Glove"
BAT_reforming_the_commission_desc:0 "To even deny one part of our population the benevolence of the Nightmare's sacred reign is sowing the seeds of our own destruction. We cannot allow the Native Affairs Commission to continue in its current state and we must examine our treatment of the labourers. We must follow in our Empress' example, we must improve."
BAT_mandatory_temple_attendence:0 "Mandatory Moonday Attendence"
BAT_mandatory_temple_attendence_desc:0 "The Labourers had always been given the option to attend services at our temples, for faith is something that cannot be forced. By making temple attendence mandatory, we aim to provide them with a spiritual outlet and provide a dedicated day of rest in their week of labour. It is our hope that in time the exposure to the temple and holy word will passively convert many."
BAT_the_one_generation_rule:0 "The One Generation Rule"
BAT_the_one_generation_rule_desc:0 "A child shall not be punished for the sins of their father, is that not what the Moonspeakers say? We will adapt our laws and allow the children of Labourers who convert to the true word of the goddess to be equal citizens in one generation, instead of two. If their parents are truly faithful, so too will their children be!"
BAT_improve_working_conditions:0 "Labourer Lodgings Improvement"
BAT_improve_working_conditions_desc:0 "Home is where the heart is and if one's home is two sheets of tin without running water, one's heart is not going to be its work. It is only logical that we provide basic living conditions to our labourers, for they are not slaves; only wayward souls we are attempting to save."
BAT_accountable_overseers:0 "Limit Physical Punishment"
BAT_accountable_overseers_desc:0 "The whip is a tool of weaker ponies, we will be smarter and stronger than that. The overseers of our Labourers must be held to the same standard as any other citizen of Chiropterra. By limiting their legal ability to inflict physical punishment, we predict a sharp decline in cases of Labourers perishing in hostile working conditions."
BAT_decent_living_quarters:0 "Loyalty Shall Be Rewarded"
BAT_decent_living_quarters_desc:0 "For those that work without incident and are faithful to Nightmare Moon, why not allow them luxuries? There is no reason to deny a labourer access to books or a permit to reward hard labour? Why not even grant those that push past their quotas a chance to keep what they earn for profit? There are many reforms we will make and all will reward the loyal."
BAT_additional_labourer_acquisition:0 "Additional Labourer Procurement"
BAT_additional_labourer_acquisition_desc:0 "Raids are violent and prone to failure, but they are not the only way to procure labourers. Our agents will begin operations to direct refugee ships towards our waters or even find those desperate enough to volunteer for a new life in the mythical Chiropterra for the Nightmare."
BAT_the_carrot_and_the_stick:0 "No Place For Cruelty"
BAT_the_carrot_and_the_stick_desc:0 "Cruelty is inefficent. It is an emotional and wasteful expression of weaker ponies and their false ideologies. We must embrace this fact. We shall enable those who enforce our law better means to control our population through more benevolent means under the philosophy of the carrot and the stick."
BAT_harsher_conditions:0 "Harsh Yet Fair"
BAT_harsher_conditions_desc:0 "We will look to reform our justice system, but in doing this our laws will be harsher. All the same, they will be much more fair. No pony is above the laws of the Nightmare, no one sentient creature will stand above others. Justice is blind, but the Nightmare is not!"
BAT_service_for_freedom:0 "Freedom Through Service"
BAT_service_for_freedom_desc:0 "Service gurantees citizenship! Labourers of Chiropterra rejoice! All who serve for their comitted time in the Legions of Nightmare Moon will be granted their freedom at the end of their term. Those who are wounded or medically discharged with honors will be placed in auxiliary battalions, but are still eligible. Are you doing your part for a better future?"
BAT_use_our_connections:0 "The Underground Economy"
BAT_use_our_connections_desc:0 "Let us not pretend that there is an economy in the world that runs beneath the shadows of every state. As children of the darkness, we will thrive in it. Our agents shall expand our connections into these illegal markets and shell corporations to greatly increase our assets."
BAT_equipment_smuggling:0 "Gray Market Contacts"
BAT_equipment_smuggling_desc:0 "As we press into the underground economy, we shall enjoy the fruits of our labours. Several shipping companies from Haukland and Skyfall shall begin to loose shipments in international waters along the coast of Saddle Arabia, but their shared insurance conglomorate Lunar Protections will always reimburse them handsomely."
BAT_the_poppy_fields:0 "The Poppies Of Love"
BAT_the_poppy_fields_desc:0 "Praise be to Nightmare Moon and the bounties of her harvest. Chiropterra is a harsh enviornment, even by Zebrican standards. This however does not stop the cultivation of our crops, including that of the poppy plant. We can extract valuable medicine from the poppy plant such as morphine, but we also must acknowledge its volatile recreational purposes..."
BAT_literal_drug_smuggling:0 "Drown Their Markets"
BAT_literal_drug_smuggling_desc:0 "While our own ponies will benefit from the sale and cultivation of the poppy plant, we shall drown our enemies in cheap, dangerous opiods. Our goal is not profit, but proliferation. We shall sink the claws of addiction and strife deep into our enemy's most vulnerable and spread like a disease from them."
BAT_shell_companies:0 "Shell Company Procurements"
BAT_shell_companies_desc:0 "Our contacts in the grey markets have solidified different sectors of control. Sanctioning a few small squads of infiltrators, we shall secure the last few 'signatures' we need to gain full control of several different companies. Through these our reach will be greater and even more hidden."
BAT_extract_equestrian_experts:0 "Equestrian Academic Extraction"
BAT_extract_equestrian_experts_desc:0 "Several Equestrian academics are researching different projects that interest us. By staging several honeypot operations and the occasional disapperance we can siphon off the best and brightest of our heretical enemies with them being none the wiser."
BAT_electronics_development:0 "The Colossus"
BAT_electronics_development_desc:0 "Through the use of vacuum tubes and other electronic marvels, we can develop an electronic machine that can compute certain equations and ciphers for us! Our leading electronics experts predict massive leaps and bounds in processing ability and power with newer models of the Colossus as well!"
BAT_calibrate_military_industry:0 "Bolster Military Production"
BAT_calibrate_military_industry_desc:0 "More factories means more guns. More guns means more soldiers. The math here is rather simple, but we will have to commit time to consolidate our national assets to refocus on military production. Once we pool our resources, we will be able to enjoy the benefit of more factories, which means more guns...ecetera, ecetera."
BAT_synthethic_oil:0 "Coal Liquefaction"
BAT_synthethic_oil_desc:0 "CTL or Coal to Liquid Fuels is a process in which coal is, rather obviously, converted into fuel. Although this method has of synthesis has been around for several years, we have yet to fully invest in the ingenuity of the idea. By embracing this new method of accessing critical fuels, we can bolster our reserves."
BAT_mining_mechanisation:0 "Mining Mechanisation"
BAT_mining_mechanisation_desc:0 "A machine can two twice the work of an average pony, save for a few anomalous earth ponies among our miners. Be that as it may, by mechanizing our mines we can extract more, dig deeper, and enjoy a much larger return from them."
BAT_improve_logistics:0 "Improve Inter-District Infrastructure"
BAT_improve_logistics_desc:0 "It is time we examine the state of our roads between districts, meaning that we must take drastic steps to improve infastrcuture throughout our country. By building onto exisiting railroads and roads, we can create a comprehensive Inter-District travel network that enables mobility of our citizens but also critical logistics."
BAT_developmental_effort:0 "Academic Modernisation"
BAT_developmental_effort_desc:0 "The universities of Yale or the School of Magic in Equestria will have nothing on our academies, once we finish modernizing them of course. It is no secret that our isolation forces us to be creative, but it also hobbles our ability to stay ahead of the curve academically. By granting more funding to our insitutions of higher learning, we can benefit from their knowledge."
BAT_medical_research_development:0 "Inter-District Medical Network"
BAT_medical_research_development_desc:0 "By expanding state control of hospitals and other medical facilities, we can ensure they are staffed by properly trained doctors with the most modern equipment possible. Any citizen or labourer in need of medical attention will recieve it in new, start of the art facilities. The health of our ponies is the health of our nation."
BAT_crop_diversification:0 "Diversify and Specialize"
BAT_crop_diversification_desc:0 "Diversification is the process of allocating capital in a way that reduces the exposure to any one particular asset or risk. Or while specialization is the allocation of capital into one particular asset for the greatest reward. We will find the balance between both with our new Industrial Fund, dedicated to allocating grants to different parts of our economy."
BAT_coconut_crab_ranching:0 "Coconut Crab Ranching"
BAT_coconut_crab_ranching_desc:0 "The Coconut Crab is the largest land animal with an exoskeleton that does not use magical means for its survival. These large creatures were common in Chiropterra and have been hunted for centuries for their meat, nearly to the point of extinction. By expanding our protection of the crabs and allocating many more to sanctioned ranches, we can cultivate them safely."
BAT_a_life_of_luxury:0 "Luxuries For the Masses"
BAT_a_life_of_luxury_desc:0 "As our economy becomes more and more efficent, our experts have found startling accounts of surplus and excess. We are out producing our projections for the next century, meaning that we can afford to shower our ponies with commercial goods and luxuries."

BAT_examine_military_procedures:0 "Examine What Went Wrong"
BAT_examine_military_procedures_desc:0 "We have failed to bring the Eternal Night and Nightmare Moon remains lost to us, but we cannot give up hope! We must think back to our ancestors when they first arrived on these shores, we must follow in their example and lay the groundwork for the next war. Even if it must be in another thousand years."
BAT_new_officers_from_equestria:0 "Welcome the New Exiles"
BAT_new_officers_from_equestria_desc:0 "With the failure of Operation Moonshine, we must arrange for a withdrawl of significant assets from Equestria. There is a silver lining in that the officers we embedded into the Equestrian military can now return to us with their experiences and sympatherizers."
BAT_support_squads:0 "Auxiliary Combat Role Training"
BAT_support_squads_desc:0 "Our Auxiliaries cannot be wasted on menial tasks anymore! Some of our most loyal units comprise of Auxiliary forces, therefore we must integrate them wholly into the Legions. Seperate support companies mixed in with regular troops will give our frontline units greater flexibility."
BAT_moonspeakers_in_military_roles:0 "Adapt the Luna Nova"
BAT_moonspeakers_in_military_roles_desc:0 ""
BAT_ranger_corps:0 "Her Imperial Majesty's Legionary Ranger Corps"
BAT_ranger_corps_desc:0 "We must develop a dedicated light infantry corps to better improve the lethality of our divisions. It is with this course of action that we open our first 'Ranger' school in the Howling Hills region. We shall test candidates mental, physical, and martial prowess in order to form a specialized ranger corps that can be integrated with our main infantry units.
BAT_equipment_modernisation:0 "Equipment Modernisation"
BAT_equipment_modernisation_desc:0 "The world around us is rapidly evolving with major technological advancements made in a matter of months rather than years. We cannot afford to fall behind. It is too costly and time consuming to consistently rely on espionage to acquire new equipment for us to copy, so we must subsidize our own researchers to improve upon our own equipment."
BAT_legacy_of_the_shadowbolts:0 "Legacy of the Shadowbolts"
BAT_legacy_of_the_shadowbolts_desc:0 "The Shadowbolts were a dedicated flying formation from the first coming of Nightmare moon known for their ferocity in the skies! Their night flying is legendary and their accomplishments in the skies even greater! We shall look to their memory as we develop our flying corps capabilities, our new planes and doctrine will echo their legacy!"
BAT_troop_support:0 "Combined Arms Tactics"
BAT_troop_support_desc:0 "The use of combined arms represents the future of warfare. Coordinated assaults of infantry, artillery, and armor to destroy the enemy in quick, decisive attacks will win us our next war. Gone are the days of wasteful tactics and mass infantry attacks without proper support, this new doctrine will pave the way to victory with overwhelming firepower."
BAT_new_bombercraft:0 "Strategic Destruction"
BAT_new_bombercraft_desc:0 "In war we are not just fighting military forces anymore, we are fighting nations. Every city is an asset, every civilian in it a labourer for their war effort. Some on the Council might not approve of this new approach to warfare, but we must strike at all assets of the enemy in order to end a war as quickly as possible by bombing the enemy into absolute submission."
BAT_the_fuel_issue:0 "The Imperial Strategic Petroleum Reserve"
BAT_the_fuel_issue_desc:0 "We are a small nation and our resources can easily be stretched thin in a prolonged conflict, why even our economy now is relient upon fuel. Our limited contact with the world at large means that we cannot so easily acquire it either. By opening a series of synthetic plants and establishing a means to store vast quantities of oil for long periods of time, we can prepare a vast reserve for military use."
BAT_army_motorisation:0 "Legionary Mechanisation"
BAT_army_motorisation_desc:0 "There is a tribe of warriors on Zebrica that can march fifty miles a day and still fight, but they are only carrying spears and shields. A modern soldier carries much more and his support unit's wagons. We must fully motorize our military so that we can move a hundred fifty miles a day and fight with the full force of our modern Legions!"
BAT_armoured_trains:0 "Armoured Trains"
BAT_armoured_trains_desc:0 "Railways are the backbone of our logistics no matter the amount of trucks we may have. It is important that we provide this critical asset of military infastructure with the means to defend itself. By implementing the use of armored trains, we cannot only improve the defense of our logistics but also some units dedicated to protecting railways to be used elsewhere."
BAT_extensive_planning:0 "Strategy in Depth"
BAT_extensive_planning_desc:0 "Tactics are the plans at the smallest unit level and srategy is at the highest, but their overall goals must align for success. Our strategic mission in any military campaign or operation must be clear so that commanders on all levels understand its intent."
BAT_military_logistics_department:0 "Legionary Logistics Corp"
BAT_military_logistics_department_desc:0 "An army marches on its stomach, or so the saying goes. With the adoption of vehicles, modern weapons, and other tools of warefare; an army marches on its stomach and fights with whatever the motorpool can provide. Our improved Logistics Corps shall ensure that our army has whatever it needs wherever it needs it."
BAT_joint_chiefs_of_staff:0 "Joint Chiefs of Staff"
BAT_joint_chiefs_of_staff_desc:0 "Only a fool would have different branches of our military compete with one another for supplies or resources, but we are limited in who we can provide with what. By adopting a Joint Chiefs of Staff to inform the Legionary Council of the different branches' needs, we can better organize and coordinate their efforts with the goal of the state."
BAT_psychological_warfare:0 "Psychological Warfare"
BAT_psychological_warfare_desc:0 "All soldiers are susceptible to manipulation, even our own. While our propaganda will remind the Legions what they are fighting for, we shall invest heavily into our own efforts to undermine our enemy's will to fight. It is useless to resist the will of Nightmare Moon and we are her chosen ponies. If the pamphlets do not convince them, the speaker systems will."
BAT_chemical_warfare_corps:0 "The LMRD Chemical Department"
BAT_chemical_warfare_corps_desc:0 "A detachment of LMRD scientists will oversee the training of the first and all future members of the Legion's Chemical Corps. These soldiers will be specialized in utilizing advances in 'tactical use' chemicals such as gas, white phosphorus, and herbicides across all branches of our military while also acting to counter any use of chemical weapons by our enemy."
BAT_blow_them_out:0 "Destruction From Afar"
BAT_blow_them_out_desc:0 "Every life of a Legionnaire is sacred in the eyes of our great goddess. We cannot afford to spend them in her honor with wasteful assaults or risky maneuver tactics taken from heretical bugs. We instead will embrace a doctrine over overwhelming and superior firepower. It is our hope that once our artillery is done with a position that the infantry will simply have to sweep the enemy out of the crater."
BAT_legionary_operational_integrity:0 "Operational Integrity"
BAT_legionary_operational_integrity_desc:0 "Gone are the days when generals commanded nearly every aspect of a battle. Instead, our commanders will now pass on their plans and intent to subordinates. Those subordinates will do the same down the chain of command. At each level the officers will be able to pursue their own means to completing their respective objectives with disciplined intiative."
BAT_artillery_reliability:0 "Concentrated Fire"
BAT_artillery_reliability_desc:0 "The harder the fighting and the longer the war, the more the Legions leans on its gunners. Our artillery is the King of battle fit for our Holy Empress. We must ensure that the tools of our gunners are reliable as they are on the field of battle. Our Moonspeakers shall bless their shells and our ordnance shall rain the Nightmare's righteous fury from them."
BAT_mobile_warfare_conception:0 "The Batton Plan" #Yes I too want to die for this pun
BAT_mobile_warfare_conception_desc:0 "General Batton's insistence on a flexible, mobile army has lead to his personal development of a new doctrine for the Legions. Hoofcrafted, the 'Batton Plan' copies much from the Changeling school of warefare, but makes modifications that focus on the sustainability of maneuver warfare. If we were to fully commit to this plan, Batton insists our force could be entirely motorized in a matter of years."
BAT_develop_tank_models:0 "Adapt Stalliongradian Blueprints"
BAT_develop_tank_models_desc:0 "The godless heathens in Stalliongrad do not make the best tanks, but they are easy to manufacture and replace. They are also receptive to bribes and are more then willing to lose a few...examples. By adopting the Stalliongrad designs and doctrine, we will gain from the benefit their tanks offer; ease of manufacturing, utility, and numerical superiority."
BAT_develop_anti_tank:0 "The Stanchion"
BAT_develop_anti_tank_desc:0 "The Stanchion is a modern anti-tank rifle that gives its user the power of an anti-tank gun in the power of their hooves. Early trials are promising with live fire demonstrations coming in a matter of months. The ammunition the tank weapon uses can be altered as well depending on the range, target, or enviornment; all around a promising and unique weapon for our Legions' arsenals."
BAT_replacable_parts:0 "Material Standardisation"
BAT_replacable_parts_desc:0 "We adopted Stalliongradian tanks because of their easily replaceable parts, why not extend this idea to all of our military? By ensuring that reliability and ease of repair is uniform for all our materials, it will become easier to mantain our Legion's lethality during protracted conflicts."
BAT_heavier_tanks:0 "Breakthrough Tactics"
BAT_heavier_tanks_desc:0 "Our lighter tanks exceed our expectations with maneuverability, but they do not meet our needs to overcome deeply entrenched enemy positions. Sometimes one cannot simply drive around the enemy, therefore we must invest in developing a heavier model of tank that can drive through the enemy."
BAT_the_power_of_massed_assaults:0 "All the Little Ponies"
BAT_the_power_of_massed_assaults_desc:0 "The average machine gun fires hundreds of rounds per minute, but every enemy machine gun has a finite amount of ammo and a limited field of fire. With the blessings of the Nightmare, we cannot fail in overcoming this mortal obstacle. If it fires hundreds of rounds, we shall send thousands of ponies! We will crash upon our enemy like a wave in concentrated assaults!"
BAT_modern_assault_tactics:0 "Stormtrooper Tactics"
BAT_modern_assault_tactics_desc:0 "Those heretical Eyr worshippers on Griffonia and their meagre empire have developed an interesting infantry doctrine around 'Infiltration Tactics' and 'Stormtroopers'. By allowing small detatchments of our soldiers to survey and attack weakpoints in the enemy line, we can breakthrough where the enemy least expects us; just like the Stormtroopers of the Griffon Empire."
BAT_redemptionary_brigades:0 "Redemptionary Brigades"
BAT_redemptionary_brigades_desc:0 "Deserters, traitors, labourers, and any other dissidents who are willing to repent their sins shall be given the chance to find redemption through service in these special brigades. It might be cruel, but it is far more efficient to use them as a moving, fighting shield for our other units rather than simply execute them for their crimes."
BAT_combat_enhancers:0 "The LMRD Alchemical Department"
BAT_combat_enhancers_desc:0 "Methamphetamine hydrochloride when mixed with shamanistic poitions creates a potent combat enhancement that keeps soldiers alert without the risk of a crash after. We shall encourage our soldiers to consume these enhancements and monitor their effects. These enhancements will be distributed to units in laced gum, chocolates, and tablets for consumption."
BAT_steal_the_bits_gun:0 "The Bits Gun"
BAT_steal_the_bits_gun_desc:0 "Although the Bits gun might look strange and according to reports nearly impossible to carry comfortably, our wayward enemies in Equestria have created a reliable weapon suited for all types of environments. An internal compartment inside the reciever prevents the submachine gun from jamming even after dipped in mud or sand. Even its odd placement of the magazine holds a pragmatic purpose; we must have it for ourselves."
BAT_imperial_engineer_corps:0 "Her Imperial Majesty's Sappers"
BAT_imperial_engineer_corps_desc:0 "With the integration of Auxiliary units into combat roles, we can train our engineers to serve a greater purpose in combat. Taken from the Aquileian tradition, our sappers will act as our frontline combat engineers. No matter the danger, the obstacle, or the mission; our sappers will clear a path for our Empress' blessed Legions!"

BAT_the_commonwealth:0 "The Chiropterran Commonwealth"
BAT_the_commonwealth_desc:0 "To the victor, the spoils! We have achieved our goals! Our Second Great Conquest has crushed the armies of our enemies. No organized military, no singular nation that we opposed remains standing to fight us. We shall declare our Commonwealth of nations under the Chiropterran banner, for together we shall achieve the ultimate victory in the generations to come!"
BAT_exploit_subjects:0 "North Zebrican Resource Allocation Department"
BAT_exploit_subjects_desc:0 "As our borders have been greatly expanded in the wake of our victory, we must look to the just redistribution of North Zebrica's vast resosurces across the Commonwealth. The shambles of nation states that once held this territory were unable to use the bounty beneath them. It is our holy duty to the Nightmare, to allocate these new assets for the betterment of the Commonwealth as a whole."
BAT_cash_crop_profiliation:0 "Veteran Land Grants"
BAT_cash_crop_profiliation_desc:0 "The lands to the East can hardly be considered loyal territory yet. While we continue to debate what to do with its denizens, we can guarantee a perfectly loyal group by allocating significant portions of the territories to veteran plantations. Not only will this prove to be a boon to our economy, it will reward our former soldiers and plant true citizens of Chiropterra across the Commonwealth."
BAT_literally_boer_militias:0 "Legionary Settlement Defence Force"
BAT_literally_boer_militias_desc:0 "While our pacification brigades are an excellent tool in our arsenal for dealing with stubborn resistance, even our military cannot be everywhere at once. Among loyalists and veterans across the Commonwealth's new territories, we shall empower them to form defensive militias in their towns to combat insurgent forces. This will put much needed pressure onto rebel groups with little cost."
BAT_industrial_decommission:0 "Industrial Relocation Office"
BAT_industrial_decommission_desc:0 "The once...'prosperous' centers of industry in in Tobuck and Warzena were suited for their needs, not that of the Commonwealth. While many locals have protested the decision, it is only logical we relocate these assets where we see fit. These are no longer the factories of corrupt businessponies and warlords, but the means to a greater purpose under Nightmare Moon."
BAT_economic_cartelisation:0 "Economic Cartelisation"
BAT_economic_cartelisation_desc:0 "Our economy, while made to support our war efforts, must be adapted to allow us to accomplish our goals over a greater period of time. To do this, we will embrace the concept of 'Cartelisation' where state owned industries shall dominate their sector of specialization. This will let small businesses prosper while we bend the markets completely to us."
BAT_dealing_with_resistance:0 "Counter-Terrorism Operations"
BAT_dealing_with_resistance_desc:0 "Fighting a uniformed enemy is far easier than fighting a scattered insurgency, but there are many avenues open to us in this regard. The road ahead is dangerous though, failures in containing these threats do not only mean losses today; but losses for decades to come. An insurgency must be dealt with effectively and expediantely."
BAT_flying_arrow_doctrine:0 "The Flying Arrow Doctrine"
BAT_flying_arrow_doctrine_desc:0 "Although far more costly than looking for a fight, the Flying Arrow Doctrine requires a great network of blockhouses and outposts to restrict movement in designated areas. By denying the enemy the freedom of movement from these fixed positions, a mobile quick reaction force will engage any insurgents within these areas once they are spotted."
BAT_drop_squads:0 "Search And Destroy"
BAT_drop_squads_desc:0 "The obscene cost of building a network of overlapping fortifications is maddening! Therefore, we shall engage the enemy where we find them. While the enemy will retain much of their freedom of movement, anytime they congregate in meaningful numbers they will be crushed with overwhelming firepower."
BAT_interbranch_cooperation:0 "Interservice Cooperation"
BAT_interbranch_cooperation_desc:0 "While fighting an insurgency is much more layered than a conventional war, it does share its similarities. Clear lines of communication and integrated chains of command in areas of operation will enable a singular, shared approach as opposed to multiple disconnected efforts from different agencies and branches."
BAT_ban_collective_punishment:0 "Civilian Outreach Programs"
BAT_ban_collective_punishment_desc:0 "An insurgency will continue indefinetly if the civilian population does not one you there. While we cannot change hearts and minds overnight, nor cause further harm by isolating civilians in camps...we can reach out to them. By building roads, schools, and integrating ourselves into their lives peacefully we can turn them against the insurgency."

BAT_internment_camps:0 "Internment Camps"
BAT_internment_camps_desc:0 "In an insurgency it is impossible to tell a civilian from an insurgent, so we will no longer attempt to. By rounding up the locals into patrolled and regulated camps, we can let them go about their lives under our watchful eye as we eliminate anyone outside these camps. For if they're outside the camps, clearly they are the enemy."
BAT_special_zones:0 "Local Legionary Commissariats"
BAT_special_zones_desc:0 "A series of joint civilian-military commissariats shall be established in these zones of occupation to deepen our connection to these new territories with our government in Chiropterra.

She had returned though, Nightmare Moon had returned! Her mortal form may be weakened in Princess Luna, but it was a sign! Despite her weakened state, Chiropterra rejoiced for months at her rebirth; there was hope.\n\nFor seven years we have intensified our efforts and expanded our operations on Equus. We have strained already soured relations between Thestrals and Ponies, sabotaged efforts to modernize the Equestrian military even after the Changeling heretics captured Canterlot, and have embedded our assets across the Equestrian territories.\n\nOur ancestors arrived on Zebrica with spears and bows on rickety triremes bursting from the seam with their families. Our exile here, our removal from our homeland will be avenged! We will return to Equestria in massive ships armed with tanks and machine guns, each blessed by the moon herself!\n\nAnd if we fail?

The stallion did not struggle with the math, numbers were his strong suit. His old abacus just did not go high enough to account for the influx of new labourers enlightened in the last raid. Eternal was also not willing to use the new ‘slide ruler’ his grandson Lucent got him for his birthday.\n\nAllocating the labourers to their new professions based upon their old ones was hardly a trifling task either, but his equipment was slowing him down. It was rather ironic considering the stallion’s age. His mind was sharp as ever, but his body had slowed to a crawl. The ‘equipment’ he used to secure his spot on the Legion Council had worn thin.\n\nEven armed with a new tool, Eclipse wondered if it would even be enough.He never denied his feebleness now, the matters of the military were best left to younger soldiers like Lucent after all.\n\nHe was just letting his frustration get the best of him, he would try to learn the slide ruler once Lucent came to visit for their afternoon tea. Eternal consoled himself that he was still useful as he reassigned two thousand, nine hundred, and thirty-three new labourers to their assignments across the munitions plants. Their children would be turned over to the academies for training.\n\nHe hoped that Lucen would bring the mint tea, it always seemed to calm his nerves."

With the Storm King gone there was no reason not to expand to new spots!\n\nKinta wished he had listened to her.\n\nTheir ship had drifted too far while they were trawling for krill, he had been below when the raid happened. A dozen pegasi and thestrals landed on their deck, killed the captain, and rounded them all up in a matter of minutes. A unicorn was brought down and cast a strange spell, forcing them into a deep sleep.\n\nWhen Kinta woke up, he found himself in the Labourer’s quarters with the other captives. Some were killed trying to escape in the first week, another died from wounds after her flogging for interrupting a sermon to Nightmare Moon, and the last threw himself from the scaffolding down in the mines. Kinta was the last one from his ship after the first month. \n\nAnd he has been there ever since, working all day and into the night. They do not let him near any boats, his thestral overlords know that Kinta would try to run just as his companions had.

While undercover a few of his more charged reviews even made it into national papers for a great deal of praise, of course his handlers quickly put a stop to that growing fame.\n\n“It was a danger to the mission after all,  just like you,” he mused as he let the smoke roll from his nostrils before he turned to face his acquaintance for the night. The Equestrian agent was bound to a chair, bloodied and broken a dozen times over through their previous festivities. Whatever nonsense he tried to gargle past his broken teeth came out as incomprehensible slurs.\n\n“Save your strength, I am just enjoying a break myself,” Autumn chuckled out as he took a small sip from his wine. “I do want to congratulate you, my friend. In nearly thirty years of operations I’ve been involved with, I’ve never seen somepony come so very close to actually proving we exist.”\n\nThe agent choked out another gargle of bile and thrashed again his restraints, glaring past the one eye he had left.\n\n“I will take that as your modest appreciation for my kind words, but in any case,” Autumn added as he finished off his glass. “If you’re going to have to disappear, we’re going to have a bit more fun first; just me and you.”\n\nThe thestral slowly sauntered towards the record player, choosing a more modern Octavian piece as he took the burning ember of the cigar with his hoofs.

Ponies were hard to understand, prone to fits of emotion and irrational thought; even his own family was strained to care when he went on tirades about the numbers and mystical elements of crystals being harnessed for power..\n\nIt was in one of these impromptu speeches that Mystic first approached him, for the first time his grandstanding at a bar among his colleagues had a desirable outcome. She was perfect; she let him pick away at her mind, she picked away at his, and her love of physics was only rivaled by her attachment to him.\n\nIt was so easy with her, just like with math; being with her just added up.\n\nThe only downside was how much the mare traveled, but Bright could not bear to hold that against her. That was her job after all, even if it meant a visit to Zebrica every few months to ensure the relief organization she ran in Warzena was going well.\n\nMystic Belle was caring like that and Opal loved her all the more for it."

This is a weapon designed by a bunch, deranged godless heathens that Celestia let leave Equestria! They are exiles too and enemies of Equestria; but they have developed a weapon that surpasses our own!” the commander exclaimed as she swung the weapon around, ensuring everypony got a good look at it.\n\n“We are behind the curve, Legionnaires, and I am tired of hearing complaints from your commanders about there being a...reluctance among the ranks to adapt to the new weapons. Our breechloaders are not top of the line anymore, just like your father’s muskets, and like their grandfather’s swords!”\n\n“This rifle-” Lightning barked out as she held the SVETA above our head “-will be repurposed and learned, we will make it our own in time! But if I get any more reports about a legion dragging their heels in adapting to these new arms, I’m going to use them for target practice!”\n\n“Hold your officers accountable, hold yourselves accountable, and get it done!” she barked out as she slammed the butt of the rifle onto the stage. “Dismissed!”"

Most of the time the Legionnaire units trounced the Auxiliaries, but Gwedi led his engineers to three consecutive victories this year.\n\nNot that there was any real bad blood between the Auxiliaries and the Legions, all of that had been thawed out centuries ago. Legion might get the better equipment and the most dangerous missions, but there was no denying that the Auxiliaries had the most faith; and if Gwedi knew anything is that it was faith that got folks through the hard times.\n\nGwedi’s mother had been a labourer, but when she converted and gave birth to him; Gwedi himself became qualified for the Auxiliary. When he was old enough he sprung at the opportunity without hesitation; better rations for his mother and a chance to secure his children citizenship under the benevolent night? What more could a Zebra ask for?\n\nThe best part though of the Lunar Festival was the sermons. Gwedi never found himself proper in the temples for the goddess, but the sermons during the Festival were always around a dozen casks of the richest liquor they could find.\n\nWhen Lunar Hail stepped up onto an empty cask, Gwedi raised a healthy glass with every other soldier of Chiropterra following suit. The thestral priestess spoke with a fire and fury that would make even the most grizzled legionnaire blush. She promised an eternity in the night’s embrace for those that died righteously in battle, a divine heaven with enough warm beds and partners for every soul that fell in her service. Gwedi and all the auxiliaries hung on her words, in the thin moonlight and haze of the drink; Lunar Hail almost looked like Nightmare Moon herself!"

No pony is looking forward to the discussion of why the nearly thousand year old plan failed, but to avoid a conflict with no solutions; four proposals to reform the military are being presented.\n\nThe first proposal is from Lord Commander Palisade and Major General Air does not see any major changes to the doctrine, but rather the introduction of new technologies into the force. Their argument is that the planning for Moonshine was not flawed, just its execution. Therefore, the solution is to keep our modus operandi  in long term planning for advanced operations and simply improve upon our means of executing plans at a more effective rate.\n\nThe next proposal is from Lady Commander Lightning Charm and Lieutenant General Brine. They propose an extreme change to the use of support units and artillery in our doctrine, favoring overwhelming firepower and the full integration of Auxiliary units to support it. Their solution to most military problems is to engage the enemy with such great quantities of firepower that our foes cannot retaliate.\n\nLieutenant General Batton and Brigadier General Eclipse present the third and most radical plan to the council. Their heated debates are famous, but their vocal and passionate commitment to a doctrine that focuses on mobility is widely seen as the only thing they agree on. They believe that by motorizing our Legions and making the focus of our advance on armored units, that we can outmaneuver our adversaries and achieve decisive victories. \n\nLady Commander Lunar Hail is well known for her piety in the holy Empress and advocates for a doctrine that she claims favors the goddess. By amassing large waves of soldiers for coordinated assaults, she believes that we can overcome any obstacle. Some counter that these plans would waste valuable Legionnaires, but she proposes supplementing the Legions with ‘Redemptionary Brigades’."

He might not be a thestral or pegasus with their wings, nor a unicorn with their fancy magic.\n\nBut Coffee Hays knew his guns and this here, new model Luna Rifle was about the strangest thing a Legionnaire ever plopped down on his desk and told him to figure out. \n\nNightmare’s sake, the thing didn’t even fire bullets; just charged bursts from a crystal! It didn’t make a salt-lick of sense! How in the name of Tartarus did it even have recoil? There wasn’t any cartridge being ejected?\n\nThe stallion’s work on the weapon had taken weeks and a dozen different variants. Even when he copied the Luna Rifle part for part, it broke apart in his hooves. Either the weapon itself was shoddy or his work was, and the latter was near impossible. \n\nThings would change though! He finally figured out that by expanding the cooling ports along the barrel of the rifle, he could not only mitigate the recoil but allow the weapon to cycle through its crystal cartridges at a faster rate! It was a stroke of genius!\n\n“I just forgot the fact that if I didn’t account for the magical discharge when removing the magazine, I risked burning my flank something fierce...which I did,” Coffee Hays said with a shake of his head, sitting up a bit straighter as he offered a smile to the Legionnaire. “Rest assured though, I’ll get it next time.”\n\nFor if there was one thing Coffee Hays knew it was guns."

The intense and violent plot of “The Blood Mareidian” has gripped audiences all across our great nation!\n\nWhile local Legion officials have lauded the book for its portrayal of the savage nature of our godless neighbors, many academics have noted an almost subversive nature to many of the book's primary philosophies. The character of “Legionary Captain Holden” being a prime example of subtle denouncement of the nation’s policies towards the natives of Zebrica. In the novel he is portrayed as not personally believing in Nightmare Moon, but uses the faith of others to justify and encourage abhorrent crimes like scalp hunting.\n\nMcColty has denied any such intention and has encouraged readers to pull their own truths from the book. Many agree that the subtle critique of policy, exploration of theodicy, and faith makes the novel the magnum opus of McColty’s career!"

Although they have defended themselves by claiming that their “bold and decisive” actions prevented the raiding party from being overrun, the sheer lunacy of their solution had to be addressed.\n\nWhen asked to explain why they were playing music of all things during the attack, the officers claimed that it helped “calm” down their own troops in the fight while also scaring “the Tartarus” out of the enemy.

We would only ever need to ‘interact’ with anyone else when we were securing labourers. Countries, upon centuries of disappearances compounded fewer and fewer souls are willing to come near us to investigate; further securing our isolation. \n\nThis system worked when battles were won with blood and iron, when feudal lords and their false gods ruled.\n\nIt does not work in a world of global trade, in a world of rapid technological advancement, and shared thought. We see the writing on the walls; radios, cars, and even the fringe rumors of crystal fusion. In a world that is constantly more connected by advancement and technology…\n\n...we cannot remain hidden forever.\n\nWe must make radical changes to our economy, the status quo can no longer sustain our great purpose!

A recent report from the weapon’s development and research team has requested a formal renaming of the weapon when it enters production to be “Lancer” though.\n\nThe team’s reasoning is in “honour” of one of the Legion’s officers assigned to the live firing tests, Captain Moonlight Lancer. Captain Lancer was tasked with testing the weapon’s capabilities from a higher vantage point. The thestral followed all orders to a letter and decided that the best vantage point was in flight over the target.\n\nIt is hard to describe the surprise of the team when Captain Lancer fired the Stanchion prototype without even supporting it against a passing cloud. Suffice to say, the recoil broke the officer’s shoulder and the fall shattered one of his wings. \n\nAlthough the lesson was invaluable to the development team and proved their theories on the weapon’s recoil in flight to be correct, they wish to formally commemorate the officer that led them to these conclusions. Captain Lancer has taken this all in good faith and has made it clear that he welcomes the distinction of being; “the first of many to be put on their flank by this unholy thing.”"

Lord Commander Palisade was thorough, energetic, and utterly dry.\n\nBy hour one and point number eleven he had lost most of the Legionary Council. Those that had aides on had excused themselves quietly and allowed the Junior Officers to take notes for them while they stepped out to continue their work.\n\nBy hour two and point twenty-two, most of the young officers and the few unfortunate Council members who came alone were discreetly asleep or beyond paying attention. Palisade’s analysis of past Legion logistic networks that led to the creation of Chiropterra’s poppy fields overwhelmed them, clearly.\n\nThe meeting ended eventually when the recorder passed out behind his typewriter and ruined much of the information that had been recorded.

Ecliptic Brine was on the frontlines of trying to change the doctrine of all the Legions to something more focused on superior firepower, but she herself could not stand to be around howitzers for more than a few minutes.\n\nShe spent several tours researching their effectiveness in the field, but that meant her hearing had gone away faster as if the mare was twice her age. The NCO’s apologies to her gradually became more audible as the sharp whine began to pop and squirm back into audible noise. “...and I offer both my hooves as collateral, ma’am!”\n\nThe dull ringing sound hung in her ears as Brine waved a hoof dismissively to the NCO, silently forgiving him of firing the gun while she had been so close. Ecliptic did not hold it personally against the artillerypony, it had been her own damn fault for not wearing her ear protection.

That’ll cost ponies their lives, General!” \n\n“Their lives? They’re soldiers, that’s what they do! Those red bastards might be backwards savages, but they got the right idea. Our tanks need to be mass produced and our tanks need to be modular! We have to be able to repair them in the field, at a motorpool; not ship them back to the factory!” Batton hissed as he opened the folder.

I don’t care how large the caliber of the gun is, if it takes up too much fuel and can’t easily be repaired, how in the Nightmare's sacred name am I supposed to maneuver with that?”\n\n“The Changeling engineers are some of the best in the world, despite their heresy. Quality over quantity, General Batton. That is how we will win the next war,” Eclipse groaned as he sat back down in his chair. \n\n“We won’t win a single war if my tanks break down every ten miles!

Concerns with ‘health’ and ‘safety’ for our allotted test subjects clogging the wheels of progress for an unnecessary amount of time.

He stands nearly a head and half above most in the Legion and has out performed every other candidate in the physical trials. While I found his physical appearance to be pleasingly symmetrical, a hallmark of good genes, his mind was not as sharp as others that were considered. I am almost embarrassed to admit I hesitated, but it only took a moment to remind myself of Project Noctule’s goal; a supersoldier.\n\nUpon further review of his record, several of his former superiors have reported a ‘cruelty’ towards the enemy. Some have noted that he does not seem to ‘care’ about others, only about the next fight. I will admit it is a shame that Comet Flash was not a smarter stallion, he would have found the LMRD to be quite hospitable to his needs.\n\nAll things considered, Comet Flash has the best chance to physically endure the chemicals that have been prepared for the treatments.

He theorized in his notes replacing the subject’s organs, but such a costly endeavour defeats the purpose of Project Oaxaca; the ability to quickly increase magical power.\n\nHeart surgery cannot be considered ‘quick’ in any sense.\n\nThe research teams continue to dilute the crystal extract with depressants in the hope that a slowed heart rate will alleviate the continued issue of volatile organ failure.

Timberwolves proved too difficult to extract from the Everfree forest and the team sent to try capturing an Ursa Major never returned. Cockatrices have already proved their difficulty with their humiliation of New Mareland’s military and were not considered.

The resulting suicides were a waste of valuable resources and the driving factor for our new security measures. \n\nTheir unfortunate loss has been beneficial in allowing me to force the Council’s hoof in acquiring Hippogriff test subjects.

There has been no physical breakdown, only increased muscular hypertrophy and bone density to accommodate for its increasing size.\n\nWhile Comet Flash once stood nearly a head taller than I, it is projected he will be twice my height by the time his regimen is completed. He has exceeded each athletic test and physical feat the team has placed before him. We have managed to avoid sedation by allowing plenty of rest, relaxation, and increased rations for him. He said rather simply; ‘treat him right, get treated right.’\n\nSimplicity is a characteristic that I admire in Comet. His simplicity is also constant; the stallion was not bright before the injections and he has not displayed any increased intelligence after them. Thankfully, there has been no visible mental degradation either. One of the researchers however came to me with a theory after we finished testing the subject today.\n\nAccording to her, we are witnessing mental stagnation rather than degradation. As the subject’s size increases and his brain warps subtly to respond to these changes, his already lacking mental capacity is ‘capping off’.

To do this, I understand that we cannot rely on parlor tricks or flawed magic. We must look to what the LMRD knows best; science.

Upon mixing copious amounts of morphine into the crystal substance, the team has been able to stabilize the initial effect of Project Oaxaca to its intended effect. \n\nWithout the sudden discharge of gore prevalent in all other tests, I have a subdued hope in the success of the project.

It has been a costly endeavor, in regards to life and coin, to retrieve a viable population. The first report detailing the cost nearly gave Baron Breeze a stroke. I concede, however, the look on his face has been more than worth the price overall.\n\nWith a sustainable breeding population we can begin to experiment with the most receptive subjects on methods of control. Initial tests with different collars were less than fruitful. The multiple bindings made the creature docile, but rendered it too calm. When each head of the Hydra is bent to our will it loses its savage nature.\n\nThere is a suspicion among some of the researchers of a ‘dominant’ head. Similar to how pack animals behave, if the alpha is brought under our control the rest will fall in line.

Rather than any trait carried by a species in its DNA that made its regenerative process special, as we incorrectly theorized with Hippogriffs, it was discovered that a rare bacteria aided in rapid healing. \n\nThe bacteria acts similar to healing magic by boosting the speed of the natural healing process. While our soldiers will not be regenerating limbs or preventing excessive scarring, when mixed with crystal extract and other chemicals the rapid stimulation injection pack can close almost all wounds.\n\nThese ‘Stimpaks’ as the team has called them have been put to use on several laborers in varying levels of injury.

While the Hydra itself grows to maturity rather quickly, the process of carrying the eggs to hatch is a long and complicated one. The size of the creatures and their danger do not allow us to mass produce the creatures in our current territory, meaning that there is a reasonable limit to how many Hydra we could bring into our forces.\n\nThe second issue is the logistics of maintaining the Hydra. Although we have figured out how to control them by collaring the alpha head, each one still requires nearly three platoons to handle the creature's daily maintenance in combat conditions. The amount of resources that would go into each Hydra brigade could easily fund several armored divisions.\n\nAt the end of the day, the LMRD has delivered once more to the Council its monster, even if the brigade leading it insists on it being called ‘Mister Cuddlesworth.’"

Kinta recognized some of the Labourers\n\nThey were Labourers who refused to fall in line and they all wore iron collars around their necks.\n\nThe officer gestured to him to stand and Kinta weakly rose to his hooves. An overseer roughly snapped a metal collar around his neck. The collar cut into his neck as Kinta swallowed and looked around slowly.

He scanned the crowd for the youngest soul he could find, someone who had a full life to live ahead of them. A mare stood out among all the others.

The tiny crackle of a moonspeaker delivering a morning sermon caused the Zebra to laugh for the first time since he had been forced to Chiropterra.\n\nHis new living quarters were similar to all the living quarters that the Labourers had now. It was a simple, small, three room apartment furnished with all the modern amenities he had only heard whispers about from the traders in his village; ovens, running water, electricity, radio, appliances...it was overwhelming.\n\nHe wondered if he was even bondage anymore.

Her smile was warm and her voice soft, with an unfamiliar twang that hooked his attention, “Overwhelmed?”\n\n“Yes...it is…” Kinta looked around the hallway, confirming it was empty before lowering his voice to her. “Strange.”\n\n“Strange?” the mare asked with an arch of her brow.

While our ranches across Chiropterra are known for their cray-sea prices and quality product, have you ever thought of getting your youngsters a new aqua-intance of their own?”\n\n“Our new batch of mini-coconut crabs have been bred to be one-hundred percent docile around equines of all types. With almost no crab related fatalities this year, now isn’t the time to be shellfish and deny your favorite filly the friend of their dreams!”\n\n“In a pinch? Other ranches got your finances in hot water? Our customers are our most shrimportant part of our family and we’ll never treat you like a prawn like some other ranches. We promise not to put you through shell and feeling crabby afterwards!”\n\n“The first two hundred customers to pick up their new best friend will receive a year’s worth of our signature ‘crab-chow’ and a military-grade leash so you can take your new best buddy wherever you want to go! This isn’t a deal to miss fillies and gentlecolts, you’ve only got a few days before you have to wait a whole year to get a chance at it!”"

bat.55.t:0 "An Evening At The Clan Reed Plantation"
bat.55.d:0 "Auburn Leaf casually made her way through the crowds of Chiropterra’s most esteemed and wealthy aristocracy as the gentle rise and fall of classical music filled the halls of Clan Reed’s plantation home. She settled by the window for a time, looking out into the faint outline of the tobacco fields in the soft moonlight. Something was...different, different in the air and the incessant chatter of elderly nobility.\n\n“I know that look, Lady Leaves.” Lucent Eclipse poked through the mingling horde of wealth and power to bother her. The stallion offered her a glass as he sipped from his own. “You scrunch your nose when you’re onto something.” \n\n“Rather bold of you, Brigadier General Eclipse,” the mare mused over the rim of her drink as she took it from him. “Operation Moonshine failed. The Council has to keep the old blood in line for another thousand years need be, but do you notice it?”\n\n“I lack your perception, Auburn,” Lucent replied with a shake of his head. The thestral was many things and sharp was never his forte. He made up for it with his heart, but having a heart was a hard thing in Chiropterra. \n\n“The relief, can’t you feel it? No riots, no great wave of change...everypony in this room is comfortable with Moonshine failing because it means the burden is off their shoulders,” Auburn explained. “They might not be happy it failed, but do not deny you haven’t noticed the smiles. They’re all content that they’ve done their part, ensuring the success of the next generation.”\n\n“The next generation...” Lucent said as he scanned around the room slowly. “You notice anyone here our age? The band is about to play a rather nice song and I’m afraid if I ask anypony else to dance I’ll break their hip.”\n\nAuburn looked across the crowd of ponies packed into the ballroom hall of the estate. Young Labourers and servers walked by with drinks while junior officers stood guard in doorways and on balconies. The aristocracy, gray and wrinkled, danced the night away. They sent off Operation Moonshine with fine wine and hushed promises, each member of the Council celebrating its end. Even the virile General Batton leaned against some poor labourer mare whispering something that was probably crude or maniacal in her ear, but no amount of inebriation could hide the stallion’s grey mane.\n\n“You’re sharper than you used to be, Lucent,” the mare finally said as she set the empty glass on the windowsill. She lifted her hoof to take his and slowly guide them towards the music. “Your subtlety could use some work. They still control the waves of change and you need to be patient.”\n\n“Patience is a virtue that I still truly lack,” he mused as they began the slow waltz, gliding across the ballroom. “We have reason to introduce reform now, meaningful change for everypony. A chance at a better Chiropterra. Why let them solely control the coming change?”\n\n“Because it is easier to ride a wave than fight against it,” Auburn said with a shake of her head. “Let their last triumph be a sweeping reform of our nation. Whatever comes next, we will simply have to make do with what they leave us...now stop stepping on my hooves and let a lady lead.”"

BAT_AUTUMN_BREEZE_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 31st of December, 951 in New Ayacachtli\n\n§YRank§!: Lord Commander Of The Nightmare Legion\n\n§YBiography§!: Baron Autumn Breeze III, one of the last scions of the venerable Clan Reed of Fillydelphia, whom a millenia ago were one of the first Equestrian noble families to recognize the righteousness of her Imperial Majesty Nightmare Moon's Rebellion, and although the first rebellion was a catastrophic failure Clan Reed never betrayed their Empress and as such were the first of her Majesty's loyal subjects to set off for the savage lands of Zebrica, and it was they who laid the foundations for the creation of Chiropterra those countless centuries ago.\n\nSince those dark days Clan Reed and by extension the Nightmare Legion they have been charged with leading have laid in the shadows; Slowly but surely laying the seeds of doubt that will one day lead to the return of the Empress and the destruction of Equestria."
