Inside was a pony identified as a crew member of the SS Sunny Hauler. He was highly agitated and lashed out at his rescuers. Eventually, they calmed down enough to recount their chilling tell.\n\nIt turns out that the SS Sunny Hauler had found themselves trapped in thick though at night, in the middle of the ocean. From their his account turned into one of incoherent ramblings about “something in the water” and “the sweetest music ever heard”. Eventually, the crew of the ship turned their crewmates and brutally fought each other to the death.\n\nThe crewpony found themselves thrown overboard, adrift in the lifeboat. It was there they witnessed the something they could only describe as “them” rise from the waves to feast on what remained below dragging the ship belove the sea. When as for more they could only answer with, “they have returned.”"
