### Focuses ###
JUN_decleration:0 "Stuck in a Strange Land"
JUN_decleration_desc:0 "Due to unforeseen circumstances it seems that we are in fact stuck running a country, in the middle of a jungle filled with dangerous fauna, flora, tribals, crazy cultists and annoying adventurers... but if we play our cards right perhaps we can still turn a profit here."
JUN_we_need_a_port:0 "Repurpose Saltmane"
JUN_we_need_a_port_desc:0 "Saltmane Coast is a splendid territory, but we require more than simple jungles and beaches for our war efforts. We shall turn this area into our primary port, to protect ourselves from sea threats as well."
JUN_we_need_the_guns:0 "Call In A Few Favours"
JUN_we_need_the_guns_desc:0 "The instability we face is not one to be taken lightly. Our assets are low, our stance, feeble. However, it will soon change. The means of combat is a small favour to ask in order to achieve control. There's no profit to be made if we can't even defend ourselves."
JUN_we_need_even_more:0 "And Then Some"
JUN_we_need_even_more_desc:0 "The dangers are always afoot, if we intend to stand a chance, more weapons are required. It's time we further increase our stockpile of armaments. Guns, grenades, ammunition, anything a soldier can need."
JUN_the_wealth_of_the_jungle:0 "The Riches of Aztlan"
JUN_the_wealth_of_the_jungle_desc:0 "This land is rich with goods and treasures, we need only be able to excavate them. I, Caballeron, demand quarries to be developed, lands will be razed and trees to be cut, the resources are everywhere, and they will be ours."
JUN_dedicated_smugglers:0 "Blockade Runners"
JUN_dedicated_smugglers_desc:0 "They think they can contain us in here, limit our income. This territory is ours now, and we'll use it to our advantage. Let's show them who controls these jungles, and who can smuggle through them better."
JUN_fortify_technochitlan:0 "Rebuild The Walls Of Tenochtitlan"
JUN_fortify_technochitlan_desc:0 "Tenochtitlan was once a fortress, an impenetrable bastion with great walls which none could surmount. We must rebuild them, that will provide us with a strategic standpoint and a defensive position, should such need arise. And perhaps, the locals will feel more accepting of our presence here."
JUN_reuse_the_ruins:0 "Repurpose the Ruins"
JUN_reuse_the_ruins_desc:0 "The Ruins here are old, crumbling, but they can still provide a solid foundation. We shall repurpose them for our own needs, build our structures upon the ancient land, there will be a stronghold raised here in no time, such is my will."
JUN_repair_the_cannals:0 "Repair The Canals"
JUN_repair_the_cannals_desc:0 "Rivers are a fickle landmark, wild and unpredictable, but if we can tame it, it will become our advantage. Repair the old canals, so that the water will provide us with resources, the river will become our line of transport and the shores will be our enemies' nightmare."
JUN_food_surplus:0 "Stock The Pantries"
JUN_food_surplus_desc:0 "Our supplies come steadily and surely, it is time to replenish our stocks. Load the pantries, let none of our supplies perish, or worse, get into our enemies' clutches. There will always be a good use for it later, our ponies will need it."
JUN_the_old_road:0 "Repair The Ohtli System"
JUN_the_old_road_desc:0 "So many things in here are still in half-decent state. They may not be of good use right now, but if we are to invest into renovations of these roads and structures, our infrastructure will flourish, just as these jungles do."
JUN_secondary_forts:0 "Raise The Towers"
JUN_secondary_forts_desc:0 "With all the elements I put in place, we're still exposed and scattered among these woods. Raise the towers! Our sight will span far and wide, none shall take us by surprise! These fortified constructions will bestow upon us a gratifying sense of security."
JUN_repair_the_temple:0 "Repair the Tonaltzintli Pyramid"
JUN_repair_the_temple_desc:0 "The culture and architecture of these locals is fascinating, the Tonaltzintli Pyramid is a prime example of an excellent edifice of the Neighua tribe. Though turned to a decrepit state with time, this temple may return to its former glory yet. May it inspire us well and provide refuge from the raging war. My only hope is that the chiefs can share my enthusiasm."
JUN_basic_manufacturies:0 "Tenochtitlan Manufacturies"
JUN_basic_manufacturies_desc:0 "With all the progress I've made to develop the framework here, the time has come to move to the next level. Our capital requires better factories, better production. We can finally set up a progressive manufacturing base here, the likes of which this land has not yet seen before."
JUN_basic_saw_mills:0 "Logging Camps"
JUN_basic_saw_mills_desc:0 "The jungles have no shortage of wood. Yet to harvest it more effectively, we need better tools and groundwork to support such activities. Build more sawmills, our logging camps will yield materials to the brim, we shall never run out of fine wood again."
JUN_win_them_over:0 "Meet With The Natives"
JUN_win_them_over_desc:0 "Perhaps these locals can be of use to us. After all, they're the natives here, it would be foolish to fight against them and not alongside them. We must organise a meeting, I know a way into their heart, there is a chance that they will listen to me."
JUN_hearts_and_minds:0 "Hearts And Minds"
JUN_hearts_and_minds_desc:0 "We must further our relationship with the Neighua. A fight for survival can unite anyone, and this is our chance. They may be dangerous, but if we sway them to our side, our cause, the dangers they present can become our tactical advantage."
JUN_borne_of_the_jungle:0 "Borne Of The Dark"
JUN_borne_of_the_jungle_desc:0 "With our agreements in place, our newfound allies entrusted us some of their best and most trained warriors. It is a great honour, and an opportunity that we must cherish. I welcome them, our partners will thrive, and our enemies will learn to fear these jungles."
JUN_bury_them_here:0 "Masters Of The Jungle"
JUN_bury_them_here_desc:0 "Our partnership allowed us to learn these territories in their greatest details. Every nook and cranny that these locals have lived among for ages, their secrets, are now part of our intelligence. Ultimately, it seems this ally has become our greatest asset yet."
JUN_the_chosen:0 "Chosen By The Gods"
JUN_the_chosen_desc:0 "Their culture is a curious one. Odd, but has its uses, perhaps I underestimated them. They wish to offer us to be chosen by the Gods. Such tales are quaint, but the ferocity and cunning of these ponies is undeniable. We shall take them on their offer, it is bound to help our relationship in the future."
JUN_the_final_push:0 "Fight For Aztlan"
JUN_the_final_push_desc:0 "After all we've gone through, I never gave up, we never gave up, and never will. These jungles were a dangerous place, full of perils on every step. They still are, but thanks to our allies, it is only our enemies that see them as such. The Neighua and their culture, their knowledge, is part of our own now. We are free, and this is our land now, we will fight for it as if it were our own. Now, we are home. For Aztlan!"

JUN_aztlan_airforce:0 "The Aztlan Airforce"
JUN_aztlan_airforce_desc:0 "When the Aztlanians used to look up in the sky, they would see nothing but Equestrian pegasi, Equestrian planes or the dreaded dragons. If we are to safeguard our independence and control over the jungles, we’ll need to build an airforce."
JUN_import_fighters:0 "Import Fighter Craft"
JUN_import_fighters_desc:0 "Aztlan as it stands doesn’t have much in terms of planes in its airfield. If we are to dominate our own sky, we won’t do it with repurposed civilian planes and repaired downed equestrian planes. We can acquire some planes from various sellers in Griffonia to kickstart our airforce."
JUN_light_aircraft:0 "The Quetzalcoatl"
JUN_light_aircraft_desc:0 "Ever since creatures have conquered the sky without magic or their own wings, the ponies of Aztlan only got to see others watching others flying. Worse, Aztlan has long been a place for foreign or Equestrian aerobats to show off their skills. However, through creativity and determination, one of our engineer has put together plans for an entirely Aztlanian fighter plane. He has called it the Quetzacoatl, in honor of our tradition."
JUN_CAS_f:0 "The Cuitlatlotli"
JUN_CAS_f_desc:0 "Warfare in the Southeast has been mostly land-based, with planes fighting an almost unrelated form of combat. But many of our pilots have proven to be anxious to help our soldiers on the ground. So much so that our military court is swamped with disciplinary hearings over dangerous low-altitude actions. Tired of punishing our pilots for what we should recognize as acts of bravery, our military staff has decided to put them to use with specialized airplanes."
JUN_import_bombers:0 "Import Bomber Craft"
JUN_import_bombers_desc:0 "Using our planes to prevent hostile bombers from wrecking our forces and infrastructure is a desirable goal but it leaves so much potential unexplored. Through contacts in Sicameon, we have found opportunities to import our very own bombers. It’s time that we are able to turn tables on our enemies."
JUN_bomber_aircraft:0 "The Cuauhtli"
JUN_bomber_aircraft_desc:0 "Importing Bombers has allowed us to bolster our airforce but it is a costly and unreliable source. Our engineer have studied the model and through some retro engineering, they have come up with a new model, one that can be built locally at a much cheaper cost."
JUN_heavier_bombers:0 "The Tepopoloani"
JUN_heavier_bombers_desc:0 "Tactical bombing is all well and good but our engineers have pushed forward a new concept, one that is revolutionizing warfare throughout the world : long-range bombing. No more will war in the Southeast be a distant affair read about in the ninth page of the newspaper for our bombers will bring war to our enemies’ home."
JUN_build_the_airstrips:0 "Construct the Airstrips"
JUN_build_the_airstrips_desc:0 "One of the most significant issue we are still facing today is the lack of airfields in Aztlan. The old airstrips on the coast have served their purpose but they are not enough. Our pilots still dread any issue when flying over our own jungle heartland. We need to take steps so our cities are connected to our airways."
JUN_train_the_pilots:0 "Train The Pilots"
JUN_train_the_pilots_desc:0 "Our airforce has seen significant improvement since we have established it. However, our pilot corps still leaves to be desired. Even by the kindest terms, it remains a ragtag bunch of adventurers, Equestrian defectors, mercenaries and some self-taught heroes of the independence war. While they are definitely worthy of praise for their enthusiasm and romantic charm, we can’t expect to rely on them much longer. It is time to establish a standardized training program for our recruits and to create a proper air academy."
JUN_heavier_fighters:0 "The Tepoz Cuauhtli"
JUN_heavier_fighters_desc:0 "Even with our investments in airfields, the Southeast remains a difficult place to fly over. Many a good pilot has been lost to the jungle or mechanical failure due to exhausted engines. As much as we can push our sturdy Quetzacoatls, there are many missions these planes are simply unsuited for. Our military staff and engineers have issued a plane for a new kind of heavy fighter : the Tepoz Cuauhtli. With it, they say, true air superiority is achievable."
JUN_night_fliers:0 "Night Fliers"
JUN_night_fliers_desc:0 "Since times immemorial, Aztlanians have known the value of hunting in the night. Let us put that martial tradition to use in the air! May our enemies experience the terrors of the night in Aztlan..."
JUN_expert_fliers:0 "Children Of Quetzalcoatl"
JUN_expert_fliers_desc:0 "”Look up in the sky! It’s a bird! It’s a plane! It IS a plane! And that plane belongs to the Aztlan Airforce!”"

JUN_aztlan_navy:0 "The Aztlan Navy"
JUN_aztlan_navy_desc:0 "For centuries, Aztlan has been denied free access to the sea but now that we are free from Equestrian imperialism, we may begin to work on a navy and truly open ourselves to the world."
JUN_baltimare_port:0 "The Baltimare Dockyards"
JUN_baltimare_port_desc:0 "The dockyards in Baltimare have been one of the most important ones in the southeast. Sadly, they have been badly damaged when we wrestled control over the city from the revolutionaries. With some repairs, this symbol of equestrian naval power may become one for Aztlan."
JUN_stableside_port:0 "The Stableside Dockyards"
JUN_stableside_port_desc:0 "Stableside is one of the few cities in the Southeast that has an actual industrial capacity, and the only coastal one at that. As such, it is home to many civilian dockyards but with some investment from our part, we could transform it into a major military harbour. Without those investments, the dream of an Aztlanian navy will remain just that."
JUN_destroyer_f:0 "The Aztlan Coast Guard"
JUN_destroyer_f_desc:0 "Equus’ southeastern coast is a dangerous place. Pirates and privateers are no rarity and dragons flying over from their isles often cause chaos in naval activities. Establishing a Coast Guard will allow us to begin establishing some order."
JUN_light_cruiser_f:0 "Heavier Plating"
JUN_light_cruiser_f_desc:0 "Small destroyers and repurposed civilian ships will only take us so far in creating a navy. We need to invest in cruisers able to withstand prolonged combat. At first, we may use them as command ships for our coastal fleets but in the years to come, they will be a significant asset to support our larger ships."
JUN_saltmane_port:0 "The Saltmane Dockyards"
JUN_saltmane_port_desc:0 "Baltimare and Stableside are serving their purpose as naval bases but their position on our periphery is hurting our naval capabilities. Meanwhile, our strategically placed coastal city of Saltmane is severely lacking in naval infrastructure. By aggressively investing there, we can finally link up our northern and southwestern navies and facilitate communication between our naval staff and Tenochtitlan."
JUN_submarine_f:0 "The Hidden Navy"
JUN_submarine_f_desc:0 "Even with heavy investments, it will take a long time for Aztlan to have a navy capable of withstanding direct contact. However, we are no stranger to asymmetrical warfare and fighting stronger forces. Let us take into account the lessons of our land warfare history and apply them to our naval plans. Our submarines shall lurk under the sea until we are ready for more orthodox forms of naval combat."
JUN_heavy_cruiser_f:0 "Light Battleships"
JUN_heavy_cruiser_f_desc:0 "Our dockyards have proven to be surprisingly adaptable to our growing demands on building and maintaining warships. The reports on our cruiser experiments have demonstrated that they are ready for heavier experiments. As a result, our naval engineers have put forward a plan to create a light battleship, the first one to be named the [JUN.GetLeader]"
JUN_doctrianl_development:0 "Doctrinal Development"
JUN_doctrianl_development_desc:0 "Despite our progress, our military staff is still a mess composed of Equestrian defectors and foreign adventurers. As a result, our navy functions without a proper doctrine. We need to sort out the doctrinal debate and fix ourselves some objectives about where we wish to take our navy. Aztlan’s independence may very well depend on it."
JUN_battleship_f:0 "The War Navy"
JUN_battleship_f_desc:0 "With our navy beginning to take to the seas and our sailors becoming more experimented, the days of smaller objectives are now behind us. Aztlan is a small power still but the seas are merciless. If we are to exist as a naval nation, we need a true war navy. One that will be lead by true fortresses of the seas. It will be a difficult and long endeavour but if we do not take steps towards this end now, Aztlan shall never be safe, let alone powerful on the world stage."
JUN_carrier_f:0 "Carrier Experiments"
JUN_carrier_f_desc:0 "Anypony sailing in the Southeast has already witnessed a dragon flying over. This has lead many of our naval officers to understand the potential and power of air power applied to naval warfare whereas many naval staff throughout the world still hold doubts about it. This has lead to many early designs for carrier ships, most of which were utterly unattainable for our meager naval capabilities. With our newly acquired experience and infrastructure, we may at last work on them."
JUN_new_admirality:0 "The Aztlan Admiralty"
JUN_new_admirality_desc:0 "With the incredible progress achieved by our fledgling navy, it is time for us to finally establish it as an independent branch of our military forces. Gone are the days our naval operations were haphazardly directed from Tenochtitlan. An independent Admiralty will be set up in their own new headquarters in the modernized port of Saltmane. From there, our admirals shall work tirelessly to make sure that one day Aztlan will rule the waves."

### Events ###
jungle.1.t:0 "The Paramount Chiefs"
jungle.1.d:0 "One is never sure what to expect when they meet the local tribes whose lands you come into. I studied them, but I can't be ready for everything. Will they be savage? Will they ambush us? Will they want to work together with us? Though, it still gives me hope that they agreed to this meeting. We're not in the best position to bargain right now.\n\nYet still, despite all the possible issues, the chiefs were friendly to us. Perhaps, they appreciate the respect I tried to show for their culture, or they simply realise that the war closing in around us can threaten their peace as well as their stability, or even their well-being. The summit was a success, and they will aid us find our place in these jungles, while we will offer them protection.\n\nWhile their strings were easy to pull, they made themselves clear, they will cooperate, on the condition that we respect their customs, their tradition and their culture. A small price to pay for the shelter of an ancient and powerful ally who know the landscape better than any one us ever will."
jungle.1.a:0 "I'm glad we are working together"

jungle.2.t:0 "Hearts And Minds"
jungle.2.d:0 "It seems that both of us came to the same conclusion, a misfortune united us, but it is I who will turn it into our fortune. Same as us, they see the great benefit of our cooperation, we provide them with a barrier, better infrastructure and the possibility to rebuild their long lost greatness, the structures that were beaten and eroded with time, the harsh jungle weather and the previous occupants. While on their end, they give is insight on the landscape, the safe paths, the dangerous glades and even some hidden treasures.\n\nIt was an underestimation from my side, what they're capable of. A frail mistake, to doubt them, but that doesn't matter now, for our hearts and minds are focused on the same purpose, survival.\n\nWe shall see how our mutual future will turn out, but for now, this alliance proves itself to be a promising treat."
jungle.2.a:0 "Aztlan shall be free!"

jungle.3.t:0 "Conflicts of Interest"
jungle.3.d:0 "It appears that our local friends are not too happy with the recent expansion of our logging efforts. Soon after the new mills started toppling the glades and piling the wood, the chiefs called us for an emergency meeting.\n\nThey were adamant about the value of land for them, the resources it provided, a relationship that should not be overstepped. They looked at me with a lightning glare, but their dissatisfaction still finished with only puffs and grunts, as they did not take any major actions about it.\n\nWhile resources are required, I did not want to show signs of weakness. Neighua do not like weakness, that I know well. However, we can only hope that they do understand the purpose of our actions, the enormous war effort that we carry, and forgive us for it. I may be harsh, but I think I was too harsh this time. Hm, I shall yet rebuild their jungle sweep and wide."
jungle.3.a:0 "Rather unfortunate"

jungle.4.t:0 "Squatter Troubles"
jungle.4.d:0 "Our continued effort to gather more resources has attracted new interest to our territories. Not all of it, however, I can call positive and useful. A problem arose out of it, the squatters started taking up more and more of our space.\n\nOne can only wonder where do they even come from, but riches, or even better, commodities, do appear to have that effect. The surrounding areas of our pantries is more like slums for poor and adventurers alike now. They don't seem to have the intention to leave, either.\n\nThough I need to focus on my own kind first, this pest do not seem to be all that harmful, other than to our supplies and reputation, yet we cannot ignore them.\n\nThere is strength in numbers, we have enough resources, I'll find a use for these lackeys. Unlike the sun, the work never sets at the horizon, there's always more of it. If they wish to stay, they will stay, but first they'll earn their bread."
jungle.4.a:0 "At least we can put them to work..."

jungle.5.t:0 "The Wonders of Irrigation"
jungle.5.d:0 "Oh, water, a crucial resource for any civilisation, and these jungles are abundant with it. From humidity to rivers, sometimes I wish there was less of it. But by taming the flow of the river, we can utilise it to suit our every need.\n\nOur fields bloom, our citizens thrive, all thanks to the improved infrastructure. Truly a display of our power and a victory for our well-being. The influence we exert on this realm only grows.\n\nAhh, the wonders of irrigation. "
jungle.5.a:0 "Ain't it beautiful?"

jungle.6.t:0 "An Amazing Discovery"
jungle.6.d:0 "Restoring the old ruins was no easy task, I knew that myself. The stones, old, crude, uneven, are hard to work with. I feared that this whole operation will be more woeful than it would be profitable.\n\nUntil, one day, we hit upon a secret chamber in one of the ruins' catacombs compartments. It was filled with riches beyond my imagination, and this time, no pesky adventurers to stop me from claiming what is mine. The locals were right when they told us to investigate this place. I can only wonder if perhaps, they wanted us to find these? Nevertheless, the discovery raised the spirits of the ponies, and it seemed as if all the previous inconveniences simply vanished and the work continued without a hitch.\n\nWith all the new structures in place, and the fresh treasures in our vaults, this province starts looking all the more promising to me."
jungle.6.a:0 "Gold, gems, and more!"

jungle.7.t:0 "Native Complaints"
jungle.7.d:0 "The war is looming on us all, and we are in no way having an advantageous predicament in it yet. The fight has weakened us, drained us of our resources, hit our morale. I'm afraid it is time for more desperate measures.\n\nWe have resorted to calling in a few favours with the natives, which allowed us to gather more equipment for the war machine that we must guide now. Weapons, supplies, anything goes, so long that it helps us take an edge in the conflict we face.\n\nUnfortunately, the natives were not satisfied with our actions and demands. But they will understand the inevitability of the situation and the price it carries."
jungle.7.a:0 "It's a necessary evil"

jungle.8.t:0 "The New Aztlan"
jungle.8.d:0 "The war is over, the sound of bullets do not fill our ears anymore, there is no need to hide in the cellar in fear of what lurks outside. The time when we were just a sorry bunch of survivors is over, and I will do my best to keep it that way.\n\nI will make a great country in here, these jugles suit me, after all. Although I did not anticipate how much I'll have to conquer in order to end this war. But my ponies need a leader, and they will have it, I will not let them down.\n\nWhile there are still remnants of the Lunar army and those who are hostile to my rule, I'd still mark it as an improvement to war. This is but a start of a new era, so, let's get to work."
jungle.8.a:0 "Well... Guess I'm a Dictator now"

jungle.9.t:0 "A Meeting With The Unions"
jungle.9.d:0 "With a heavy heart and cautious approach to I go to this meeting. After seeing what they're capable of, I am truly unsure what to expect here.\n\nBut the talks went just fine, they didn't try anything they would regret. And while I find their talk about the population or workers tedious, I can understand their point. My ponies need organisation, and it seems these unions can provide me just that. And they, clearly, wish to exist in their own ideology from before. At least they are not as radical as some others I have seen, so that's a plus.\n\nWhile our current discussion was a success, we've yet much to do before there's any real fruition. But I must say, I am pleasantly surprised."
jungle.9.a:0 "Reasonable ponies all in all"

jungle.10.t:0 "Meeting The Paramount Chiefs"
jungle.10.d:0 "I once studied these southern tribes, my intent was to turn profit. I fled here to turn profit, but my time here taught me much. I made a powerful and a very loyal ally among these tribes, and they had my back. I feel foolish for simply using them to meet my ends.\n\nFortunately, they are the forgiving kind, they understand that without me, they would be in a much worse state than they are now. I brought them gifts, as a token of my gratitude for our alliance, little did I know they had more on their mind for the celebration.\n\nThey greet me like a hero, and now, a feast is in order."
jungle.10.a:0 "Glad we still have their support"

jungle.11.t:0 "In The Jungle"
jungle.11.d:0 "While we have defeated our enemies in open battle, it is under the cover of the jungle that they keep fighting us, attacking villages in the darkness, smashing convoys and terrorising the civilians. The thestrals that lived under them still do not trust us, but that may yet be changed.\n\nI deem it unsafe to venture into the jungle without a gun, that is what I told my ponies to do as well. I did not seek an end to this war to continue with the slaughter of the innocents now. We've grown accustomed to the jungle way of life, we'll smoke them out, one way or another.\n\nThe howling shrieks echo every night, it cannot continue like this much longer. Things must change, and change soon. I can't have my ponies live in constant fear because of some terrorists in the woods, I will null this insufferable insurgency."
jungle.11.a:0 "We'll beat them eventually..."

jungle.12.t:0 "The Federation"
jungle.12.d:0 "A small state we once were, but those days are long over. We've fought a war, we've earned our freedom, no more we are a rogue state, now, we're a proper state, a country, we are Aztlan. A jungle, we have conquered, we made new allies who still stand by our side, all to be able to proudly say that we are free.\n\nI've assessed our current state, while not in mint condition, I vow to make it right. We've threats within, I will tend to them with a firm hoof, there will be no terror in Aztlan.\n\nAnd so, I, Caballeron, proclaim Aztlan to be a federation, we will stand proud next to one another. Our cause is just, our ponies, noble, it is not the question of survival anymore, now, it's disciple and order. The days of refuge are over."
jungle.12.a:0 "Long live Aztlan!"

jungle.13.t:0 "The Red Folder"
jungle.13.d:0 "Few wish to recall the recent events, this war didn't bring much good to any of us. It is with this in mind that I have decided that it's time to put aside our differences for once. To pardon our enemies is a great virtue, one that I do not give lightly.\n\nI put great expectations on this partnership, even if I'm not completely convinced. Peace is a greater virtue that I seek, we can have no peace without trust, so trust them I must.\n\nThey welcome my forgiveness, tell me how they hope we'll work well together. I hope for such myself, it's good to have allies in these times. I need more friends and not foes in here."
jungle.13.a:0 "A nice change of pace"

jungle.14.t:0 "Lifting The Union Ban"
jungle.14.d:0 "After observing and cooperating with the unions for some time, I have decided that it's time to lift the union ban. They've applied good organisation in my cities, which is a reassuring feeling. I'm glad the plan comes together.\n\nWith that in place, the discontent grows weaker, so I'm sure we're on a steady road to find stability once more. My subjects will live well, a life they deserve, a life I will give them.\n\nThere were no indicators so far that my trust in unions was misplaced, it better stay that way."
jungle.14.a:0 "Let's hope they won't cause too many issues"

jungle.15.t:0 "The Stallionist Trials"
jungle.15.d:0 "All the atrocities of the war keep surfacing like rotten fish in a stream. While I intend to cooperate with the socialists, radicalism will not stand in my presence. I've had my eye on these Stallionists, but their time is up.\n\nJustice is served this day, the terrorists will pay for their crimes. They've long sat in their cells, still unwilling to give up their diehard and fanatical beliefs. It must end now, they will be made an example of.\n\nLavender Berry, you stand accused of crimes against ponykind, for which you will pay with your blood. Kneel down and accept your fate!"
jungle.15.a:0 "Guilty as charged!"

jungle.16.t:0 "Socialist Parties Unbanned"
jungle.16.d:0 "With the progress made in regards to cooperation with the socialists, it seems they deliver on their promises. I must say, Cricket Chafer has proven to be a valuable asset, and it is time I complete my end of the bargain.\n\nI will allow socialist parties to exist in Aztlan, consider this to be my token of trust and gratitude. So longer that my ponies get to exist in peace and order.\n\nI am looking forward to our mutual existence."
jungle.16.a:0 "Just don't let it get out of hoof"

jungle.17.t:0 "The Native Language Act"
jungle.17.d:0 "The tribes have been the biggest aid in the forepassed conflict, but they will not be bygone. I have given them a promise to preserve and respect their culture, and that is what I will do. I am proud to be called their icniuhtli, and no friend of mine will be forgotten.\n\nI decree that the languages of the ponies native to these jungles are to be considered official languages of Aztlan. Any document, plea, decree or communication in them is to be considered valid and to be accepted. I welcome our allies with a big heart.\n\nLet's hope this doesn't get too complicated."
