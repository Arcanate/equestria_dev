### Focuses ###
JUN_decleration:0 "Stuck in a Strange Land"
JUN_decleration_desc:0 "Due to unforeseen circumstances it seems that we are in fact stuck running a country, in the middle of a jungle filled with dangerous fauna, flora, tribals, crazy cultists and annoying adventurers... but if we play our cards right perhaps we can still turn a profit here."
JUN_we_need_a_port:0 "Repurpose Saltmane"
JUN_we_need_a_port_desc:0 "Saltmane Coast is a splendid territory, but we require more than simple jungles and beaches for our war efforts. We shall turn this area into our primary port, to protect ourselves from sea threats as well."
JUN_we_need_the_guns:0 "Call In A Few Favours"
JUN_we_need_the_guns_desc:0 "The instability we face is not one to be taken lightly. Our assets are low, our stance, feeble. However, it will soon change. The means of combat is a small favour to ask in order to achieve control. There's no profit to be made if we can't even defend ourselves."
JUN_we_need_even_more:0 "And Then Some"
JUN_we_need_even_more_desc:0 "The dangers are always afoot, if we intend to stand a chance, more weapons are required. It's time we further increase our stockpile of armaments. Guns, grenades, ammunition, anything a soldier can need."
JUN_the_wealth_of_the_jungle:0 "The Riches of Aztlan"
JUN_the_wealth_of_the_jungle_desc:0 "This land is rich with goods and treasures, we need only be able to excavate them. I, Caballeron, demand quarries to be developed, lands will be razed and trees to be cut, the resources are everywhere, and they will be ours."
JUN_dedicated_smugglers:0 "Blockade Runners"
JUN_dedicated_smugglers_desc:0 "They think they can contain us in here, limit our income. This territory is ours now, and we'll use it to our advantage. Let's show them who controls these jungles, and who can smuggle through them better."
JUN_fortify_technochitlan:0 "Rebuild The Walls Of Tenochtitlan"
JUN_fortify_technochitlan_desc:0 "Tenochtitlan was once a fortress, an impenetrable bastion with great walls which none could surmount. We must rebuild them, that will provide us with a strategic standpoint and a defensive position, should such need arise. And perhaps, the locals will feel more accepting of our presence here."
JUN_reuse_the_ruins:0 "Repurpose the Ruins"
JUN_reuse_the_ruins_desc:0 "The Ruins here are old, crumbling, but they can still provide a solid foundation. We shall repurpose them for our own needs, build our structures upon the ancient land, there will be a stronghold raised here in no time, such is my will."
JUN_repair_the_cannals:0 "Repair The Canals"
JUN_repair_the_cannals_desc:0 "Rivers are a fickle landmark, wild and unpredictable, but if we can tame it, it will become our advantage. Repair the old canals, so that the water will provide us with resources, the river will become our line of transport and the shores will be our enemies' nightmare."
JUN_food_surplus:0 "Stock The Pantries"
JUN_food_surplus_desc:0 "Our supplies come steadily and surely, it is time to replenish our stocks. Load the pantries, let none of our supplies perish, or worse, get into our enemies' clutches. There will always be a good use for it later, our ponies will need it."
JUN_the_old_road:0 "Repair The Ohtli System"
JUN_the_old_road_desc:0 "So many things in here are still in half-decent state. They may not be of good use right now, but if we are to invest into renovations of these roads and structures, our infrastructure will flourish, just as these jungles do."
JUN_secondary_forts:0 "Raise The Towers"
JUN_secondary_forts_desc:0 "With all the elements I put in place, we're still exposed and scattered among these woods. Raise the towers! Our sight will span far and wide, none shall take us by surprise! These fortified constructions will bestow upon us a gratifying sense of security."
JUN_repair_the_temple:0 "Repair the Tonaltzintli Pyramid"
JUN_repair_the_temple_desc:0 "The culture and architecture of these locals is fascinating, the Tonaltzintli Pyramid is a prime example of an excellent edifice of the Neighua tribe. Though turned to a decrepit state with time, this temple may return to its former glory yet. May it inspire us well and provide refuge from the raging war. My only hope is that the chiefs can share my enthusiasm."
JUN_basic_manufacturies:0 "Tenochtitlan Manufacturies"
JUN_basic_manufacturies_desc:0 "With all the progress I've made to develop the framework here, the time has come to move to the next level. Our capital requires better factories, better production. We can finally set up a progressive manufacturing base here, the likes of which this land has not yet seen before."
JUN_basic_saw_mills:0 "Logging Camps"
JUN_basic_saw_mills_desc:0 "The jungles have no shortage of wood. Yet to harvest it more effectively, we need better tools and groundwork to support such activities. Build more sawmills, our logging camps will yield materials to the brim, we shall never run out of fine wood again."
JUN_win_them_over:0 "Meet With The Natives"
JUN_win_them_over_desc:0 "Perhaps these locals can be of use to us. After all, they're the natives here, it would be foolish to fight against them and not alongside them. We must organise a meeting, I know a way into their heart, there is a chance that they will listen to me."
JUN_hearts_and_minds:0 "Hearts And Minds"
JUN_hearts_and_minds_desc:0 "We must further our relationship with the Neighua. A fight for survival can unite anyone, and this is our chance. They may be dangerous, but if we sway them to our side, our cause, the dangers they present can become our tactical advantage."
JUN_borne_of_the_jungle:0 "Borne Of The Dark"
JUN_borne_of_the_jungle_desc:0 "With our agreements in place, our newfound allies entrusted us some of their best and most trained warriors. It is a great honour, and an opportunity that we must cherish. I welcome them, our partners will thrive, and our enemies will learn to fear these jungles."
JUN_bury_them_here:0 "Masters Of The Jungle"
JUN_bury_them_here_desc:0 "Our partnership allowed us to learn these territories in their greatest details. Every nook and cranny that these locals have lived among for ages, their secrets, are now part of our intelligence. Ultimately, it seems this ally has become our greatest asset yet."
JUN_the_chosen:0 "Chosen By The Gods"
JUN_the_chosen_desc:0 "Their culture is a curious one. Odd, but has its uses, perhaps I underestimated them. They wish to offer us to be chosen by the Gods. Such tales are quaint, but the ferocity and cunning of these ponies is undeniable. We shall take them on their offer, it is bound to help our relationship in the future."
JUN_the_final_push:0 "Fight For Aztlan"
JUN_the_final_push_desc:0 "After all we've gone through, I never gave up, we never gave up, and never will. These jungles were a dangerous place, full of perils on every step. They still are, but thanks to our allies, it is only our enemies that see them as such. The Neighua and their culture, their knowledge, is part of our own now. We are free, and this is our land now, we will fight for it as if it were our own. Now, we are home. For Aztlan!"

JUN_army_debate:0 "The Milchimalli"
JUN_army_debate_desc:0 "At last Aztlan is free from Equestrian imperialism but it would be foolish for us to expect it to stand forever out of sheer international goodwill. To make sure our independence isn’t snuffed out like so many others in history, we will need to build a military. Let us make sure that anypony entering the jungle with hostile intention will never come out of it."
JUN_equestrian_tactics:0 "Lessons From The Equestrians"
JUN_equestrian_tactics_desc:0 "Aztlan has freed itself from the Equestrian yoke. But despite our success, we remain woefully behind in terms of pony warfare and much of it comes either from ancestral and obsolete traditions or from adventurers. If we are to truly build an army, we need to study military theory and tactics. And the easiest one to learn from is the Equestrian doctrine."
JUN_trucks:0 "Adopt the Jackalope"
JUN_trucks_desc:0 "Logistics have been one of the most important aspect of warfare throughout history and one the native tribes have been truly apt at. However, modern warfare poses challenges that are simply impossible to overcome with our traditions. Our engineers have repurposed some Sicameonese all-terrain trucks to be jungle-ready, calling it the Jackalope. Let’s adopt it to bolster our supply lines."
JUN_new_rifles:0 "Standardise Rifle Models"
JUN_new_rifles_desc:0 "Our soldiers use a variety of weapons acquired through all kinds of ways since the early days of the independence war. This has produced a logistical nightmare for our forces. We need to standardise our guns as soon as possible. If we fail to do so, whole divisions may be stuck on the frontline without ammunition or working rifle to fire at the enemy."
JUN_sturdy_shovels:0 "The Aztlan Engineer Corps"
JUN_sturdy_shovels_desc:0 "Jungle warfare is a deeply complex affair, one where fortification can be a tremendous asset in combat but one that is strategically difficult to use. However, our military staff has combined experience from our native tribes and the various adventurers brought in by Caballeron. Together, they have designed a doctrine for a mobile Engineer Corps that could establish infrastructure and fortification in a quick and disposable way."
JUN_light_tanks_f:0 "The Chimalli"
JUN_light_tanks_f_desc:0 "Our jungles are undeniably a terrain hostile to mobile warfare but through careful adaptation of imported tankette, we have learned ways to use mechanized vehicles in them. The result of these experiments is the newly designed Chimalli light tank, a small but highly sturdy tank. There still won’t be glorious mechanized charges through the trees and wetlands but surgical use of the Chimalli will prove devastating on the battlefield."
JUN_new_artillery:0 "Aztlan Artillery Corps"
JUN_new_artillery_desc:0 "Anypony who has ever fought in a jungle knows who devastating and confusing a well-placed shell can be. But any artillery officer who has fought in a jungle can tell you how difficult it is to maintain proper artillery in that kind of terrain, let alone moving it around effectively. But it will be well worth the effort, if only to have the Equestrians and foreigners get a taste of their own medicine."
JUN_new_officers:0 "Scour The Jungles For Talent"
JUN_new_officers_desc:0 "Despite our recruitment binge since the independence, our military staff is still severely lacking. Let us send headhunters throughout the jungles to seek talent among the native tribes and equestrian frontier settlements. They are bound to find tactically minded ponies fit for leadership."
JUN_train_them:0 "Put Them Through Tartarus"
JUN_train_them_desc:0 "Some nations have the luxury to slowly train and. We do not. Aztlan’s birth was a painful and bloody affair. What we need are warriors that can take on any threat in a moment’s notice. For this purpose, we will put our recruits through the most gruesome of training regiment. Those who will come out of the jungle after it will be formidable warriors. The others who do not shall be remembered as martyrs of our independence."
JUN_adapt_to_the_jungle:0 "Born Out Of The Jungle"
JUN_adapt_to_the_jungle_desc:0 "While a great deal of our soldiers are of Neighua heritage and know how to live in a jungle environment, many of our recruits do not, especially those coming from the coastal cities of Aztlan. To remedy this, a special training program has been instituted to send recruits deep into the Aztlan interior under native and veterans leadership to learn how to survive, move and fight in the jungle."
JUN_sapper_tactics:0 "Sapper Tactics"
JUN_sapper_tactics_desc:0 "The jungle is a tricky terrain, one which to the unprepared soldier, is as much if not more dangerous than the enemy itself. Neighua hunters have long learned to become trickier themselves and became experts in trap making. We can apply this to the way we wage war and formalize it to gain an edge over our enemies, most of whom have never seen much beyond welcoming woods."
JUN_nastive_tactics:0 "Lessons Of The Jungle"
JUN_nastive_tactics_desc:0 "While some argue for standardization of our army along Equestrian lines, it is undeniable that Aztlan’s military situation is unique. As such, rather than pursuing unsuitable tactics, we should develop our own form of warfare. We have a long native tradition to draw from, as well as from the adventurers Caballeron’s drew in. Foreign expertise is welcome of course but it should be sensible. We can draw inspiration from military theorists in Pueto Caballo, Sicameon or Zebrica."
JUN_codetalkers:0 "The Huallauhatlatollamini"
JUN_codetalkers_desc:0 "Neighua dialects are by all accounts obscure languages. While it is highly disappointing when it comes to our cultural radiance worldwide, it is undeniably a military asset. Enemies who intercept our messages would be hard pressed to gain any intel from them if they lack even a basic dictionary. To exploit this at its maximum, we will take steps to assign communications tasks to Neighua soldiers or educate our communication officers in those dialects."
JUN_integrate_bat_units:0 "Integrate The Tzinacatl Divisions"
JUN_integrate_bat_units_desc:0 "For a long time now, our Neighua military staff has bitterly opposed allowing bat ponies to serve in our military. This is a costly policy, one that could cost us victories in the bloody years to come. Our contacts among the Tzinacatl tribes do show that they are willing to serve and even desire to prove their worth in the new Aztlan state. It will require a lot of political capital and hooves on the ground to convince them and move forward but it is an investment well worth the time and effort."
JUN_officer_schools:0 "Officer Schools"
JUN_officer_schools_desc:0 "Despite the tireless work of our headhunters, we cannot hope to continue relying on gifted natives and adventurers to lead our armies. We need to invest resources in opening officer schools in our major settlements and educate the next generation of Aztlanian officers. We’ll need to bring in foreign officers with a more orthodox military education. Equestrian defectors have already shown interests, as well as contacts in Sicameon and Puerto Caballo."
JUN_electronics_military:0 "Adopt the RADAR"
JUN_electronics_military_desc:0 "Waging war effectively always require information but the newly invented RADAR technology has transformed the ways one can acquire tactical information. It will require electrification and significant investment either in infrastructure or adapted vehicles but it will pay off in the long run."
JUN_spec_ops_department:0 "Special Forces Department"
JUN_spec_ops_department_desc:0 "Our extreme training regimen has demonstrated its effectiveness but the toll it took on our armed forces’ morale made it necessary to ease it. However, it allowed us to select soldier who thrived despite the Tartarus treatment. These soldiers were called upon when our generals began to work on establishing a special forces department. Now, these ponies can put their special skills to good use in the most difficult missions."
JUN_army_of_aztlan:0 "The Protectors of Aztlan"
JUN_army_of_aztlan_desc:0 "Aztlan has long known woes of all kind. Our independence was stolen from us when we were betrayed by our god. No more. Aztlan now stands free. There may be war. There may be burning. Lives will be lost. But in the end, our enemies shall flee and our victorious soldiers will find their way home, to Tenochtitlan."

JUN_aztlan_airforce:0 "The Aztlan Airforce"
JUN_aztlan_airforce_desc:0 "When the Aztlanians used to look up in the sky, they would see nothing but Equestrian pegasi, Equestrian planes or the dreaded dragons. If we are to safeguard our independence and control over the jungles, we’ll need to build an airforce."
JUN_import_fighters:0 "Import Fighter Craft"
JUN_import_fighters_desc:0 "Aztlan as it stands doesn’t have much in terms of planes in its airfield. If we are to dominate our own sky, we won’t do it with repurposed civilian planes and repaired downed equestrian planes. We can acquire some planes from various sellers in Griffonia to kickstart our airforce."
JUN_light_aircraft:0 "The Quetzalcoatl"
JUN_light_aircraft_desc:0 "Ever since creatures have conquered the sky without magic or their own wings, the ponies of Aztlan only got to see others watching others flying. Worse, Aztlan has long been a place for foreign or Equestrian aerobats to show off their skills. However, through creativity and determination, one of our engineer has put together plans for an entirely Aztlanian fighter plane. He has called it the Quetzacoatl, in honor of our tradition."
JUN_CAS_f:0 "The Cuitlatlotli"
JUN_CAS_f_desc:0 "Warfare in the Southeast has been mostly land-based, with planes fighting an almost unrelated form of combat. But many of our pilots have proven to be anxious to help our soldiers on the ground. So much so that our military court is swamped with disciplinary hearings over dangerous low-altitude actions. Tired of punishing our pilots for what we should recognize as acts of bravery, our military staff has decided to put them to use with specialized airplanes."
JUN_import_bombers:0 "Import Bomber Craft"
JUN_import_bombers_desc:0 "Using our planes to prevent hostile bombers from wrecking our forces and infrastructure is a desirable goal but it leaves so much potential unexplored. Through contacts in Sicameon, we have found opportunities to import our very own bombers. It’s time that we are able to turn tables on our enemies."
JUN_bomber_aircraft:0 "The Cuauhtli"
JUN_bomber_aircraft_desc:0 "Importing Bombers has allowed us to bolster our airforce but it is a costly and unreliable source. Our engineer have studied the model and through some retro engineering, they have come up with a new model, one that can be built locally at a much cheaper cost."
JUN_heavier_bombers:0 "The Tepopoloani"
JUN_heavier_bombers_desc:0 "Tactical bombing is all well and good but our engineers have pushed forward a new concept, one that is revolutionizing warfare throughout the world : long-range bombing. No more will war in the Southeast be a distant affair read about in the ninth page of the newspaper for our bombers will bring war to our enemies’ home."
JUN_build_the_airstrips:0 "Construct the Airstrips"
JUN_build_the_airstrips_desc:0 "One of the most significant issue we are still facing today is the lack of airfields in Aztlan. The old airstrips on the coast have served their purpose but they are not enough. Our pilots still dread any issue when flying over our own jungle heartland. We need to take steps so our cities are connected to our airways."
JUN_train_the_pilots:0 "Train The Pilots"
JUN_train_the_pilots_desc:0 "Our airforce has seen significant improvement since we have established it. However, our pilot corps still leaves to be desired. Even by the kindest terms, it remains a ragtag bunch of adventurers, Equestrian defectors, mercenaries and some self-taught heroes of the independence war. While they are definitely worthy of praise for their enthusiasm and romantic charm, we can’t expect to rely on them much longer. It is time to establish a standardized training program for our recruits and to create a proper air academy."
JUN_heavier_fighters:0 "The Tepoz Cuauhtli"
JUN_heavier_fighters_desc:0 "Even with our investments in airfields, the Southeast remains a difficult place to fly over. Many a good pilot has been lost to the jungle or mechanical failure due to exhausted engines. As much as we can push our sturdy Quetzacoatls, there are many missions these planes are simply unsuited for. Our military staff and engineers have issued a plane for a new kind of heavy fighter : the Tepoz Cuauhtli. With it, they say, true air superiority is achievable."
JUN_night_fliers:0 "Night Fliers"
JUN_night_fliers_desc:0 "Since times immemorial, Aztlanians have known the value of hunting in the night. Let us put that martial tradition to use in the air! May our enemies experience the terrors of the night in Aztlan..."
JUN_expert_fliers:0 "Children Of Quetzalcoatl"
JUN_expert_fliers_desc:0 "”Look up in the sky! It’s a bird! It’s a plane! It IS a plane! And that plane belongs to the Aztlan Airforce!”"

JUN_aztlan_navy:0 "The Aztlan Navy"
JUN_aztlan_navy_desc:0 "For centuries, Aztlan has been denied free access to the sea but now that we are free from Equestrian imperialism, we may begin to work on a navy and truly open ourselves to the world."
JUN_baltimare_port:0 "The Baltimare Dockyards"
JUN_baltimare_port_desc:0 "The dockyards in Baltimare have been one of the most important ones in the southeast. Sadly, they have been badly damaged when we wrestled control over the city from the revolutionaries. With some repairs, this symbol of equestrian naval power may become one for Aztlan."
JUN_stableside_port:0 "The Stableside Dockyards"
JUN_stableside_port_desc:0 "Stableside is one of the few cities in the Southeast that has an actual industrial capacity, and the only coastal one at that. As such, it is home to many civilian dockyards but with some investment from our part, we could transform it into a major military harbour. Without those investments, the dream of an Aztlanian navy will remain just that."
JUN_destroyer_f:0 "The Aztlan Coast Guard"
JUN_destroyer_f_desc:0 "Equus’ southeastern coast is a dangerous place. Pirates and privateers are no rarity and dragons flying over from their isles often cause chaos in naval activities. Establishing a Coast Guard will allow us to begin establishing some order."
JUN_light_cruiser_f:0 "Heavier Plating"
JUN_light_cruiser_f_desc:0 "Small destroyers and repurposed civilian ships will only take us so far in creating a navy. We need to invest in cruisers able to withstand prolonged combat. At first, we may use them as command ships for our coastal fleets but in the years to come, they will be a significant asset to support our larger ships."
JUN_saltmane_port:0 "The Saltmane Dockyards"
JUN_saltmane_port_desc:0 "Baltimare and Stableside are serving their purpose as naval bases but their position on our periphery is hurting our naval capabilities. Meanwhile, our strategically placed coastal city of Saltmane is severely lacking in naval infrastructure. By aggressively investing there, we can finally link up our northern and southwestern navies and facilitate communication between our naval staff and Tenochtitlan."
JUN_submarine_f:0 "The Hidden Navy"
JUN_submarine_f_desc:0 "Even with heavy investments, it will take a long time for Aztlan to have a navy capable of withstanding direct contact. However, we are no stranger to asymmetrical warfare and fighting stronger forces. Let us take into account the lessons of our land warfare history and apply them to our naval plans. Our submarines shall lurk under the sea until we are ready for more orthodox forms of naval combat."
JUN_heavy_cruiser_f:0 "Light Battleships"
JUN_heavy_cruiser_f_desc:0 "Our dockyards have proven to be surprisingly adaptable to our growing demands on building and maintaining warships. The reports on our cruiser experiments have demonstrated that they are ready for heavier experiments. As a result, our naval engineers have put forward a plan to create a light battleship, the first one to be named the [JUN.GetLeader]"
JUN_doctrianl_development:0 "Doctrinal Development"
JUN_doctrianl_development_desc:0 "Despite our progress, our military staff is still a mess composed of Equestrian defectors and foreign adventurers. As a result, our navy functions without a proper doctrine. We need to sort out the doctrinal debate and fix ourselves some objectives about where we wish to take our navy. Aztlan’s independence may very well depend on it."
JUN_battleship_f:0 "The War Navy"
JUN_battleship_f_desc:0 "With our navy beginning to take to the seas and our sailors becoming more experimented, the days of smaller objectives are now behind us. Aztlan is a small power still but the seas are merciless. If we are to exist as a naval nation, we need a true war navy. One that will be lead by true fortresses of the seas. It will be a difficult and long endeavour but if we do not take steps towards this end now, Aztlan shall never be safe, let alone powerful on the world stage."
JUN_carrier_f:0 "Carrier Experiments"
JUN_carrier_f_desc:0 "Anypony sailing in the Southeast has already witnessed a dragon flying over. This has lead many of our naval officers to understand the potential and power of air power applied to naval warfare whereas many naval staff throughout the world still hold doubts about it. This has lead to many early designs for carrier ships, most of which were utterly unattainable for our meager naval capabilities. With our newly acquired experience and infrastructure, we may at last work on them."
JUN_new_admirality:0 "The Aztlan Admiralty"
JUN_new_admirality_desc:0 "With the incredible progress achieved by our fledgling navy, it is time for us to finally establish it as an independent branch of our military forces. Gone are the days our naval operations were haphazardly directed from Tenochtitlan. An independent Admiralty will be set up in their own new headquarters in the modernized port of Saltmane. From there, our admirals shall work tirelessly to make sure that one day Aztlan will rule the waves."

JUN_the_three_regions:0 "The Three Regions"
JUN_the_three_regions_desc:0 "The war of independence is over and now I must attend to the duties of statecraft. I have to say that the dangers of budget balancing are not as thrilling as those of a jungle trek and I’d rather face down a hungry tiger than a politician. But I don’t get a choice. Now, Aztlan is in a difficult spot as it is more of a put-together mess of three barely connected regions than a united nation. Worse, all three have been left devastated by the war and bad Equestrian policies. Choices will have to be made and with the state of our treasury, they won’t be easy ones."
JUN_stableside_region:0 "Stableside"
JUN_stableside_region_desc:0 "While no economic giant at the continental level, Stableside is the industrial heart of the Southeast. Sadly, the war has taken its toll on it. Many industrialists have fled the city, often with significant assets and expertise, despite Daring Do’s reassurance. Some loyalists followed them when my forces neared the city. And war being war, the local infrastructure and many of the factories have been badly damaged. It will take time and effort to restore it all to greatness but I’m nothing if not persistent."
JUN_the_steel_mills:0 "Support The Steel Mills"
JUN_the_steel_mills_desc:0 "While the Southeast has never been steel country, Aztlan cannot afford to keep importing steel. Fortunately for us, geologists in the last decade speculated that the Macintosh mountains were home to significant deposits of coal and iron. Some Hoofington industrialists had begun to try and tap into it but the civil war put the lid on that. However, the mines they had begun to set up are still there and industrialists in Stableside have expressed interest in the steel industry. With some support, I can help them take the place of the Hoofingtonians."
JUN_the_arms_factories:0 "Subsidise The Arms Industry"
JUN_the_arms_factories_desc:0 "Despite the presence of some small-arms companies, most of them belonging to the Sturdy Stable Industries group, the Southeast has little in the way of weapons manufacturing. With my treasury having more flies than gold, I can hardly hope to set up a state-owned military-industrial complex but I can subsidise the private industrialists willing to set it up themselves. With these subsidies, I can attract some opportunistic weapons manufacturers. The world usually has no shortage of them."
JUN_bauxite_mines:0 "Bauxite Mining"
JUN_bauxite_mines_desc:0 "Ever since the Stalliongrad revolution, the aluminium industry in Equestria has been in crisis. Without access to the Severnayan production, Equestria has been forced to rely on Olenian and transcontinental imports. Fortunately for us, a geologist found traces of bauxite in the Sirius region. They remain largely untapped but with some investments, we can open large scale mining as well as smelteries in Galloprey."
JUN_portland_oil_wells:0 "Portland Oil Wells"
JUN_portland_oil_wells_desc:0 "The southeastern tips of Equus have always been known to be rather poor areas and the biggest city there, Portland, has always been nothing more than a relay port. There’s nothing to do there. Well it would be if not for me. During my travels, I once met an adventurer who explained to me that the region was home to oil deposits. Once he returned home to Manehattan, he was sure to become incredibly wealthy from the discovery, he said. Sadly for him, the malaria took him but I never forgot about the story. And now I’ve got the means to do something with it!"
JUN_connect_the_area:0 "Repair The Railways"
JUN_connect_the_area_desc:0 "Before the Civil War, the Stableside administration proudly inaugurated an extensive railway network connecting the Stargulf coast cities as well as their hinterlands. Unfortunately, the civil war caused significant damages to the tracks. Combats and sabotage brought down years of work. Now without the railways, the resources we extract in Sirius, Portland and the Macintosh mountains will pretty much sit there, useless. I need to repair them fast or all my efforts will have been for nothing."
JUN_stableside_primacy:0 "Stableside Primacy"
JUN_stableside_primacy_desc:0 "By continuing to invest in Stableside and making permanent my subsidies and tax breaks to the industry, I can kickstart a true industrial boom in Aztlan, one that could make it a continental powerhouse. Sadly, my budget is limited and if we pursue this road, many of my project in Tenochtitlan and Baltimare will have to remain limited. Some even point out that by doing this, I am only resuming Equestria’s imperialist projects, betraying the promises I made to the natives. But that just might be the cost of peak industrial performance."
JUN_central_region:0 "Tenochtitlan"
JUN_central_region_desc:0 "Ah Tenochtitlan. Immortal city of my heart. City of lakes and canals. But also a city of ruins… Truth be told, the jungles of Aztlan don’t have much to offer. Centuries of equestrian imperialism transformed let an entire civilization be lost to the vines. But some like myself can see through the thick canopy and I see a land of opportunities and of virgin beauty. Something can be done here. Should. Must. I promise it."
JUN_connect_the_jungles:0 "Connect The Tribes"
JUN_connect_the_jungles_desc:0 "The greatest issue faced by the Neighua tribes and other natives is the lack of transportation and communication between various settlements. Now that we are free from the imperialist thinking of Celestia’s administration, we can connect them in a way that allows the tribes to meet and live together once more. Some will complain that these roads will be expensive and not entirely efficient but I say some things are well worth the cost!"
JUN_technochitlan_university:0 "Tenochtitlan University"
JUN_technochitlan_university_desc:0 "When I wrote my thesis on the Tenochtitlan civilisation, I complained about the lack of archeological studies on the Neighua history. And in the years that followed, it only grow worse as all of Aztlan became nothing more than a decor for Daring Do’s adventure books! It is time that this city becomes a scholarly center. If we are to kickstart a revival of this region, we must first learn to know ourselves. I know something about it."
JUN_tourism:0 "Support The Tourism Industry"
JUN_tourism_desc:0 "Tenochtitlan’s jungles may not have towering skyscrapers, nor does it have buzzing marketplaces or humming factories. What it has is a raw and untamed beauty, one I fell in love with a long time ago. Creatures around the world may not know it but they need to see it, to experience the life changing experience that is roaming about the jungle. And I’ll provide it to them. For a price."
JUN_limited_exploitation:0 "Limited Exploitation"
JUN_limited_exploitation_desc:0 "Aztlanian jungles are rich in rubber and industrialists have been pestering me for exploiting them. There is no glamour or beauty in the rubber business but it pays and a modern world requires a lot of it. Unfortunately, it is also a form of exploitation that requires vast swathes of land as you simply can’t make intensive use of the lands for those trees. I will allow exploitation but only on a limited scale. Those greedy bastards would bleed this jungle dry if left unchecked.."
JUN_national_parks:0 "The National Park Act"
JUN_national_parks_desc:0 "Working on the Tenochtitlan revival, I realized something simple but that, despite all my studies, I failed to realize. The devouring march of industrialization may destroy land but it pays while preserving these land’s beauty does not. If I want to have the means to preserve Aztlan, I need the money. But I can only gain it by allowing some destruction of it. I made my choice in this dilemma but the temptation may be too strong for my successors. We need legislation. A thoughtful decision to put aside some land to be forever kept as virgin as they were when the Sun and the Moon began their dance in the sky and let the rest be open for the destructive march of civilisation."
JUN_technochitlan_primacy:0 "Tenochtitlan Primacy"
JUN_technochitlan_primacy_desc:0 "The Aztlan Revival is costly and many in Stableside and Baltimare criticize me for it. I still need a lot of resources to fulfill my promises to the Neighuas. If I attain my objectives, the heart of the country will truly beat healthily again. Of course, it will mean that our industrialization will be somewhat slowed down in an age where everything accelerates at neck-breaking speed. But if I don’t, can the Neighuas really wait for another chance at carving their place in the modern world? It is tempting for me to say yes. But what would that make me but a sellout? A very rich sellout..."
JUN_baltimare_region:0 "Baltimare"
JUN_baltimare_region_desc:0 "Baltimare is the most populated city in our new Aztlan. It is by far one of the most modern of our cities, being a part of the larger east-equestrian coast. However, despite its strategic location and natural advantages, it was always less favored by industrials and investors than her sister cities such as Manehattan or Fillydelphia. Some cities would have answered with apathy but the Baltimareans stood proud. They unionized and made do with what little they had. And when the civil war torn Equestria apart, they fought a revolution. While we ended up in opposite sides, I respect them for it. And under my rule, Baltimare won’t be forgotten anymore."
JUN_steel_mills_baltimare:0 "The Baltimare Coal Mines"
JUN_steel_mills_baltimare_desc:0 "During the industrial revolution, Baltimare became a major center of coal production. While it ruined much of the countryside, it also gave the city jobs and a valuable resource to export. While Equestria had access to other options, I do not. The Baltimare rebirth will begin with coal and with it steel."
JUN_industrial_development_bal:0 "Industrial Grants"
JUN_industrial_development_bal_desc:0 "Baltimare is home to a large population and many skilled workers. What it has always lacked is interest and attention from Canterlot and coastal industrialists. But who am I if not the pony that sees opportunities where others do not? With some grants, I can help new industries to grow and thrive there."
JUN_industrial_tech_f:0 "Modern Industrial Methods"
JUN_industrial_tech_f_desc:0 "I have little interest in the “science” that assembly line optimization is supposed to be but I’ve been told that a lot of money can be made with “streamlining” and other nonsense. Apparently, Baltimare sociologists and union workers have designed a great number of improvements that would make our industry both more productive and safer. I’ll just give them room to do whatever and pray never to hear the sound of their voice ever again."
JUN_baltimare_technical_institute:0 "Baltimare Technical Institute"
JUN_baltimare_technical_institute_desc:0 "Baltimare is home to many skilled workers but most of them had to learn their craft the hard way. Many of them put themselves at risk and couldn’t even use their skills as a bargaining chip in labour negotiations. Baltimarean labor unions have long argued for public technical institutes to teach fillies and colts valuable professional skills. Industrialists only care about their bottom line but I, doctor Cabelleron, understands the value of education. I’ll give the unions their schools."
JUN_baltimare_industrial_park:0 "The Baltimare Industrial Park"
JUN_baltimare_industrial_park_desc:0 "Baltimare is once again buzzing with activity and union workers are finally smiling again. My policies has brought back a momentum in the economic life of the city and it is time to capitalize on it. By opening a new and modern industrial park, I can help new industries to grow there."
JUN_baltimare_primacy:0 "Baltimare Primacy"
JUN_baltimare_primacy_desc:0 "With continued investment and focused industrial planning, we can transform Baltimare into a major industrial center by the next decades. However, it will take massive resources but there is no way we can hope to invest them here and still pursue my more ambitious plans elsewhere. It is not without risks either. By focusing so strongly on the Baltimare region, we remain economically dependent on the greater east-equestrian region for our economy which could put us in a rough spot should Equestria’s troubles deepen. Worse, it would leave the tribal regions and the whole Southeast in a state of continued underdevelopment. Maybe I cannot afford to break the Baltimare curse but can I afford not to?"
JUN_economic_prosperity:0 "True Prosperity"
JUN_economic_prosperity_desc:0 "Through determination and skill, I have lead my ponies to great length. Gone are the days the Southeast used to be a downtrodden region. Our investments have paid off and we are now experiencing a golden age. However, choices had to be made and while I can see a bright future for my people, the thought of what could have been had I chosen differently still haunts me. So many hopes and dreams I have broken. Will I ever be able to make up for them?"

JUN_the_political_situation_desc:0 "After a long fight for our freedom, we have finally achieved peace in our time. I can only imagine where things will take us from here.

JUN_meet_the_unions:0 "Extend A Hoof To The Unions"
JUN_meet_the_unions_desc:0 "I heard a lot about these unions, but I am not sure if they can be trusted. I will propose them a meeting, to discuss our terms, we'll see what they are worth then. Still, I can't help but feel that my ponies may need their aid in the long term."

JUN_allow_unions:0 "Allow Unions"
JUN_allow_unions_desc:0 "What they propose doesn't seem out of the borders of what I would call reasonable. I cannot always be there for my ponies, and I say unions can help me with that. I will allow them, provided they don't pull any antics and do their job aiding the civilians."

JUN_the_agreement:0 "Allow Socialist Parties"
JUN_the_agreement_desc:0 "For the better or for the worse, we're yet to see, but I think it's time we allow socialist parties as well. They've proven their worth, and to secure our position, I need not make new enemies. I hope I won't be disappointed."
JUN_detente:0 "Peace With The Left"

JUN_the_language_act_desc:0 "It appears I have earned a great favour of the local tribes, it is now my turn to return them the boon. They value their culture greatly, while I did my best to preserve their land and sacred places, I can do them a courtesy more. I will make them official members of our society, by making their languages official."

JUN_cultural_institute_desc:0 "More and more of Neighua ponies, our biggest ally, seem to be interested in moving to the cities, live together with the rest. I welcome them, and I've just the idea how to make them happier. I have studied their tribe in my academic times, and now I wish to pay them a tribute by giving them their own cultural institue. Their history and culture will not be forgotten."
JUN_bat_rights_act:0 "The Fourth Tribe"
JUN_bat_rights_act_desc:0 "These bats are a resilient batch, I must give them that. But, not all of them seem to be bent on opposing us. I've had reports of entire thestral groups being peaceful and conflict-avoiding. I will decree the bats no longer outlawed, perhaps that will force them out of hiding and they'll be willing to talk."
JUN_hunt_the_remnants:0 "Hunt The Extremists"
JUN_hunt_the_remnants_desc:0 "While being a bat is not a crime, being a terrorist is, and it will not be tolerated. The days of travelling with a gun in our own jungles are over, we will take the fight to them. Raze the jungle, my scouts, find and eliminate the extremists."

JUN_end_the_nightmare_desc:0 "The bats on our side provided more than one could anticipate, I underestimated then indeed. Having the need to hide and survive in the jungle by themselves, these thestrals were also bullied by the extremists for being too cowardly.

### Events ###
jungle.1.t:0 "The Paramount Chiefs"
jungle.1.d:0 "One is never sure what to expect when they meet the local tribes whose lands you come into. I studied them, but I can't be ready for everything. Will they be savage? Will they ambush us? Will they want to work together with us? Though, it still gives me hope that they agreed to this meeting. We're not in the best position to bargain right now.\n\nYet still, despite all the possible issues, the chiefs were friendly to us. Perhaps, they appreciate the respect I tried to show for their culture, or they simply realise that the war closing in around us can threaten their peace as well as their stability, or even their well-being. The summit was a success, and they will aid us find our place in these jungles, while we will offer them protection.\n\nWhile their strings were easy to pull, they made themselves clear, they will cooperate, on the condition that we respect their customs, their tradition and their culture. A small price to pay for the shelter of an ancient and powerful ally who know the landscape better than any one us ever will."
jungle.1.a:0 "I'm glad we are working together"

jungle.2.t:0 "Hearts And Minds"
jungle.2.d:0 "It seems that both of us came to the same conclusion, a misfortune united us, but it is I who will turn it into our fortune. Same as us, they see the great benefit of our cooperation, we provide them with a barrier, better infrastructure and the possibility to rebuild their long lost greatness, the structures that were beaten and eroded with time, the harsh jungle weather and the previous occupants. While on their end, they give is insight on the landscape, the safe paths, the dangerous glades and even some hidden treasures.\n\nIt was an underestimation from my side, what they're capable of. A frail mistake, to doubt them, but that doesn't matter now, for our hearts and minds are focused on the same purpose, survival.\n\nWe shall see how our mutual future will turn out, but for now, this alliance proves itself to be a promising treat."
jungle.2.a:0 "Aztlan shall be free!"

jungle.3.t:0 "Conflicts of Interest"
jungle.3.d:0 "It appears that our local friends are not too happy with the recent expansion of our logging efforts. Soon after the new mills started toppling the glades and piling the wood, the chiefs called us for an emergency meeting.\n\nThey were adamant about the value of land for them, the resources it provided, a relationship that should not be overstepped. They looked at me with a lightning glare, but their dissatisfaction still finished with only puffs and grunts, as they did not take any major actions about it.\n\nWhile resources are required, I did not want to show signs of weakness. Neighua do not like weakness, that I know well. However, we can only hope that they do understand the purpose of our actions, the enormous war effort that we carry, and forgive us for it. I may be harsh, but I think I was too harsh this time. Hm, I shall yet rebuild their jungle sweep and wide."
jungle.3.a:0 "Rather unfortunate"

jungle.4.t:0 "Squatter Troubles"
jungle.4.d:0 "Our continued effort to gather more resources has attracted new interest to our territories. Not all of it, however, I can call positive and useful. A problem arose out of it, the squatters started taking up more and more of our space.\n\nOne can only wonder where do they even come from, but riches, or even better, commodities, do appear to have that effect. The surrounding areas of our pantries is more like slums for poor and adventurers alike now. They don't seem to have the intention to leave, either.\n\nThough I need to focus on my own kind first, this pest do not seem to be all that harmful, other than to our supplies and reputation, yet we cannot ignore them.\n\nThere is strength in numbers, we have enough resources, I'll find a use for these lackeys. Unlike the sun, the work never sets at the horizon, there's always more of it. If they wish to stay, they will stay, but first they'll earn their bread."
jungle.4.a:0 "At least we can put them to work..."

jungle.5.t:0 "The Wonders of Irrigation"
jungle.5.d:0 "Oh, water, a crucial resource for any civilisation, and these jungles are abundant with it. From humidity to rivers, sometimes I wish there was less of it. But by taming the flow of the river, we can utilise it to suit our every need.\n\nOur fields bloom, our citizens thrive, all thanks to the improved infrastructure. Truly a display of our power and a victory for our well-being. The influence we exert on this realm only grows.\n\nAhh, the wonders of irrigation. "
jungle.5.a:0 "Ain't it beautiful?"

jungle.6.t:0 "An Amazing Discovery"
jungle.6.d:0 "Restoring the old ruins was no easy task, I knew that myself. The stones, old, crude, uneven, are hard to work with. I feared that this whole operation will be more woeful than it would be profitable.\n\nUntil, one day, we hit upon a secret chamber in one of the ruins' catacombs compartments. It was filled with riches beyond my imagination, and this time, no pesky adventurers to stop me from claiming what is mine. The locals were right when they told us to investigate this place. I can only wonder if perhaps, they wanted us to find these? Nevertheless, the discovery raised the spirits of the ponies, and it seemed as if all the previous inconveniences simply vanished and the work continued without a hitch.\n\nWith all the new structures in place, and the fresh treasures in our vaults, this province starts looking all the more promising to me."
jungle.6.a:0 "Gold, gems, and more!"

jungle.7.t:0 "Native Complaints"
jungle.7.d:0 "The war is looming on us all, and we are in no way having an advantageous predicament in it yet. The fight has weakened us, drained us of our resources, hit our morale. I'm afraid it is time for more desperate measures.\n\nWe have resorted to calling in a few favours with the natives, which allowed us to gather more equipment for the war machine that we must guide now. Weapons, supplies, anything goes, so long that it helps us take an edge in the conflict we face.\n\nUnfortunately, the natives were not satisfied with our actions and demands. But they will understand the inevitability of the situation and the price it carries."
jungle.7.a:0 "It's a necessary evil"

jungle.8.t:0 "The New Aztlan"
jungle.8.d:0 "The war is over, the sound of bullets do not fill our ears anymore, there is no need to hide in the cellar in fear of what lurks outside. The time when we were just a sorry bunch of survivors is over, and I will do my best to keep it that way.\n\nI will make a great country in here, these jungles suit me, after all. Although I did not anticipate how much I'll have to conquer in order to end this war. But my ponies need a leader, and they will have it, I will not let them down.\n\nWhile there are still remnants of the Lunar army and those who are hostile to my rule, I'd still mark it as an improvement to war. This is but a start of a new era, so, let's get to work."
jungle.8.a:0 "Well... Guess I'm a Dictator now"

jungle.9.t:0 "A Meeting With The Unions"
jungle.9.d:0 "With a heavy heart and cautious approach to I go to this meeting. After seeing what they're capable of, I am truly unsure what to expect here.\n\nBut the talks went just fine, they didn't try anything they would regret. And while I find their talk about the population or workers tedious, I can understand their point. My ponies need organisation, and it seems these unions can provide me just that. And they, clearly, wish to exist in their own ideology from before. At least they are not as radical as some others I have seen, so that's a plus.\n\nWhile our current discussion was a success, we've yet much to do before there's any real fruition. But I must say, I am pleasantly surprised."
jungle.9.a:0 "Reasonable ponies all in all"

jungle.10.t:0 "Meeting The Paramount Chiefs"
jungle.10.d:0 "I once studied these southern tribes, my intent was to turn profit. I fled here to turn profit, but my time here taught me much. I made a powerful and a very loyal ally among these tribes, and they had my back. I feel foolish for simply using them to meet my ends.\n\nFortunately, they are the forgiving kind, they understand that without me, they would be in a much worse state than they are now. I brought them gifts, as a token of my gratitude for our alliance, little did I know they had more on their mind for the celebration.\n\nThey greet me like a hero, and now, a feast is in order."
jungle.10.a:0 "Glad we still have their support"

jungle.11.t:0 "In The Jungle"
jungle.11.d:0 "While we have defeated our enemies in open battle, it is under the cover of the jungle that they keep fighting us, attacking villages in the darkness, smashing convoys and terrorising the civilians. The thestrals that lived under them still do not trust us, but that may yet be changed.\n\nI deem it unsafe to venture into the jungle without a gun, that is what I told my ponies to do as well. I did not seek an end to this war to continue with the slaughter of the innocents now. We've grown accustomed to the jungle way of life, we'll smoke them out, one way or another.\n\nThe howling shrieks echo every night, it cannot continue like this much longer. Things must change, and change soon. I can't have my ponies live in constant fear because of some terrorists in the woods, I will null this insufferable insurgency."
jungle.11.a:0 "We'll beat them eventually..."

jungle.12.t:0 "The Federation"
jungle.12.d:0 "A small state we once were, but those days are long over. We've fought a war, we've earned our freedom, no more we are a rogue state, now, we're a proper state, a country, we are Aztlan. A jungle, we have conquered, we made new allies who still stand by our side, all to be able to proudly say that we are free.\n\nI've assessed our current state, while not in mint condition, I vow to make it right. We've threats within, I will tend to them with a firm hoof, there will be no terror in Aztlan.\n\nAnd so, I, Caballeron, proclaim Aztlan to be a federation, we will stand proud next to one another. Our cause is just, our ponies, noble, it is not the question of survival anymore, now, it's disciple and order. The days of refuge are over."
jungle.12.a:0 "Long live Aztlan!"

jungle.13.t:0 "The Red Folder"
jungle.13.d:0 "Few wish to recall the recent events, this war didn't bring much good to any of us. It is with this in mind that I have decided that it's time to put aside our differences for once. To pardon our enemies is a great virtue, one that I do not give lightly.\n\nI put great expectations on this partnership, even if I'm not completely convinced. Peace is a greater virtue that I seek, we can have no peace without trust, so trust them I must.\n\nThey welcome my forgiveness, tell me how they hope we'll work well together. I hope for such myself, it's good to have allies in these times. I need more friends and not foes in here."
jungle.13.a:0 "A nice change of pace"

jungle.14.t:0 "Lifting The Union Ban"
jungle.14.d:0 "After observing and cooperating with the unions for some time, I have decided that it's time to lift the union ban. They've applied good organisation in my cities, which is a reassuring feeling. I'm glad the plan comes together.\n\nWith that in place, the discontent grows weaker, so I'm sure we're on a steady road to find stability once more. My subjects will live well, a life they deserve, a life I will give them.\n\nThere were no indicators so far that my trust in unions was misplaced, it better stay that way."
jungle.14.a:0 "Let's hope they won't cause too many issues"

jungle.15.t:0 "The Stallionist Trials"
jungle.15.d:0 "All the atrocities of the war keep surfacing like rotten fish in a stream. While I intend to cooperate with the socialists, radicalism will not stand in my presence. I've had my eye on these Stallionists, but their time is up.\n\nJustice is served this day, the terrorists will pay for their crimes. They've long sat in their cells, still unwilling to give up their diehard and fanatical beliefs. It must end now, they will be made an example of.\n\nLavender Berry, you stand accused of crimes against ponykind, for which you will pay with your blood. Kneel down and accept your fate!"
jungle.15.a:0 "Guilty as charged!"

jungle.16.t:0 "Socialist Parties Unbanned"
jungle.16.d:0 "With the progress made in regards to cooperation with the socialists, it seems they deliver on their promises. I must say, Cricket Chafer has proven to be a valuable asset, and it is time I complete my end of the bargain.\n\nI will allow socialist parties to exist in Aztlan, consider this to be my token of trust and gratitude. So longer that my ponies get to exist in peace and order.\n\nI am looking forward to our mutual existence."
jungle.16.a:0 "Just don't let it get out of hoof"

jungle.17.t:0 "The Native Language Act"
jungle.17.d:0 "The tribes have been the biggest aid in the forepassed conflict, but they will not be bygone. I have given them a promise to preserve and respect their culture, and that is what I will do. I am proud to be called their icniuhtli, and no friend of mine will be forgotten.\n\nI decree that the languages of the ponies native to these jungles are to be considered official languages of Aztlan. Any document, plea, decree or communication in them is to be considered valid and to be accepted. I welcome our allies with a big heart.\n\nLet's hope this doesn't get too complicated."

### Leader descs
JUN_doctor_desc:0 "Born in Puerto Caballo, Caballeron has long been a student of archeology, fascinated by the cultures, languages and history of southeastern Equestria. To fund his studies, he sold artifacts he found, sometimes to rather questionable individuals. This proved to be worth it as he eventually graduated with a Doctor's degree, despite Daring Do, his arch-nemesis, often trying to intervene and rescue the relics before he could sell them.\n\nAfter the Equestrian Civil War began, Caballeron used the wealth he had acquired from the sale of artifacts to hire mercenaries and drove out the Lunarist forces from the region around Tenochtitlan. He claims to be defending the natives, though some doubt if his motives are truly honest."

This proved to be worth it as he eventually graduated with a Doctor's degree, despite Daring Do, his arch-nemesis, often trying to intervene and rescue the relics before he could sell them.\n\nAfter he founded the Aztlan State in the southeast, Caballeron has worked hard to create a free federation where everybody's rights are guaranteed. Despite his background, he has proven himself as an honest leader who genuinely cares for the natives. Thus he earned the trust of [EQS.GetLeader], much to the dismay of Daring Do."
