### Focuses ###
JUN_decleration:0 "Stuck in a Strange Land"
JUN_decleration_desc:0 "Due to unforeseen circumstances it seems that we are in fact stuck running a country, in the middle of a jungle filled with dangerous fauna, flora, tribals, crazy cultists and annoying adventurers... but if we play our cards right perhaps we can still turn a profit here."
JUN_we_need_a_port:0 "Repurpose Saltmane"
JUN_we_need_a_port_desc:0 "Saltmane Coast is a splendid territory, but we require more than simple jungles and beaches for our war efforts. We shall turn this area into our primary port, to protect ourselves from sea threats as well."
JUN_we_need_the_guns:0 "Call In A Few Favours"
JUN_we_need_the_guns_desc:0 "The instability we face is not one to be taken lightly. Our assets are low, our stance, feeble. However, it will soon change. The means of combat is a small favour to ask in order to achieve control. There's no profit to be made if we can't even defend ourselves."
JUN_we_need_even_more:0 "And Then Some"
JUN_we_need_even_more_desc:0 "The dangers are always afoot, if we intend to stand a chance, more weapons are required. It's time we further increase our stockpile of armaments. Guns, grenades, ammunition, anything a soldier can need."
JUN_the_wealth_of_the_jungle:0 "The Riches of Aztlan"
JUN_the_wealth_of_the_jungle_desc:0 "This land is rich with goods and treasures, we need only be able to excavate them. I, Caballeron, demand quarries to be developed, lands will be razed and trees to be cut, the resources are everywhere, and they will be ours."
JUN_dedicated_smugglers:0 "Blockade Runners"
JUN_dedicated_smugglers_desc:0 "They think they can contain us in here, limit our income. This territory is ours now, and we'll use it to our advantage. Let's show them who controls these jungles, and who can smuggle through them better."
JUN_fortify_technochitlan:0 "Rebuild The Walls Of Tenochtitlan"
JUN_fortify_technochitlan_desc:0 "Tenochtitlan was once a fortress, an impenetrable bastion with great walls which none could surmount. We must rebuild them, that will provide us with a strategic standpoint and a defensive position, should such need arise. And perhaps, the locals will feel more accepting of our presence here."
JUN_reuse_the_ruins:0 "Repurpose the Ruins"
JUN_reuse_the_ruins_desc:0 "The Ruins here are old, crumbling, but they can still provide a solid foundation. We shall repurpose them for our own needs, build our structures upon the ancient land, there will be a stronghold raised here in no time, such is my will."
JUN_repair_the_cannals:0 "Repair The Canals"
JUN_repair_the_cannals_desc:0 "Rivers are a fickle landmark, wild and unpredictable, but if we can tame it, it will become our advantage. Repair the old canals, so that the water will provide us with resources, the river will become our line of transport and the shores will be our enemies' nightmare."
JUN_food_surplus:0 "Stock The Pantries"
JUN_food_surplus_desc:0 "Our supplies come steadily and surely, it is time to replenish our stocks. Load the pantries, let none of our supplies perish, or worse, get into our enemies' clutches. There will always be a good use for it later, our ponies will need it."
JUN_the_old_road:0 "Repair The Ohtli System"
JUN_the_old_road_desc:0 "So many things in here are still in half-decent state. They may not be of good use right now, but if we are to invest into renovations of these roads and structures, our infrastructure will flourish, just as these jungles do."
JUN_secondary_forts:0 "Raise The Towers"
JUN_secondary_forts_desc:0 "With all the elements I put in place, we're still exposed and scattered among these woods. Raise the towers! Our sight will span far and wide, none shall take us by surprise! These fortified constructions will bestow upon us a gratifying sense of security."
JUN_repair_the_temple:0 "Repair the Tonaltzintli Pyramid"
JUN_repair_the_temple_desc:0 "The culture and architecture of these locals is fascinating, the Tonaltzintli Pyramid is a prime example of an excellent edifice of the Neighua tribe. Though turned to a decrepit state with time, this temple may return to its former glory yet. May it inspire us well and provide refuge from the raging war. My only hope is that the chiefs can share my enthusiasm."
JUN_basic_manufacturies:0 "Tenochtitlan Manufacturies"
JUN_basic_manufacturies_desc:0 "With all the progress I've made to develop the framework here, the time has come to move to the next level. Our capital requires better factories, better production. We can finally set up a progressive manufacturing base here, the likes of which this land has not yet seen before."
JUN_basic_saw_mills:0 "Logging Camps"
JUN_basic_saw_mills_desc:0 "The jungles have no shortage of wood. Yet to harvest it more effectively, we need better tools and groundwork to support such activities. Build more sawmills, our logging camps will yield materials to the brim, we shall never run out of fine wood again."
JUN_win_them_over:0 "Meet With The Natives"
JUN_win_them_over_desc:0 "Perhaps these locals can be of use to us. After all, they're the natives here, it would be foolish to fight against them and not alongside them. We must organise a meeting, I know a way into their heart, there is a chance that they will listen to me."
JUN_hearts_and_minds:0 "Hearts And Minds"
JUN_hearts_and_minds_desc:0 "We must further our relationship with the Neighua. A fight for survival can unite anyone, and this is our chance. They may be dangerous, but if we sway them to our side, our cause, the dangers they present can become our tactical advantage."
JUN_borne_of_the_jungle:0 "Borne Of The Dark"
JUN_borne_of_the_jungle_desc:0 "With our agreements in place, our newfound allies entrusted us some of their best and most trained warriors. It is a great honour, and an opportunity that we must cherish. I welcome them, our partners will thrive, and our enemies will learn to fear these jungles."
JUN_bury_them_here:0 "Masters Of The Jungle"
JUN_bury_them_here_desc:0 "Our partnership allowed us to learn these territories in their greatest details. Every nook and cranny that these locals have lived among for ages, their secrets, are now part of our intelligence. Ultimately, it seems this ally has become our greatest asset yet."
JUN_the_chosen:0 "Chosen By The Gods"
JUN_the_chosen_desc:0 "Their culture is a curious one. Odd, but has its uses, perhaps I underestimated them. They wish to offer us to be chosen by the Gods. Such tales are quaint, but the ferocity and cunning of these ponies is undeniable. We shall take them on their offer, it is bound to help our relationship in the future."
JUN_the_final_push:0 "Fight For Aztlan"
JUN_the_final_push_desc:0 "After all we've gone through, I never gave up, we never gave up, and never will. These jungles were a dangerous place, full of perils on every step. They still are, but thanks to our allies, it is only our enemies that see them as such. The Neighua and their culture, their knowledge, is part of our own now. We are free, and this is our land now, we will fight for it as if it were our own. Now, we are home. For Aztlan!"

### Events ###
jungle.1.t:0 "The Paramount Chiefs"
jungle.1.d:0 "One is never sure what to expect when they meet the local tribes whose lands you come into. I studied them, but I can't be ready for everything. Will they be savage? Will they ambush us? Will they want to work together with us? Though, it still gives me hope that they agreed to this meeting. We're not in the best position to bargain right now.\n\nYet still, despite all the possible issues, the chiefs were friendly to us. Perhaps, they appreciate the respect I tried to show for their culture, or they simply realise that the war closing in around us can threaten their peace as well as their stability, or even their well-being. The summit was a success, and they will aid us find our place in these jungles, while we will offer them protection.\n\nWhile their strings were easy to pull, they made themselves clear, they will cooperate, on the condition that we respect their customs, their tradition and their culture. A small price to pay for the shelter of an ancient and powerful ally who know the landscape better than any one us ever will."
jungle.1.a:0 "I'm glad we are working together"

jungle.2.t:0 "Hearts And Minds"
jungle.2.d:0 "It seems that both of us came to the same conclusion, a misfortune united us, but it is I who will turn it into our fortune. Same as us, they see the great benefit of our cooperation, we provide them with a barrier, better infrastructure and the possibility to rebuild their long lost greatness, the structures that were beaten and eroded with time, the harsh jungle weather and the previous occupants. While on their end, they give is insight on the landscape, the safe paths, the dangerous glades and even some hidden treasures.\n\nIt was an underestimation from my side, what they're capable of. A frail mistake, to doubt them, but that doesn't matter now, for our hearts and minds are focused on the same purpose, survival.\n\nWe shall see how our mutual future will turn out, but for now, this alliance proves itself to be a promising treat."
jungle.2.a:0 "Aztlan shall be free!"

jungle.3.t:0 "Conflicts of Interest"
jungle.3.d:0 "It appears that our local friends are not too happy with the recent expansion of our logging efforts. Soon after the new mills started toppling the glades and piling the wood, the chiefs called us for an emergency meeting.\n\nThey were adamant about the value of land for them, the resources it provided, a relationship that should not be overstepped. They looked at me with a lightning glare, but their dissatisfaction still finished with only puffs and grunts, as they did not take any major actions about it.\n\nWhile resources are required, I did not want to show signs of weakness. Neighua do not like weakness, that I know well. However, we can only hope that they do understand the purpose of our actions, the enormous war effort that we carry, and forgive us for it. I may be harsh, but I think I was too harsh this time. Hm, I shall yet rebuild their jungle sweep and wide."
jungle.3.a:0 "Rather unfortunate"

jungle.4.t:0 "Squatter Troubles"
jungle.4.d:0 "Our continued effort to gather more resources has attracted new interest to our territories. Not all of it, however, I can call positive and useful. A problem arose out of it, the squatters started taking up more and more of our space.\n\nOne can only wonder where do they even come from, but riches, or even better, commodities, do appear to have that effect. The surrounding areas of our pantries is more like slums for poor and adventurers alike now. They don't seem to have the intention to leave, either.\n\nThough I need to focus on my own kind first, this pest do not seem to be all that harmful, other than to our supplies and reputation, yet we cannot ignore them.\n\nThere is strength in numbers, we have enough resources, I'll find a use for these lackeys. Unlike the sun, the work never sets at the horizon, there's always more of it. If they wish to stay, they will stay, but first they'll earn their bread."
jungle.4.a:0 "At least we can put them to work..."

jungle.5.t:0 "The Wonders of Irrigation"
jungle.5.d:0 "Oh, water, a crucial resource for any civilisation, and these jungles are abundant with it. From humidity to rivers, sometimes I wish there was less of it. But by taming the flow of the river, we can utilise it to suit our every need.\n\nOur fields bloom, our citizens thrive, all thanks to the improved infrastructure. Truly a display of our power and a victory for our well-being. The influence we exert on this realm only grows.\n\nAhh, the wonders of irrigation. "
jungle.5.a:0 "Ain't it beautiful?"

jungle.6.t:0 "An Amazing Discovery"
jungle.6.d:0 "Restoring the old ruins was no easy task, I knew that myself. The stones, old, crude, uneven, are hard to work with. I feared that this whole operation will be more woeful than it would be profitable.\n\nUntil, one day, we hit upon a secret chamber in one of the ruins' catacombs compartments. It was filled with riches beyond my imagination, and this time, no pesky adventurers to stop me from claiming what is mine. The locals were right when they told us to investigate this place. I can only wonder if perhaps, they wanted us to find these? Nevertheless, the discovery raised the spirits of the ponies, and it seemed as if all the previous inconveniences simply vanished and the work continued without a hitch.\n\nWith all the new structures in place, and the fresh treasures in our vaults, this province starts looking all the more promising to me."
jungle.6.a:0 "Gold, gems, and more!"

jungle.7.t:0 "Native Complaints"
jungle.7.d:0 "The war is looming on us all, and we are in no way having an advantageous predicament in it yet. The fight has weakened us, drained us of our resources, hit our morale. I'm afraid it is time for more desperate measures.\n\nWe have resorted to calling in a few favours with the natives, which allowed us to gather more equipment for the war machine that we must guide now. Weapons, supplies, anything goes, so long that it helps us take an edge in the conflict we face.\n\nUnfortunately, the natives were not satisfied with our actions and demands. But they will understand the inevitability of the situation and the price it carries."

### Leader descs
JUN_doctor_desc:0 "Born in Puerto Caballo, Caballeron has long been a student of archeology, fascinated by the cultures, languages and history of southeastern Equestria. To fund his studies, he sold artifacts he found, sometimes to rather questionable individuals. This proved to be worth it as he eventually graduated with a Doctor's degree, despite Daring Do, his arch-nemesis, often trying to intervene and rescue the relics before he could sell them.\n\nAfter the Equestrian Civil War began, Caballeron used the wealth he had acquired from the sale of artifacts to hire mercenaries and drove out the Lunarist forces from the region around Tenochtitlan. He claims to be defending the natives, though some doubt if his motives are truly honest."

This proved to be worth it as he eventually graduated with a Doctor's degree, despite Daring Do, his arch-nemesis, often trying to intervene and rescue the relics before he could sell them.\n\nAfter he founded the Aztlan State in the southeast, Caballeron has worked hard to create a free federation where everybody's rights are guaranteed. Despite his background, he has proven himself as an honest leader who genuinely cares for the natives. Thus he earned the trust of [EQS.GetLeader], much to the dismay of Daring Do."
