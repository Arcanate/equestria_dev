#### LEADERS ####
SKYNAVIAN_GENERAL_CONGRESS_NAME:0 "Skynavian General Congress"
SKYNAVIAN_GENERAL_CONGRESS_NAME_DESC:0 "The governing body of the Socialist Republic of Skynavia since its formation, the Skynavian General Congress is made up of 80 delegates representing their respective constituencies. These delegates are nominated from amidst their communities and democratically elected to serve short terms, with each term usually being one-third of a year, and can be reelected for a maximum of three terms. Because these delegates are held responsible to represent the opinions of their constituenciesm they are subject to immediate recall and replacement if the General Congress undertakes decisions unfavourable to their constituency.\n\nThis system of governance ensures that power remains decentralised at the behest of the people by way of preventing the formation of a politican caste. Although sometimes inefficient by being staffed with amateurs at statescraft, the General Congress can proudly lay claim to being the most democratic institution in all of Griffonia, and even Equus as well."

#### IDEAS ####
#"Borne into a world wracked by war and chaos, the Griffonian Socialist Republic has weathered many trials and tribulations. With the monarchist counterrevolution, the Socialists fled northwards with their erstwhile Republican allies."
SRS_young_chick:0 "Emilia Stalwart"
SRS_young_chick_desc:0 "Born to a pair of determined socialist revolutionaries from the Heartlands, Emilia Stalwart was only a child when the Skynavia SR was established. Having experienced an education couched in socialist ideology, Emilia nevertheless was not satisfied with her life in Skynavia, instead choosing to go visit the capitalist countries of the south when she graduated.\n\nHaving experienced firsthand the depredations of capitalism, authoritarianism, and monarchism during her travels, she has now returned to her home an ardent internationalist, carrying within her an immutable resolve to change the world for the better."
communalist_manufacturing:0 "Skynavian Manufacturing Cooperative"
internationalist_armaments:0 "International Revolutionary Armaments"
SRS_the_general_congress:0 "The General Congress of the Skynavia SR"
SRS_the_general_congress_desc:0 "The General Congress is the governing body of Skynavia, where otherwise normal citizens from electoral constituencies all over the country are nominated by their communities as delegates, and if successfully voted in, serve roughly 4-month terms representing their constituency at the Congress. This system is democratic and open, and ensures that no individual, clique, or political faction is able to dominate Skynavian politics.\n\nThe ever-changing makeup of the Congress, and the lack of political acumen of its delegates, means that Congressional proceedings are oftentimes circuitous, as every motion and proposal is scrutinised and discussed exhaustively. This is viewed as an acceptable price to pay for the democracy and liberty of the Skynavian people."

SRS_the_1007_conference_of_the_usrf_desc:0 "The world is becoming an increasingly hostile place towards socialism. The forces of reaction, rotten and stagnant as they are, threaten to plunge the continent into warfare and chaos at the behest of the profit-motive. We must discuss the geopolitical situation at hand in order to face the impending challenges of the future."
SRS_debates_1a:0 "Socialism and Progress"
SRS_debates_1a_desc:0 "The Internationalists have argued for a policy of efficient and productive industrialisation. We must seek to strengthen ourselves militarily, socially, and industrially if we are to carry on the revolution and liberate the rest of Griffonia. We must not forget the reason for our exile, and so must fight to return to our homeland as liberators as soon as possible, by all means possible."
SRS_debates_1b:0 "Socialism and the Earth"
SRS_debates_1b_desc:0 "The Communalists have argued for a policy of highly-restrained industrialisation, emphasising a respect for the land and its inhabitants, with strict limits on the environmental pollution and ecological devastation that inevitably follow industrialisation. After all, we live here now and so shall our children, and so we must strive to be better than the polluting capitalists down south."
SRS_debates_1c:0 "Power to the People"
SRS_debates_1c_desc:0 "In the Skynavia SR, where control over local industry is highly decentralised, standards of living vary between the Republic's different constituencies, from the urban heart of New Skynavia, to the anarcho-primitivist communes of the Hail Forest. We must make sure that such basic necessities as water and electricity are available to those communities that want them."
SRS_debates_1d:0 "The Collectivisation of Technology"
SRS_debates_1d_desc:0 "Unlike the decadent bourgeois societies of the Heartlands, Aquileia, or Wingbardy, where the rich enjoy the fruits of technological prowess whilst the poor starve in their hovels nearby, the people of Skynavia shall have equal access to whatever technological advances made by their brethren. Our technological marvels may be few, but they will serve the many, not the few."
SRS_debates_1e:0 "The Liberation of Science"
SRS_debates_1e_desc:0 "The opportunity to work towards the advancement of science should be open to all who desire it. The foundation of a People's University shall make it so that science shall no longer be confined within the realms of the bourgeoisie, the military, and the industrialists, and instead become an aspiration accessible to the inquisitive masses."
SRS_debates_2a:0 "Democracy through Centralism"
SRS_debates_2a_desc:0 "We must institute the tenets of Democratic Centralism within the USRF, where political policy is decided through universal suffrage, and the outcome of the vote is binding on all party members. We must stand in unity against factionalism in order to achieve our revolutionary aspirations."
SRS_debates_2b:0 "Democracy through Confederalism"
SRS_debates_2b_desc:0 "We must move past the myopic statism of authoritarian nationalism, and instead pursue a radical democracy where differing political tendencies can coexist in harmony without conflict. We reject the suppressive orthodoxy of party uniformity, organising along horizontal hierarchies where a direct democracy of the masses can thrive."
SRS_debates_2c:0 "The Charter of The Republic"
SRS_debates_2c_desc:0 "Taking inspiration from the social contracts of the autonomous communes, we shall draft a constitution for our Republic to codify our libertarian and democratic ideals."
SRS_debates_2d:0 "Giving Voice to the Masses"
SRS_debates_2d_desc:0 "The right to take part in direct democracy is already available to the Skynavian citizen, who has access to the weekly assemblies of their local People's Council. The proliferation of radio technology will make it so that everybody anywhere will be able to listen in to and indirectly partake in the meetings of the General Congress taking place in New Skynavia."
SRS_debates_2e:0 "The Democratization of Knowledge"
SRS_debates_2e_desc:0 "We must make sure that the right to a decent and comprehensive education is fulfilled for the people of Skynavia. Schools will be opened where there are none, volunteer teachers will be trained, night courses be made available to the workers, and soon education will be made accessible to all."
SRS_debates_3a:0 "The Revolution of the People"
SRS_debates_3a_desc:0 "Dogmatic party vanguardism begets authoritarianism, where the wishes of the people are subverted to the demands of psuedo-colonial interventions in foreign nations. We must not forget our responsibility to lead the people of Skynavia towards a libertarian socialist future!"
SRS_debates_3b:0 "The Internationalist Vanguard"
SRS_debates_3b_desc:0 "To indulge in societal experimentation at home whilst our brothers and sisters suffer under the capitalist yoke is the highest form of self-indulgent decadence. We have a responsibility to liberate our kin in the name of socialism, and must act accordingly!"
SRS_debates_3c:0 "A Permanent Revolution"
SRS_debates_3c_desc:0 "Both sides of the USRF agree on the need for a so-called 'Permanent Revolution', but what this actually entails is up for debate. It is time for the Front to decide what to make of its namesake."
SRS_debates_3d:0 "The Machinery of Socialism"
SRS_debates_3d_desc:0 "The Internationalists contend that the focus of our industry should be geared towards the provision of armaments for the international socialist revolution, whilst the Communalists insist on first improving the standard of living at home. We shall put this to a vote at the General Congress."
SRS_debates_3e:0 "The Harbingers of Revolution"
SRS_debates_3e_desc:0 "We must remind the world of the incipient socialist revolution! Such a declaration will assert the prosperity of the Skynavia SR and recapitulate our solidarity with our oppressed brethren abroad." 
SRS_war_tree:0 "The War in the North"
SRS_war_tree_desc:0 "Right on our doorstep are the feudalistic Northern Tribes, who have warred against us since the foundation of the Skynavia SR, and incessant petty skirmishes on the border continued to claim the lives of our brave fighters. Something must be done to put an end to this meaningless conflict."
SRS_war_1:0 "Galvanise Our Fighters"
SRS_war_1_desc:0 "We need to rally our friends and family on the home front in order to support our fighters slugging it out with the ponies in the frozen wastes."
SRS_war_2:0 "Galvanise Our Enemies"
SRS_war_2_desc:0 "The ponies we are fighting against are members of an oppressed social group, misled into dying for their feudal overlords. We should send a delegation to try and negotiate an end to the conflict with the Northern Tribes, or failing that, instigate the tribal ponies into rebellion."
SRS_war_3:0 "Ending the Conflict"
SRS_war_3_desc:0 "The feudalistic Northern Tribe is no more. Having freed the tribesponies from their shackles, we must now allow them their freedom to rebuild and remould their society in the socialist image. Of course, we will be there to help them through this difficult transition."
SRS_war_4:0 "From the Ashes of Feudalism..."
SRS_war_4_desc:0 "We have the responsibility to share with our comrades up north all our technological prowess, so they too may benefit, as our brothers and sisters in the revolutionary cause, from the fruits of socialist progress."
SRS_war_5:0 "The Sister Republic Arises!"
SRS_war_5_desc:0 "At the culmination of a great deal of hard work, perseverance, and sacrifice, both on our part and by our pony brethren up north, we have succeeded in developing the territories of the former Northern Tribes through the doctrine of socialism. By democratic vote, the Far Northern Republic shall be established to herald a new era of socialism in the North!"
SRS_military_tree:0 "The Skynavian People's Army"
SRS_military_tree_desc:0 "That the army of Skynavia belongs to the people is indisputable. Already, the most talented commanders of our volunteer militias have developed various tactics suited for the decentralised light-infantry formations of the People's Army for guerilla fighting in arctic weather conditions."
SRS_military_1:0 "Autonomous People's Militias"
SRS_military_1_desc:0 "Further doctrinal and organisational development of the system of autonomous communal militias will best serve the interests of the Skynavian people."
SRS_military_2:0 "Proletarian Revolutionary Guard"
SRS_military_2_desc:0 "How will we be able to export the revolution when we lack the military means to do so? The Proletarian Revolutionary Guard will be formed in order to protect and advance the interests of the International Socialist Revolution, at home and abroad."
SRS_military_3:0 "Armouries of the People"
SRS_military_3_desc:0 "We must cement the control of the people over the means of self-defence, so they will be able to protect their homes against foreign invasion should the occasion arise."
SRS_military_4:0 "Popular Control of the Military"
SRS_military_4_desc:0 "The military must remain subordinate to the will of the people if the ideals of democratic socialism are to be preserved throughout all aspects of the Skynavian SR. A horizontalised command structure will be integral to preserving democracy both within and outside of the military."
SRS_military_5:0 "Centralised Command Structure"
SRS_military_5_desc:0 "Discipline is the glue that holds the military together. The militias of the communes can enjoy their autonomy, but the powers of the military high command must be strengthened if we want to fight and win in the revolutionary struggle to come."
SRS_military_a:0 "The Strong Arm of the Revolution"
SRS_military_a_desc:0 "The advent of armoured tank combat taking place on Equus and Griffonia heralds the beginning of a new age of warfare. The potency of this new aspect of war should not be overlooked, and hence we must pursue development immediately."
SRS_military_b:0 "The Long Arm of the Revolution"
SRS_military_b_desc:0 "Socialism on the High Seas! The socialist revolution shall take to the waves in order to liberate the proletariat of the nations across the ocean in Equus. More importantly, a navy allows us to keep our coastline safe and defend our home from seaborne invasion."
SRS_industry_tree:0 "Consolidate the Means of Production"
SRS_industry_tree_desc:0 "In Skynavia, there are no bosses or capitalists, and the people work for the betterment of society under no coercion or forced labour. The Means of Production are already in the hands of the proletariat, and so we can now focus on a measured and sustainable industrialisation."
SRS_industry_1:0 "Autonomous Cooperatives"
SRS_industry_1_desc:0 "The first thing we should do is to formalise the status of the many autonomous cooperatives found all across Skynavia. While the management structure, scope, and scale of these cooperatives vary greately, they are all united in their egalitarian approach to producing value out of their labour."
SRS_industry_2:0 "Independent Workers' Councils"
SRS_industry_2_desc:0 "The concept of workers' councils may be a holdover from when labour was still controlled by the capitalists, but these councils still serve an invaluable function to Skynavian democracy by allowing for an independent grassroots organisation of the masses."
SRS_industry_3:0 "By the People, For the People"
SRS_industry_3_desc:0 "There is little sense to maintain the concept of private ownership over land, considering the lack of capitalist predation on the livelihoods of the proletariat in Skynavian society. We should encourage and propagate the idea of the public's shared responsibility to maintain and make use of the land in the communities, for the common good."
SRS_industry_4:0 "Feeding the People"
SRS_industry_4_desc:0 "The icy tundras making up most of Skynavia are hardly suited to agriculture. But by working together and applying agrarian socialist concepts to the development of arable land, the spirit of solidarity and perseverance shall soon allow us to achieve a hard-earned autarky."
SRS_industry_5:0 "Educating the People"
SRS_industry_5_desc:0 "By creating a network of communal schools, forming an organisation of travelling specialists, and writing up new school curriculums that allow for greater freedom and personal development, we will soon be able to bring education to the people of Skynavia efficiently and on a large scale."
SRS_industry_a:0 "Arming the People"
SRS_industry_a_desc:0 "Attention should be paid to the construction of communal armouries and gunsmiths, so each community, collective, and commune within Skynavia will each be capable of protecting their homes themselves."
SRS_industry_b:0 "Nurturing the People"
SRS_industry_b_desc:0 "The development gap between the urbanised areas of New Skynavia and the independent communes filling up the rest of Skynavia must be addressed. Groups of volunteers from the city, bringing with them their expertise, as well as all sorts of machinery and raw material, shall pursue intensive development within the communes dotting the banks of the Skynavia river delta."
SRS_diplomacy_tree:0 "Socialism In Our Time"
SRS_diplomacy_tree_desc:0 "It is essential for all the socialist nations of the world to be united in our shared fight for the international revolution and the liberation of our oppressed comrades abroad. By sending delegates to socialist nations abroad, we will take the first step in creating the bonds of brotherhood between the free nations of the world."
SRS_diplomacy_1:0 "Our Brothers in Arms"
SRS_diplomacy_1_desc:0 "The benevolence of the monarchist rule in Vedina does not hide the fact that it is still an instrument of class oppression that has created and actively maintains an unjust status quo. We must decide now on how to intervene in Vedina to liberate its proletariat from the shackles of feudalism and monarchism."
SRS_diplomacy_2:0 "Our Comrades in Need"
SRS_diplomacy_2_desc:0 "Decades ago, we had split with the Republicans in Cloudsbury over their refusal to share power with the people they profess to be liberating. Their centralisation of power within an exclusive cadre of the military cost them the support of the people, contributing to the failure of the First Griffonian Revolution. We must reclaim the revolutionary ideal for the proletariat by bringing to heel the militaristic warlords."
SRS_diplomacy_3:0 "Internationalist Brigades"
SRS_diplomacy_3_desc:0 "Both sides of the Congress have agreed on a policy where foreign fighters for the revolutionary socialist cause are to be welcomed to the Skynavia SR as fellow comrades and brothers in arms. These volunteers will fight in our Internationalist Brigades. The first of these Brigades to be created will be the Lions of Skynavia, formed by the hardened veterans of many a socialist insurrection abroad."
SRS_diplomacy_4:0 "Friendship of Species"
SRS_diplomacy_4_desc:0 "Taking the concept of the Internationalist Brigades to the next level, we will now start recruiting revolutionaries of different races from Equus and Griffonia, allowing them to fight in specialist units that make the best out of the physiological advantages of their respective races."
SRS_diplomacy_5:0 "Welcome the Exiles"
SRS_diplomacy_5_desc:0 "Three prominent revolutionaries - Emma Goldgriff, Mikhail Beakunin, and Pierre Proudpone - once departed from the Skynavia SR a long time ago, citing the lack of action to liberate the oppressed of our neighbouring countries. Now that we have accomplished what seemed impossible a few decades ago, we can invite our exiled comrades back home."
SRS_peace_and_plenty:0 "§HThe Land of Peace And Plenty§!"
SRS_peace_and_plenty_desc:0 "With the culmination of our democratically-driven industrialisation, the Skynavia SR is slowly and surely transitioning into a socialist utopia. The internationalists and communalists may have their differences, but in the end we have learnt to work together in the spirit of true socialist solidarity and brotherhood. In Skynavia, everyone are brothers and sisters to each other in our great socialist family."

SRS_elections_timer_desc:0 "Three times each year, free elections are held where the citizens of the Skynavian SR choose a delegate from their midst to represent their community at the General Congress of the USRF. These delegates, who are subject to immediate recall and replacement from their communities, serve on the Congress for a term limited to three election cycles, after which they must step down — that is, if they have managed to retain their position for the three consecutive cycles, which hardly happens.\n\nThe outcome of the elections are mainly based on the decisions of the Internationalists and Communalists in between elections, where over-eager and too-frequent decision-making by either faction alienates those citizens of Skynavia most adversely affected by such decisions, thus loosing them their support.\n\nIt is very rare that either faction secures an overwhemling majority within the General Congress, as various checks and balances serve to maintain a stable power balance where no faction is able to permanently wield veto power over the Congress — such a situation would be quite undemocratic."

SRS_reconciliation_with_the_tribals_desc:0 "There exists within the Skynavia SR a population of dispossessed indigenous ponies. Existing outside of our socialist society, they receive none of the social benefits, voting rights, or personal freedoms taken for granted by proper citizens.\n\nBy giving these indigenes proper citizenship, we will be giving them access to a higher standard of living, and hopefully atone for our past expropriation of their land as well."

SRS_approach_hail_forest_communes_desc:0 "The sparsely-populated and undeveloped Hail Forest is home to dozens of autonomous communes, detached from the General Congress in New Skynavia and existing in a de-facto state of independence. Populated with agrarian socialists, anarchists, radical libertarians, former ecoteurs, and the like, these communes are the epitome of decentralised and nonhierarchical society.\n\nRegrettably, their combined resources and expertise are unavilable to the rest of the Skynavia SR due to their aloof isolation from the Republic, but they should be receptive towards occasional requests for temporary collaborative efforts."
SRS_form_the_free_womens_corps:0 "§MForm the Order of the Dames of Socialism§!"
SRS_form_the_free_womens_corps_desc:0 "The social emancipation allowed by socialism demands the liberation of the marginalised on all fronts. One aspect of such liberation is that of the female gender, who have historically bore the brunt of patriarchal misogyny.\n\nBy creating an independent corps exclusive to female citizens, we will hopefully be able to empower them to fight for the liberation of their sex at home and abroad.\n\nThe Internationalists have criticised this decision as the exacerbation of identity politics, but you can't please everyone..."

The honoured military general Asper Sickleclaw will be temporarily given dictatorial powers in the hopes that such strong central leadership will lead our nation through the current conflict.\n\nOf course, such an undemocratic centralisation of power will be unpopular with the vast majority of Skynavian citizens, and they will only tolerate such a situation for a limited period of time before calling for the reinstatement of the General Congress, no matter the geopolitical circumstances."
