SRS_the_1007_conference_of_the_usrf:0 "The 1007 Conference of the USRF"
SRS_debates_1a:0 "Socialism and Progress"
SRS_debates_1a_desc:0 "The Internationalists have argued for a policy of efficient and productive industrialisation. We must seek to strengthen ourselves militarily, socially, and industrially if we are to carry on the revolution and liberate the rest of Griffonia. We must not forget the reason for our exile, and so must fight to return to our homeland as liberators as soon as possible, by all means possible."
SRS_debates_1b:0 "Socialism and the Earth"
SRS_debates_1b_desc:0 "The Communalists have argued for a policy of highly-restrained industrialisation, emphasising a respect for the land and its inhabitants, with strict limits on the environmental pollution and ecological devastation that inevitably follow industrialisation. After all, we live here now and so shall our children, and so we must strive to be better than the polluting capitalists down south."
