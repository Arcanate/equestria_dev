#### FOCI ####
SRS_the_1007_conference_of_the_usrf:0 "The 1007 Conference of the USRF"
SRS_the_1007_conference_of_the_usrf_desc:0 "The world is becoming an increasingly hostile place towards socialism. The forces of reaction, rotten and stagnant as they are, threaten to plunge the continent into warfare and chaos at the behest of the profit-motive. We must discuss the geopolitical situation at hand in order to face the impending challenges of the future."
SRS_debates_1a:0 "Socialism and Progress"
SRS_debates_1a_desc:0 "The Internationalists have argued for a policy of efficient and productive industrialisation. We must seek to strengthen ourselves militarily, socially, and industrially if we are to carry on the revolution and liberate the rest of Griffonia. We must not forget the reason for our exile, and so must fight to return to our homeland as liberators as soon as possible, by all means possible."
SRS_debates_1b:0 "Socialism and the Earth"
SRS_debates_1b_desc:0 "The Communalists have argued for a policy of highly-restrained industrialisation, emphasising a respect for the land and its inhabitants, with strict limits on the environmental pollution and ecological devastation that inevitably follow industrialisation. After all, we live here now and so shall our children, and so we must strive to be better than the polluting capitalists down south."
SRS_debates_1c:0 "Power to the People"
SRS_debates_1d:0 "The Collectivisation of Technology"
SRS_debates_1e:0 "The Liberation of Science"
SRS_debates_2a:0 "Democracy through Centralism"
SRS_debates_2a_desc:0 "We must institute the tenets of Democratic Centralism within the USRF, where political policy is decided through universal suffrage, and the outcome of the vote is binding on all party members. We must stand in unity against factionalism in order to achieve our revolutionary aspirations."
SRS_debates_2b:0 "Democracy through Confederalism"
SRS_debates_2b_desc:0 "We must move past the myopic statism of authoritarian nationalism, and instead pursue a radical democracy where differing political tendencies can coexist in harmony without conflict. We reject the suppressive orthodoxy of party uniformity, organising along horizontal hierarchies where a direct democracy of the masses can thrive."
SRS_debates_2c:0 "The Charter of a Free People"
SRS_debates_2d:0 "Giving Voice to the Masses"
SRS_debates_2e:0 "The Democratization of Knowledge"
SRS_debates_3a:0 "The Revolution of the People"
SRS_debates_3a_desc:0 "Dogmatic party vanguardism begets authoritarianism, where the wishes of the people are subverted to the demands of psuedo-colonial interventions in foreign nations. We must not forget our responsibility to lead the people of Skynavia towards a libertarian socialist future!"
SRS_debates_3b:0 "The Internationalist Vanguard"
SRS_debates_3b_desc:0 "To indulge in societal experimentation at home whilst our brothers and sisters suffer under the capitalist yoke is the highest form of self-indulgent decadence. We have a responsibility to liberate our kin in the name of socialism, and must act accordingly!"
SRS_debates_3c:0 "A Permanent Revolution"
SRS_debates_3c_desc:0 "Both sides of the USRF agree on the need for a so-called 'Permanent Revolution', but what this actually entails is up for debate. It is time for the Front to decide what to make of its namesake."

#### DECISIONS ####
SRS_political_discussion:0 "@SRS The United Socialist Revolutionary Front @SRS "
SRS_political_discussion_desc:0 "During the monarchist counterrevolution, the myriad of socialist, communist, anarchist, and other leftist tendencies that fled north to Skynavia became united under the banner of the §YUnited Socialist Revolutionary Front§!, which democratically governs the Socialist Republic of Skynavia today.\n\nWith the Skynavia SR's governing body, the §YGeneral Congress§!, split between the Internationalists and Communalists, the Front must seek to accomodate both sides of its internal divide.\n\n§RInternationalist§! Delegates in the General Congress: [?internationalists_support_var|Y0]/80.\n\n§MCommunalist§! Delagates in the General Congress: [?communards_support_var|Y0]/80."
SRS_elections_timer:0 "§HThe Biannual Elections§!"
SRS_elections_timer_desc:0 "Twice each year, free elections are held where the citizens of the Skynavian SR choose a delegate from their midst to represent their community at the General Congress of the USRF. These delegates, who are subject to immediate recall and replacement from their communities, serve on the Congress for a term limited to three election cycles, after which they must step down — that is, if they have managed to retain their position for the three consecutive cycles, which hardly happens.\n\nThe outcome of the elections are mainly based on the decisions of the Internationalists and Communalists in between elections, where over-eager and too-frequent decision-making by either faction alienates those citizens of Skynavia most adversely affect by such decisions, thus loosing them their support.\n\nIt is very rare that either faction secures an overwhemling majority within the General Congress, as various checks and balances serve to maintain a stable power balance where no faction is able to permanently wield veto power over the Congress — such a situation would be quite undemocratic."
