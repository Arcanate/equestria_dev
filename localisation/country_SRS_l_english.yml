SRS_political_discussion_desc:0 "During the monarchist counterrevolution, the myriad of socialist, communist, anarchist, and other leftist tendencies that fled north to Skynavia became united under the banner of the United Socialist Revolutionary Front, which democratically governs the Socialist Republic of the Free Griffons today.\n\nSplit between the Internationalists and Communalists, the Front must seek to accomodate both sides of its internal divide.\n\nPopular Support for the Communalist Faction: [?communards_support_var|%+0].\n\nPopular Support for the Internationalist Faction: [?internationalists_support_var|%+0]."
