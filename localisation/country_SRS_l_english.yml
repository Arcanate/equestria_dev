#### LEADERS ####
SKYNAVIAN_GENERAL_CONGRESS_NAME:0 "Skynavian General Congress"
SKYNAVIAN_GENERAL_CONGRESS_NAME_DESC:0 "The governing body of the Socialist Republic of Skynavia since its formation, the Skynavian General Congress is made up of 80 delegates representing their respective constituencies. These delegates are nominated from amidst their communities and democratically elected to serve short terms, with each term usually being one-third of a year, and can be reelected for a maximum of three terms. Because these delegates are held responsible to represent the opinions of their constituenciesm they are subject to immediate recall and replacement if the General Congress undertakes decisions unfavourable to their constituency.\n\nThis system of governance ensures that power remains decentralised at the behest of the people by way of preventing the formation of a politican caste. Although sometimes inefficient by being staffed with amateurs at statescraft, the General Congress can proudly lay claim to being the most democratic institution in all of Griffonia, and even Equus as well."

#### IDEAS ####
#"Borne into a world wracked by war and chaos, the Griffonian Socialist Republic has weathered many trials and tribulations. With the monarchist counterrevolution, the Socialists fled northwards with their erstwhile Republican allies."
#"During the monarchist counterrevolution, the myriad of socialist, communist, anarchist, and other leftist tendencies that fled north to Skynavia became united under the banner of the §YUnited Socialist Revolutionary Front§!, which democratically governs the Socialist Republic of Skynavia today."
SRS_young_chick:0 "Emilia Stalwart"
SRS_young_chick_desc:0 "Born to a pair of determined socialist revolutionaries from the Heartlands, Emilia Stalwart was only a child when the Skynavia SR was established. Having experienced an education couched in socialist ideology, Emilia nevertheless was not satisfied with her life in Skynavia, instead choosing to go visit the capitalist countries of the south when she graduated.\n\nHaving experienced firsthand the depredations of capitalism, authoritarianism, and monarchism during her travels, she has now returned to her home an ardent internationalist, carrying within her an immutable resolve to change the world for the better."

internationalist_armaments:0 "International Revolutionary Armaments"
SRS_the_general_congress:0 "The General Congress of the Skynavia SR"
SRS_the_general_congress_desc:0 "The General Congress is the governing body of Skynavia, where otherwise normal citizens from electoral constituencies all over the country are nominated by their communities as delegates, and if successfully voted in, serve roughly 4-month terms representing their constituency at the Congress. This system is democratic and open, and ensures that no individual, clique, or political faction is able to dominate Skynavian politics.\n\nThe ever-changing makeup of the Congress, and the lack of political acumen of its delegates, means that Congressional proceedings are oftentimes circuitous, as every motion and proposal is scrutinised and discussed exhaustively. This is viewed as an acceptable price to pay for the democracy and liberty of the Skynavian people."
SRS_northern_star:0 "The Northern Star"

SRS_socialist_clergy_desc:0 "Radicalised griffons, ponies, and other creatures of faith, having adopted the ideals of socialism as a means through which to emancipate their flocks from the injustice and oppression of capitalism and imperialism. Some serve as military chaplains in the Skynavian militias, whilst others evangelise radical anti-capitalist scriptures."

SRS_the_1007_conference_of_the_usrf:0 "The 1007 Conference of the USRF"
SRS_the_1007_conference_of_the_usrf_desc:0 "The world is becoming an increasingly hostile place towards socialism. The forces of reaction, rotten and stagnant as they are, threaten to plunge the continent into warfare and chaos at the behest of the profit-motive. We must discuss the geopolitical situation at hand in order to face the impending challenges of the future."
SRS_debates_1a:0 "Socialism and Progress"
SRS_debates_1a_desc:0 "The Internationalists have argued for a policy of efficient and productive industrialisation. We must seek to strengthen ourselves militarily, socially, and industrially if we are to carry on the revolution and liberate the rest of Griffonia. We must not forget the reason for our exile, and so must fight to return to our homeland as liberators as soon as possible, by all means possible."
SRS_debates_1b:0 "Socialism and the Earth"
SRS_debates_1b_desc:0 "The Communalists have argued for a policy of highly-restrained industrialisation, emphasising a respect for the land and its inhabitants, with strict limits on the environmental pollution and ecological devastation that inevitably follow industrialisation. After all, we live here now and so shall our children, and so we must strive to be better than the polluting capitalists down south."
SRS_debates_1c:0 "Power to the People"
SRS_debates_1c_desc:0 "In the Skynavia SR, where control over local industry is highly decentralised, standards of living vary between the Republic's different constituencies, from the urban heart of New Skynavia, to the anarcho-primitivist communes of the Hail Forest. We must make sure that such basic necessities as water and electricity are available to those communities that want them."
SRS_debates_1d:0 "The Collectivisation of Technology"
SRS_debates_1d_desc:0 "Unlike the decadent bourgeois societies of the Heartlands, Aquileia, or Wingbardy, where the rich enjoy the fruits of technological prowess whilst the poor starve in their hovels nearby, the people of Skynavia shall have equal access to whatever technological advances made by their brethren. Our technological marvels may be few, but they will serve the many, not the few."
SRS_debates_1e:0 "The Liberation of Science"
SRS_debates_1e_desc:0 "The opportunity to work towards the advancement of science should be open to all who desire it. The foundation of a People's University shall make it so that science shall no longer be confined within the realms of the bourgeoisie, the military, and the industrialists, and instead become an aspiration accessible to the inquisitive masses."
SRS_debates_2a:0 "Democracy through Centralism"
SRS_debates_2a_desc:0 "We must institute the tenets of Democratic Centralism within the USRF, where political policy is decided through universal suffrage, and the outcome of the vote is binding on all party members. We must stand in unity against factionalism in order to achieve our revolutionary aspirations."
SRS_debates_2b:0 "Democracy through Confederalism"
SRS_debates_2b_desc:0 "We must move past the myopic statism of authoritarian nationalism, and instead pursue a radical democracy where differing political tendencies can coexist in harmony without conflict. We reject the suppressive orthodoxy of party uniformity, organising along horizontal hierarchies where a direct democracy of the masses can thrive."
SRS_debates_2c:0 "The Charter of The Republic"
SRS_debates_2c_desc:0 "Taking inspiration from the social contracts of the autonomous communes, we shall draft a constitution for our Republic to codify our libertarian and democratic ideals."
SRS_debates_2d:0 "Giving Voice to the Masses"
SRS_debates_2d_desc:0 "The right to take part in direct democracy is already available to the Skynavian citizen, who has access to the weekly assemblies of their local People's Council. The proliferation of radio technology will make it so that everybody anywhere will be able to listen in to and indirectly partake in the meetings of the General Congress taking place in New Skynavia."
SRS_debates_2e:0 "The Democratization of Knowledge"
SRS_debates_2e_desc:0 "We must make sure that the right to a decent and comprehensive education is fulfilled for the people of Skynavia. Schools will be opened where there are none, volunteer teachers will be trained, night courses be made available to the workers, and soon education will be made accessible to all."
SRS_debates_3a:0 "The Revolution of the People"
SRS_debates_3a_desc:0 "Dogmatic party vanguardism begets authoritarianism, where the wishes of the people are subverted to the demands of psuedo-colonial interventions in foreign nations. We must not forget our responsibility to lead the people of Skynavia towards a libertarian socialist future!"
SRS_debates_3b:0 "The Internationalist Vanguard"
SRS_debates_3b_desc:0 "To indulge in societal experimentation at home whilst our brothers and sisters suffer under the capitalist yoke is the highest form of self-indulgent decadence. We have a responsibility to liberate our kin in the name of socialism, and must act accordingly!"
SRS_debates_3c:0 "A Permanent Revolution"
SRS_debates_3c_desc:0 "Both sides of the USRF agree on the need for a so-called 'Permanent Revolution', but what this actually entails is up for debate. It is time for the Front to decide what to make of its namesake."
SRS_debates_3d:0 "The Machinery of Socialism"
SRS_debates_3d_desc:0 "The Internationalists contend that the focus of our industry should be geared towards the provision of armaments for the international socialist revolution, whilst the Communalists insist on first improving the standard of living at home. We shall put this to a vote at the General Congress."
SRS_debates_3e:0 "The Harbingers of Revolution"
SRS_debates_3e_desc:0 "We must remind the world of the incipient socialist revolution! Such a declaration will assert the prosperity of the Skynavia SR and recapitulate our solidarity with our oppressed brethren abroad." 
SRS_war_tree:0 "The War in the North"
SRS_war_tree_desc:0 "Right on our doorstep are the feudalistic Northern Tribes, who have warred against us since the foundation of the Skynavia SR, and incessant petty skirmishes on the border continued to claim the lives of our brave fighters. Something must be done to put an end to this meaningless conflict."
SRS_war_1:0 "Galvanise Our Fighters"
SRS_war_1_desc:0 "We need to rally our friends and family on the home front in order to support our fighters slugging it out with the ponies in the frozen wastes."
SRS_war_2:0 "Galvanise Our Enemies"
SRS_war_2_desc:0 "The ponies we are fighting against are members of an oppressed social group, misled into dying for their feudal overlords. We should send a delegation to try and negotiate an end to the conflict with the Northern Tribes, or failing that, instigate the tribal ponies into rebellion."
SRS_war_3:0 "Ending the Conflict"
SRS_war_3_desc:0 "The feudalistic Northern Tribe is no more. Having freed the tribesponies from their shackles, we must now allow them their freedom to rebuild and remould their society in the socialist image. Of course, we will be there to help them through this difficult transition."
SRS_war_4:0 "From the Ashes of Feudalism..."
SRS_war_4_desc:0 "We have the responsibility to share with our comrades up north all our technological prowess, so they too may benefit, as our brothers and sisters in the revolutionary cause, from the fruits of socialist progress."
SRS_war_5:0 "The Sister Republic Arises!"
SRS_war_5_desc:0 "At the culmination of a great deal of hard work, perseverance, and sacrifice, both on our part and by our pony brethren up north, we have succeeded in developing the territories of the former Northern Tribes through the doctrine of socialism. By democratic vote, the Far Northern Republic shall be established to herald a new era of socialism in the North!"
SRS_military_tree:0 "The Skynavian People's Army"
SRS_military_tree_desc:0 "That the army of Skynavia belongs to the people is indisputable. Already, the most talented commanders of our volunteer militias have developed various tactics suited for the decentralised light-infantry formations of the People's Army for guerilla fighting in arctic weather conditions."
SRS_military_1:0 "Autonomous People's Militias"
SRS_military_1_desc:0 "Further doctrinal and organisational development of the system of autonomous communal militias will best serve the interests of the Skynavian people."
SRS_military_2:0 "Proletarian Revolutionary Guard"
SRS_military_2_desc:0 "How will we be able to export the revolution when we lack the military means to do so? The Proletarian Revolutionary Guard will be formed in order to protect and advance the interests of the International Socialist Revolution, at home and abroad."
SRS_military_3:0 "Armouries of the People"
SRS_military_3_desc:0 "We must cement the control of the people over the means of self-defence, so they will be able to protect their homes against foreign invasion should the occasion arise."
SRS_military_4:0 "Popular Control of the Military"
SRS_military_4_desc:0 "The military must remain subordinate to the will of the people if the ideals of democratic socialism are to be preserved throughout all aspects of the Skynavian SR. A horizontalised command structure will be integral to preserving democracy both within and outside of the military."
SRS_military_5:0 "Centralised Command Structure"
SRS_military_5_desc:0 "Discipline is the glue that holds the military together. The militias of the communes can enjoy their autonomy, but the powers of the military high command must be strengthened if we want to fight and win in the revolutionary struggle to come."
SRS_military_a:0 "The Strong Arm of the Revolution"
SRS_military_a_desc:0 "The advent of armoured tank combat taking place on Equus and Griffonia heralds the beginning of a new age of warfare. The potency of this new aspect of war should not be overlooked, and hence we must pursue development immediately."
SRS_military_b:0 "The Long Arm of the Revolution"
SRS_military_b_desc:0 "Socialism on the High Seas! The socialist revolution shall take to the waves in order to liberate the proletariat of the nations across the ocean in Equus. More importantly, a navy allows us to keep our coastline safe and defend our home from seaborne invasion."
SRS_industry_tree:0 "Consolidate the Means of Production"
SRS_industry_tree_desc:0 "In Skynavia, there are no bosses or capitalists, and the people work for the betterment of society under no coercion or forced labour. The Means of Production are already in the hands of the proletariat, and so we can now focus on a measured and sustainable industrialisation."
SRS_industry_1:0 "Autonomous Cooperatives"
SRS_industry_1_desc:0 "The first thing we should do is to formalise the status of the many autonomous cooperatives found all across Skynavia. While the management structure, scope, and scale of these cooperatives vary greately, they are all united in their egalitarian approach to producing value out of their labour."
SRS_industry_2:0 "Independent Workers' Councils"
SRS_industry_2_desc:0 "The concept of workers' councils may be a holdover from when labour was still controlled by the capitalists, but these councils still serve an invaluable function to Skynavian democracy by allowing for an independent grassroots organisation of the masses."
SRS_industry_3:0 "By the People, For the People"
SRS_industry_3_desc:0 "There is little sense to maintain the concept of private ownership over land, considering the lack of capitalist predation on the livelihoods of the proletariat in Skynavian society. We should encourage and propagate the idea of the public's shared responsibility to maintain and make use of the land in the communities, for the common good."
SRS_industry_4:0 "Feeding the People"
SRS_industry_4_desc:0 "The icy tundras making up most of Skynavia are hardly suited to agriculture. But by working together and applying agrarian socialist concepts to the development of arable land, the spirit of solidarity and perseverance shall soon allow us to achieve a hard-earned autarky."
SRS_industry_5:0 "Educating the People"
SRS_industry_5_desc:0 "By creating a network of communal schools, forming an organisation of travelling specialists, and writing up new school curriculums that allow for greater freedom and personal development, we will soon be able to bring education to the people of Skynavia efficiently and on a large scale."
SRS_industry_a:0 "Arming the People"
SRS_industry_a_desc:0 "Attention should be paid to the construction of communal armouries and gunsmiths, so each community, collective, and commune within Skynavia will each be capable of protecting their homes themselves."
SRS_industry_b:0 "Nurturing the People"
SRS_industry_b_desc:0 "The development gap between the urbanised areas of New Skynavia and the independent communes filling up the rest of Skynavia must be addressed. Groups of volunteers from the city, bringing with them their expertise, as well as all sorts of machinery and raw material, shall pursue intensive development within the communes dotting the banks of the Skynavia river delta."
SRS_diplomacy_tree:0 "Socialism In Our Time"
SRS_diplomacy_tree_desc:0 "It is essential for all the socialist nations of the world to be united in our shared fight for the international revolution and the liberation of our oppressed comrades abroad. By sending delegates to socialist nations abroad, we will take the first step in creating the bonds of brotherhood between the free nations of the world."
SRS_diplomacy_1:0 "Our Brothers in Arms"
SRS_diplomacy_1_desc:0 "The benevolence of the monarchist rule in Vedina does not hide the fact that it is still an instrument of class oppression that has created and actively maintains an unjust status quo. We must decide now on how to intervene in Vedina to liberate its proletariat from the shackles of feudalism and monarchism."
SRS_diplomacy_2:0 "Our Comrades in Need"
SRS_diplomacy_2_desc:0 "Decades ago, we had split with the Republicans in Cloudsbury over their refusal to share power with the people they profess to be liberating. Their centralisation of power within an exclusive cadre of the military cost them the support of the people, contributing to the failure of the First Griffonian Revolution. We must reclaim the revolutionary ideal for the proletariat!"
SRS_diplomacy_3:0 "Internationalist Brigades"
SRS_diplomacy_3_desc:0 "Both sides of the Congress have agreed on a policy where foreign fighters for the revolutionary socialist cause are to be welcomed to the Skynavia SR as fellow comrades and brothers in arms. These volunteers will fight in our Internationalist Brigades. The first of these Brigades to be created will be the Lions of Skynavia, formed by the hardened veterans of many a socialist insurrection abroad."
SRS_diplomacy_4:0 "Friendship of Species"
SRS_diplomacy_4_desc:0 "Taking the concept of the Internationalist Brigades to the next level, we will now start recruiting revolutionaries of different races from Equus and Griffonia, allowing them to fight in specialist units that make the best out of the physiological advantages of their respective races."
SRS_diplomacy_5:0 "Welcome the Exiles"
SRS_diplomacy_5_desc:0 "Three prominent revolutionaries - Emma Goldgriff, Mikhail Beakunin, and Pierre Proudpone - once departed from the Skynavia SR a long time ago, citing the lack of action to liberate the oppressed of our neighbouring countries. Now that we have accomplished what seemed impossible a few decades ago, we can invite our exiled comrades back home."
SRS_peace_and_plenty:0 "§HThe Land of Peace And Plenty§!"
SRS_peace_and_plenty_desc:0 "With the culmination of our democratically-driven industrialisation, the Skynavia SR is slowly and surely transitioning into a socialist utopia. The internationalists and communalists may have their differences, but in the end we have learnt to work together in the spirit of true socialist solidarity and brotherhood. In Skynavia, we are all brothers and sisters in our great socialist family."
SRS_purge_1:0 "§RSocialism has Failed us§!"
SRS_purge_1_desc:0 "The failure of the socialist leadership to guide our nation through the hardships of war has left the population thoroughly disillusioned with the Republic's founding dream of a socialist utopia. This gives us breathing space to consolidate our power. However, the much of the nation's youth have only known a life under socialism, and our power grab may soon backfire if we fail to pacify the people..."
SRS_purge_2a:0 "Learning to live as Individuals"
SRS_purge_2a_desc:0 "For too long the spirit of the Skynavian individual has been suppressed by the stifling collectivism of socialist ideology. The people of our nation need to be retaught how to live as individuals, freed from the rigid conformism of such false concepts as "solidarity" and "mutual aid"."
SRS_purge_2b:0 "Work Camps"
SRS_purge_2b_desc:0 "For the most vocal of the dissidents against our regime, as well as those irrevocably tainted by their association with the socialist ruling apparatus - activists, Congressional delegates, teachers, philosophers, and community leaders - there is no option but to resign their fates to the work camps, where they may perhaps see the error of their ways through the virtues of hard labour."
SRS_purge_2c:0 "Labour Units"
SRS_purge_2c_desc:0 "To supplant the failed socialist system of workers' cooperatives and collectives, a system will be implement where individuals are grouped, according to their physical ability, geographical proximity, and other factors, into Labour Units where the social functions of work, sustenance, and community all take place within the Unit."
SRS_purge_3a:0 "Army Decimations"
SRS_purge_3a_desc:0 "The infusion of political ideology into military doctine enforced by the socialist regime has led to the stagnation of our armed forces. To break free from the spinelessness of the old military, we will unfortunately have to rid ourselves of the officers and theorists, as well as those rank-and-file, clinging onto the old ways. A tenth of all personnel will be liquidated."
SRS_purge_3b:0 "Decentralised Fear"
SRS_purge_3b_desc:0 "To further hammer in the finality of our split from socialism into the public consciousness, we will initiate an extensive program of undercover policing and surveilance. Furthermore, various incentives will be introduced for those who inform on their neighours and acquaintances for socialist behaviour. The populace shall redeem themselves from the socialist scourge forthwith."
SRS_purge_4a:0 "Martial Law in Perpetuality"
SRS_purge_4a_desc:0 "The linchpin of our plan to consolidate power is the indefinite extension of the current state of martial law. The most ideologically-pure sections of the armed forces shall be given extensive judicial and governmental authority over civil society, which will hopefully keep the degenerates, thought-traitors, and subversives within our nation in line."
SRS_purge_4b:0 "Overhaul the Education System"
SRS_purge_4b_desc:0 "Education is the tool through which we nurture the next generation of Skynavians. A complete overhaul of our nation's curriculum to excise all socialist influences is imperative to the survival of the regime. Emphasis will be placed on the infusion of values such as order, discipline, and obedience to the state in our students."
SRS_purge_4c:0 "Destroy Subversive Literature"
SRS_purge_4c_desc:0 "The tools through which socialism has infected the minds of the populace is through the media. Censorship will be applied to radio and newspaper, but our attention will mainly be focused on the destruction of subversive and degenerate literature. We shall start by emptying out all the libraries of Skynavia and purging all reading material and associated media compromised by socialist thought."
SRS_commune_1:0 "Picking up the Pieces"
SRS_commune_1_desc:0 "The dream of a socialist utopia in Skynavia was shattered with the persecution and decimation its chief progenitor, the United Socialist Revolutionary Front, by the military junta. But although they once stood idly by as the socialism that nurtured them was trodden into the dirt, the people of Skynavia rallied and reclaimed their home from the forces of reaction. Now, we rebuild what we have lost."
SRS_commune_2a:0 "Dissolving the Army"
SRS_commune_2a_desc:0 "It was the so-called People's Army that aided and abetted Sickleclaw's power grab. They have betrayed the Skynavian people and the international Socialist cause. Traitors that they are, the Army shall be disbanded, the battalions dissolved and their weapons and equipment redistributed, with the Skynavian communes all responsible for their own self-defence. Militarism's taint shall exist no more."
SRS_commune_2b:0 "Exiling the Commanders"
SRS_commune_2b_desc:0 "The Army may have been the main tool of Sickleclaw's oppression, but the fact remains that it was under the leadership of their commanders that they were turned to serve the forces of reaction. The moral culpability for the Army's wrongdoing thus lies with their commanders as well. They shall be exiled for their treacherous crimes, never again allowed to set foot on Skynavian soil."
SRS_commune_2c:0 "Swords into Ploughshares"
SRS_commune_2c_desc:0 "Life under martial law and military oppression has left Skynavia with a bitter distaste towards all militarism. It is inherently undemocratic and unjust for any creature to have control over the life and death of their neighbour through force of arms. Therefore we will seek to demilitarise Skynavia, so that we may live in peace."
SRS_commune_3a:0 "To Each Their Own"
SRS_commune_3a_desc:0 "Who are we, and what right do we have, as the General Congress, to tell the people of Skynavia what do do, which goods to manufacture, who they should die for? Decrees from the Congress are no longer binding to the autonomous communes of Skynavia, who are free to pursue their own policies. The democracy of the people shall be secure!"
SRS_commune_3b:0 "Laws Unto Themselves"
SRS_commune_3b_desc:0 "No longer can we consciously expropriate the hard-earned fruits of the labour of our people, not even in the name of collectivism. Our workers shall have a greatly expanded say in the use of the goods they produce. Of course, basic necessities shall remain free and available to all who desire them, and this is understood by everyone."
SRS_the_final_focus:0 "Finally, Peace"
SRS_the_final_focus_desc:0 "The traumas of military rule has left Skynavian society scarred and battered, but we have emerged from that dark period stronger and more united than ever. Having had our rights taken from us, we now know to cherish our freedoms and liberties more than ever, and shall protect them so that all may thrive under a new and freer age of Skynavian libertarian socialism."

socrep_grif.1.t:0 "The 1007 Conference of the USRF"
socrep_grif.1.d:0 "From all across the Socialist Republic of Skynavia, both urban centers and rural communities, if such terms can even be used for the frozen north, they gathered. Socialists, anarchists, communists and representatives of several other, more radical or unique leftist ideologies assembled in New Skynavia.\n\nA great task awaited these revolutionaries. The world continued to plunge deeper into the cold and cruel claws of monarchism, nationalism and of course, capitalism by the day. And thus, as the world kept becoming more and more hateful towards both them and their ideology, more drastic decisions than ever had to be taken and more drastic actions performed. \n\nHowever, there were difficulties agreeing on just what needs to be done. This was nothing new as the two political factions of the Skynavian General Congress: the Communalists and the Internationalists, while eager to participate in transforming the country into a truly free and prosperous land, have had countless disagreements over how exactly such a process should be performed. That’s not even mentioning the dozens of rushed policies which resulted in dissatisfaction of the populace and previous supporters switching sides, something which led to loss of seats in the General Congress and thus the loss of the ability to implement most decisions. While the system of various checks and balances should either side from becoming completely dominant over the other, many members of both coalitions are, or at least used to be, afraid of implementing large reforms due to the potential loss of support across the populace.\n\nThough it seems that with the current Conference reaching it’s end, there has been a shift in the mentalities of both the Communalists and Internationalists. With the situation being as drastic as it is, both groups seemed to be agreeing that while their ideas might be opposed, if the republic wishes to survive these turbulent times, accommodation is the only option."

socrep_grif.3.t:0 "Socialism and the Air we Breathe"
socrep_grif.4.t:0 "Democracy, Unity, Progress"
socrep_grif.4.d:0 "While the claims of the anarchists within the Communalist coalition that increased centralism, even if democratic, could very easily lead to entire groups lacking representation and the potential slow transformation of the system into a dictatorial one, were fears that many within the General Congress held themselves, it was still decided that while a direct democracy based on horizontal hierarchies is a goal that should be striven towards, the current era requires as much unity between the various political groups within the country as possible. This would be extremely difficult to accomplish with a system where even the concept of a “political party” is a foreign one. Furthermore while observing other revolutionary movements and states one can clearly see that sometimes a vertical hierarchy, even if partially contradictory to the idea of true equality between all creatures, is a necessity in order to create circumstances which would lead to an utopia in the future. Thus the ideas of Democratic Centralism will be implemented in the Socialist Republic of Skynavia.\n\nHowever, like many times before, various citizens and communities believe that our policies which are meant to give them a truly stable future, are nothing more than an attempt to gain power, and thus they have chosen to change the faction which they support."
socrep_grif.4.a:0 "Progress and unity are necessities if we wish to survive."
socrep_grif.5.t:0 "A Democracy of the Masses"
socrep_grif.5.d:0 "While the arguments of the few more statist leaning representatives about the potential factionalism and the weakening of the republic in the event of an even more radical variation of democracy is implemented have been quite convincing and will definitely lead to some communities joining the Internationalist side the moment the new system shows any flaws, the General Congress has decided that such risk is truly worthy as long as each and every citizen of our republic can truly represent their own interests and ideas on the political stage. Thus the system of direct democracy based on horizontal hierarchies which has already been used by some communes and collectives will be adapted and encouraged on a grander scale all across the Socialist Republic of Skynavia.\n\nOf course, like always there are many citizens who, while previously more inclined to support the Communalist coalition, are dissatisfied with the implementation of this new system and thus have decided to support the Internationalist faction instead."

socrep_grif.6.t:0 "Socialism Belongs to All"
socrep_grif.6.d:0 "Despite the vehement opposition from the more radical communalists and anarchists, the General Congress has decided that if we wish to achieve the true socialist goal of world revolution, some compromises need to be made. Our citizens already posses freedoms which millions of workers and serfs enslaved by the bourgeoisie and tyrants to the south do not. Thus, with our position of power, it is our duty to bring liberty and freedom to those who are suffering from oppression across Griffonia and the world, even if we have to employ some measures which our opposition claims are authoritarian or statist. After all, if we wish to create an army strong enough for these wars of liberation and effectively work together with any other socialist states we will need a more centralized government, an internationalist vanguard around which a liberation of all workers can be organized.\n\nHowever, it seems that our decision to begin preparing for the upcoming world revolution has led to some communities which previously supported us loosing their faith in our goals as their freedoms, which they seem to have greatly appreciated, were limited by our decision to increase the size of our army and give more power to a central authority."
socrep_grif.6.a:0 "Another step towards worker's liberation!"
socrep_grif.7.t:0 "Socialism Belongs to The People"
socrep_grif.7.d:0 "Despite the vehement opposition from the more radical internationalists and vanguardists, the General Congress has decided that in order to create a truly free and prosperous society, an even more anti-statist stance needs to be taken. While our citizens already posses far more social and political freedoms than the oppressed workers and serfs of the tyrannies to the south, that is true, just being better than the worst is not a motivation to stop in our march towards a Libertarian Socialist Utopia. This is why the internationalists, while clearly motivated by the noble wish to liberate the millions of subjugated griffons who slave away, are clearly misguided. After all, how can we bring true liberty to the workers of the world if we ourselves don’t truly follow our ideals?\n\nThus with this new stance taken, our republic will be even further decentralized, with the various communes and collectives receiving far more power in solving various local problems and enacting regional policies. Furthermore this will allow these local organizations to increase the size of the regional militias which will allow both these collectives and our republic to organize a better defense against any possible enemies.\n\nHowever, it seems that several of the communities which had previously supported our goal of a Libertarian Socialist Utopia, have been persuaded by the internationalist arguments and have embraced their goal of a world revolution."

Demanding an end to Sickleclaw's dictatorial rule, the crowd was allowed to proceed unchallenged by sympathetic military units who had had enough of the authoritarian military regime.

The ensuring close-quarters combat, fought with paving stones and placards against rifles and a machine-gun emplacement, ended with the defeat of this last-ditch defence of the military regime.\n\nThe corpse of Sickleclaw, who had shot himself in his office, was retrieved and strung up on a lamppost, and the rest of his staff were imprisoned by the victorous revolutionaries, whilst army units elsewhere in the country were disarmed when the news of the successful revolt reached the rest of Skynavia.\n\nAs a successor to the defunct Socialist Republic of Skynavia, the Commune of Skynavia has arisen with the promise of a new era of libertarian and democratic Socialist governance."

socrep_grif.52.d:0 "After months of purges, repressions and propaganda, Skynavia is slowly settling down. The Congress is a distant memory, the communes have been broken up by the military, and bit by bit, every last vestige of Socialism is being destroyed, one way or another. Civilian authority is all but disbanded, except for where it serves as a convenient accessory to the military, and Sickleclaw now serves as Dictator of the Republic.\n\nOrder has finally been imposed on the nation through the only way that truly works, brute force, and it is kept in place through strict policing and unforgiving punishments. Despite this, however, there is neither time nor reason to relax. Socialism is an insidious thing and it can grow where you least expect it. Therefore, martial law will be extended indefinitely, until such a time that Sickleclaw deems it no longer necessary.\n\nAll is quiet in Skynavia. The military patrols pass unharassed through the capital city's neighbourhoods, even those which had once been hotbeds of radical socialist movements. The assembly halls are all boarded up; some have been repurposed as impromptu prisons by the military. The anarcho-primitivist communes deep within the Hail Forest have been rooted out and eradicated, their members scattered to the winds.\n\nBut the people of Skynavia remember. They remember life as it had been under the Socialist Republic. And they remember the lofty ideals of the International Socialist Revolution.\n\nIt might take years, or even decades, of struggle. But deep within the hearts of every creature in Skynavia, from the lowliest political dissident rotting in a prison cell, to Asper Sickleclaw himself, is the knowledge that the military regime will not last - someday, freedom and democracy shall return to the icy lands of Skynavia."

socrep_grif.53.d:0 "General Malcolm Granger sat quietly in his seat, keeping his attention onto the papers of him as he listened to the droning voice of the lecturer in front of them all. They had been here for three hours already, and it likely would continue for some more. He had not made any fuss about it, however, and he wasn’t going to - he was much too fond of his neck to do that.\n\nMaybe once his word would have counted for something, but now he was a pawn of Sickleclaw, like everyone else in this nation. Did he resent his superior for it? Not really, if he had faith in nothing else, he had faith in Asper. The griffon had led them this far and would lead them further, it was just so... tedious!\n\nHe remembered the march north, the struggle to get Skynavia secured and and the battles against the Northern Tribes. There had been a purpose to work for, hopes and dreams to fufill. He had been part of a greater cause and built something new. And yet it was all gone now, swept away and declared a huge mistake. Was that his life, then? A mistake until now? Would Sickleclaw be the one to offer the people of Skynavia a new path?"

socrep_grif.54.d:0 "The city street was silent, bar for the few souls walking along it, hurrying to their destinations and not stopping to talk with anyone or delaying anywhere. It was too dangerous to do so nowadays. Who knew who’d be watching? A pony wandering the streets looked up to the side when something flashed by in the corner of her eye and saw a curtain pull back quickly in one of the windows. Unnerved, she hurried up to get home, not wanting to remain outside and longer than needed.\n\nScenes like these were everywhere nowadays, ever since the new laws on reporting dissident activity, people had realized that anyone could be an informant. Only after a few months, almost every creature in Skynavia knew someone who had been snatched up by the secret police, and in too many cases, these people were never seen again. Was the pony a dissident trying to avoid detection? Was the griffin behind the curtain an informant? Nobody knew for sure, and bit by bit, people realized just how vulnerable they were. A wrong word there, a sour glance there, and suddenly a paranoid neighbor, colleague or even, gods forbid, a family member, might report you."

socrep_grif.55.d:0 "All across Skynavia, libraries, schools, communal bookshelves, and book warehouses were beset upon by gangs of soldiers, who methodologically carted out wheelbarrows full of books, preparing them for transport to New Skynavia. Libraries in particular were singled out for the most brutal treatment; after their catalogues had been looted, they were torched and burnt to the ground. In the frontier commune of Old Dragon, an elderly librarian, after putting up an armed resistance with an old revolver against the soldiers defiling the library, was bayoneted and left to perish in the flames.\n\nThe confiscated books reached New Skynavia by train, ferry, balloon, and muscle transport. There, they were piled in a great heap at the centre of the city square in a pile reaching ten metres high. In the presence of a large part of the city's populace, the books were doused in gasoline, before being set aflame.\n\nThose in the crowd who were angered or otherwise upset by this act of cultural, literary, and political censorship were obliged to keep their subversive thoughts to themselves, because of the armed guards and machine-gun emplacements watching over the crowd.\n\nThe great bonfire continued to burn well into the evening, the great licks of smoke and flame rising from the burning books combining with the last rays of sunlight that painted the evening sky a fiery amber."

socrep_grif.56.d:0 "Starflank was incredibly confused by the new school curriculum. Gone were the craftwork classes where the students could create all sorts of wooden sculptures at their leisure. Gone were the in-class discussions about current affairs and socialist politics. And gone were the amiable volunteer teachers, who the students had come to love as friends and confidants.\n\nIn fact, the only thing that seemed to remain unchanged were the military drills, which included instructions on how to handle a rifle, shooting practice, and basic foraging and scouting skills. But now their instructors were unsmiling and grim faced soldiers, who barked harshly at the students, and engaged in harsh disciplinary measures at the slightest of provocations.\n\nStarflank missed the old days, where she was able to think of going to school with anticipation and joy. But she knew better to voice such a sentiment out loud, as doing so would probably get her caned, if not worse."

socrep_grif.57.d:0 "The drumbeat echoed over the field as the battalion stood in formation, silent down to the last griffin, as from behind their commander was dragged out in front of them, gagged, with claws and wings bound and a bag over his head. He was dragged up and tied to a wooden post that stood waiting for him. None in the unit moved a single muscle as the old griffin was tied to the post, struggling and emitting muffled protests as his arms were bound behind the post and the MPs stepped back. A dozen more MPs, all armed with rifles, stepped up in front of the post, readying their guns and aiming. The drumbeat continued steadily, inexorably, until it suddenly accelerated, rising to a rapid staccato that suddenly ended. When it did, twelve rifles rang out and the commander's body shook before falling limp. Thoroughout the formation, several soldiers struggled to retain their composure, some clenching their claws or gritting their beaks.\n\n\"There can be no dissent within the Republic's ranks!\" An MP officer that had stepped up in front of the griffins yelled\"All those who threaten its stability will be dealt with thusly! Return to your quarters!\" The battalion left in silence, leaving its dead commander behind as the MPs watched them silently. The officer, meanwhile, leaned in to the griffin beside him.\n\n"Third row, fifth column. Twelfth row, fourth column. Note down potential dissidents.""

socrep_grif.58.d:0 "There came a point in one’s life where the tragic reached the point of absurdity. As Malcolm Granger gathered up his things and stuffed it into his bag, he reflected on this fact. He had already been uneasy with Sickleclaw’s regime, but he had believed in the griffin over the revolution, and now the revolution had won out in the long run. Tossing it over his shoulder, he walked out to the door where two militiamen waited for him. Without a word, they escorted him through the streets towards the docks and as he walked, he could see faces, familiar faces, that looked towards him with suspicion and even hatred. He didn’t really blame them.\n\nWhen on the ship, he got below deck and sat down, staring listlessly out of the window as the ship started to slowly depart from what for so many years had been his home now. Beyond the duffle bag by his side, he had nothing to his name. He could not go back home to Griffenheim, he was still a socialist traitor. He was not welcome in Skynavia, he was a traitor to them too. The world was not kind to those who chose wrong he thought quietly, watching New Skynavia vanish in the mists behind the ship."

The faith of the Skynavian people in the international socialist revolutionary cause has been irrevocably shaken, both by the ravages of warfare with foreign powers, and the self-mutilatory oppression by themselves of their own brethren.\n\nOn this day, communities all over the newly-freed Skynavia observed a five-minute moment of silence, for all the Skynavian victims of warfare, as well as to those murdered, tortured, or disappeared by the brief but brutal rule of the military regime. In the weeks following the deposing of Sickleclaw, the prisons were opened and their prisoners released, funeral processions were held for the dead, assembly halls reopened and community meetings resumed, and the fragile democracy of the former Skynavian SR, once broken nearly beyond repair, but now salvaged and loving tended to, restored, with the reinstatement of a reformed General Congress.\n\nThe road to reconciliation will be long and hard. Already, the oppressive institutions of state power are being dismantled, but only time shall heal the deep wounds wrought onto Skynavian society, not only by the military commanders who had betrayed the Socialist dream by seizing power, but also by the Skynavian people as a whole, who had stood by and abetted such despotism.\n\nWe should have known better."
