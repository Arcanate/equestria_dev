#Focus:
CRY_NLR_night_shroud:0 "The Night's Shroud"
CRY_NLR_night_shroud_desc:0 "Far from Canterlot, far from Manehattan, the Empress has sent us to assert control over the subjugated Crystal Empire. The Mi Amore family will bend the knee, and the crystal ponies will know that their true ruler is Nightmare Moon. Should they prove themselves to be loyal and cooperative, we just might treat them kindly in return." 
CRY_NLR_royal_family:0 "Fate Of The Royal Family"
CRY_NLR_royal_family_desc:0 "The Crystal Princess and her consort are the Empire's unifying factor. They must see reason and cooperate with our new rule, or the disused dungeons will be having its first occupants in a thousand years. Nightmare Moon has made this our first priority."
CRY_NLR_rare_privilege:0 "A Rare Priviledge"
CRY_NLR_rare_privilege_desc:0 "After much deliberation, the Empress has sent one of her close confidants to rule in her steed over the Crystal Empire. To everypony's surprise, she has sent Rarity, one of the elements of harmony. This has not gone without complaints from the thestral garrison, but the Empress has assured us that Rarity is loyal and obedient."
CRY_NLR_reward_supporters:0 "Nightfall"
CRY_NLR_reward_supporters_desc:0 "Nightmare Moon has been impressed with our quick and capable takeover of the Crystal Empire. She has chosen one of her most devoted followers, Misty Night, to guide the Crystal Empire through the night and establish a haven for thestrals. All praise Her resplendent Majesty!"
CRY_NLR_convince_royalty:0 "Convince Cadance And Shining"
CRY_NLR_convince_royalty_desc:0 "In the times before the upheaval, Rarity was on familiar terms with the previous rulers of the Crystal Empire. Despite the changed situation, she believes she can convince them to assist in keeping the ponies content with the new regime. It only takes a generous offer, of course."
CRY_NLR_crystal_bat_caves:0 "Encourage Thestral Settlement"
CRY_NLR_crystal_bat_caves_desc:0 "Batpony population is almost nonexistant in the Crystal Empire. No records exist of their presence before the disappearance, and since the Empire's return, very few have decided to make their home this far north. The Empress and [CRY.GetLeader] find this unacceptable, and are coordinating together to create an immigration campaign aimed at thestrals."
CRY_NLR_solarist_reprisals:0 "Solarist Reprisals"
CRY_NLR_solarist_reprisals_desc:0 "There are many who still cling to their outdated values and rolemodels. We must remind the ponies that the new order is here to stay, and dissidents will not be tolerated. So it has been decreed."
CRY_NLR_maintain_principles:0 "Maintain Harmonic Principles"
CRY_NLR_maintain_principles_desc:0 "Rarity is aware that the Empress... takes a more heavy-hoofed approach to rulership, but this doesn't mean we have to abandon the values ponies held true since the unification of the Three Tribes. The populace will be assured of our good intentions."
CRY_NLR_night_guard_veterans:0 "Night Guard Veterans"
CRY_NLR_night_guard_veterans_desc:0 "After a request from our cautious ruler, the Empress has acquiesced and allowed the transfer. Within the month, some of the most battle hardened and valourous batpony soldiers will make their home here in the Crystal Empire, which will ensure that any neighsayers think twice before acting in dissent."
CRY_NLR_lunar_admin:0 "Direct Rule From Crystal City"
CRY_NLR_lunar_admin_desc:0 "[CRY.GetLeader] has made it very clear that this administration's focus is on the Crystal City. Our objective is to divert as much of the nation's resources as possible down south, whether it is in produced goods or ores from the crystal mines. The Empress will have her quotas fulfilled."
CRY_NLR_keep_old_generals:0 "Welcome Back Former Generals"
CRY_NLR_keep_old_generals_desc:0 "The decision has produced much contention, but Rarity has decided, against the wishes of her advisors, to reinstate force commanders who were removed due to their suspected treachery. We will remain vigilant over their actions, but as long as they serve the Empire and Nightmare Moon without complaint, their freedom will be guaranteed."
CRY_NLR_were_all_friends:0 "We Are All Friends Here"
CRY_NLR_were_all_friends_desc:0 "Thestral or not, superiour or subordinate, it matters little - the spirit of harmony shall prevail in the Crystal Empire. When the times are the hardest, we must not turn on each other - we must remember what makes the pony way of life compared to others."
CRY_NLR_deal_with_sombra_supporters:0 "Deal With Sombra's Supporters"
CRY_NLR_deal_with_sombra_supporters_desc:0 "The recent instability has emboldened certain individuals, ponies who would throw everything away in service to a tyrannical overlord. The night's cover will not hide these insane cultists, we shall root them out and prevent any notion of Sombra's return."
CRY_NLR_resources_for_empress:0 "Resources For The Empress"
CRY_NLR_resources_for_empress_desc:0 "The inhospitable Crystal Mountains are a danger for even the most seasoned mountain climber, not to mention the constant blizzards, worn down paths and ancient evils lurking, but our prospectors have found rich veins of resources that are quite rare in Equestria proper. The Empress has decreed that that the material deficit must be solved, and the riches of the Crystal Mountains shall belong to Her."
CRY_NLR_mandatory_conscript:0 "Mandatory Conscription"
CRY_NLR_mandatory_conscript_desc:0 "The recent strife has thoroughly removed the idea of a peaceful way of life that was the norm in the previous millenia. Now with potential enemies on all sides, we require an ever greater amount of ponies to serve in the Crystal Army. So shall it be, by the word of the Empress."
CRY_NLR_thestral_pony_reg:0 "Mixed Thestral-Pony Regiments"
CRY_NLR_thestral_pony_reg_desc:0 "What better way to instill trust between ponies and thestrals but to have them bleed and die together? The camaraderie of military life will show them that despite their outward differences, they all share the same goal. It also never hurts to have more soldiers at the ready."
CRY_NLR_fug_bat_day:0 "Crystal Fashion Festival"
CRY_NLR_fug_bat_day_desc:0 "The doom and glooms that fills recent days is a detriment on the population overall. Rarity has a splendid idea how to lift their spirits and promote her newest clothing line."
CRY_NLR_increased_guard_presence:0 "Increased Night Guard Presence"
CRY_NLR_increased_guard_presence_desc:0 "The region may be pacified, but we need more capable ponies to lead our growing armies. The local ones are either inexperienced, or cannot be trusted. We shall call forth the motherland and ask for a simple request."
CRY_NLR_austerity_program:0 "Austerity Programs"
CRY_NLR_austerity_program_desc:0 "The ponies must be taught the value of sacrifice - every resource that can be spared for the war effort will contribute to the final victory. [CRY.GetLeader] is setting an example herself by giving up on unneeded luxuries, and she expects the ponies to follow as well."
CRY_NLR_weapons_for_cause:0 "Weapons For The Cause"
CRY_NLR_weapons_for_cause_desc:0 "The spirit of ponies wins the wars, but to do so, they require contemporary weapons and protection. A state subsidised company will be formed to produce exclusively magically infused rifles, which is expected to soon supplant the basic weaponry ponies have used thus far. Concerns have been raised about the reliability of such firearms, but the designers have assured us that testing will eliminate any faults."
CRY_NLR_inevitable_conflict:0 "The Looming Conflict"
CRY_NLR_inevitable_conflict_desc:0 "Nopony relishes the fact that war is inevitable. From within or without, at some point we will have to send ponies to fight. We must be prepared for such an event, and do everything we can to minimise the impact on the civilians. But all must be aware of the one crucial fact: we fight and die for the Empress."
CRY_NLR_equal_representation:0 "Expand Bureaucratic Ranks"
CRY_NLR_equal_representation_desc:0 "The nocturnal nature of the batponies means we can continue working around the clock. Productivity will greatly soar once we implement these reforms and allow thestrals to work for the goverment without restrictions."
CRY_NLR_finish_industrialisation:0 "Finish Industrialising Crystal City"
CRY_NLR_finish_industrialisation_desc:0 "Since its return from the frozen wastes, the Crystal Empire has stagnated behind Equestria in terms of industry, population and technology. Although many of these issues have been resolved by the time of our glorious rule, there still remains a sizable gap we could remove. The Empress demands results and we must not fail Her."
CRY_NLR_prepare_for_inevitable:0 "Prepare For The Inevitable"
CRY_NLR_prepare_for_inevitable_desc:0 "With potential enemies on all sides, the Moon Crystal Governorate needs to stand tall and strong should war break out. It is a shame that the crystal ponies have to be conscripted and levied en masse, but we must show the Empress that we can and will defend ourself should the need arise. Rarity has prepared an extensive plan for implementing reforms to conscription and production."
CRY_NLR_lunar_benevolence:0 "Lunar Benevolence"
CRY_NLR_lunar_benevolence_desc:0 "The Moon is not a harsh mistress. On the contrary, the ponies need to be shown the glory, beauty and splendour of the night, and that their former sun loving, cake stealing princess was only coddling them, preventing them from achieving their fullest. Yes, the ponies will know and appreciate Nightmare Moon's love."
CRY_NLR_loyalty_to_the_moon:0 "Loyalty To The Moon, Our Saviour"
CRY_NLR_loyalty_to_the_moon_desc:0 ""She has given us freedom, She has freed us from servitude and oppression, She is our unquestioned leader and saviour. All praises be to Nightmare Moon, the true ruler of Equestria and beyond!""
CRY_NLR_invite_advisors:0 "Invite Imperial Advisors"
CRY_NLR_invite_advisors_desc:0 "What this country needs is capable ponies - we have a decent number, but not enough! We shall send an invitation to the Equestria's best and brightest, asking them to lend their services to the Crystal Empire. Anypony who makes the journey to the cold north will be generously compensated."
CRY_NLR_crystal_night_fair:0 "Crystal Night Fair"
CRY_NLR_crystal_night_fair_desc:0 "Rulers and times changes, but the traditions of this fair land shall never be smirched. The Crystal Fair shall be held again, perhaps with a fresh coat of paint, to remind the crystal ponies of their heritage and history. It is also a perfect occasion to showcase how good we are to the populace. Truly, it will be a good time for all."
CRY_NLR_empress_visit:0 "The Empress' Visit"
CRY_NLR_empress_visit_desc:0 "Her Imperial Majesty is expected to make a visit in the following weeks, and her priorities are to see the progress our rule has made and to have a personal discussion with her dear friend, Rarity. Let us ensure that the crystal ponies give the Empress the royal welcome She deserves!"
CRY_NLR_research_cooperation:0 "Research Opportunities"
CRY_NLR_research_cooperation_desc:0 "This land may have been shrouded in the dark mists for centuries, but its vaults and libraries contain innumerable fonts of knowledge that are still applicable in the science of today. Putting our brightest minds together would benefit us all greatly, and propel Equestria to a shining beyond."
CRY_NLR_crystal_manehattan_railroad:0 "Crystal City - Manehattan Railroad"
CRY_NLR_crystal_manehattan_railroad_desc:0 "Few roads lead this far north, and even fewer are the rail lines that connect Equestria and the Crystal Empire. In coordination with our colleagues in Equestria, we shall constuct a connection between Crystal City and Manehattan, enabling large scale trade and population movement. We shall all benefit greatly from this endeavour."
CRY_NLR_nights_embrace:0 "The Night's Embrace"
CRY_NLR_nights_embrace_desc:0 "This land has proven itself to be an exemplary tributary of the Empress. The ponies are obedient and devoted, our forces are hardy and numerous, and our industry is strong. [CRY.GetLeader] will commune with the Empress and decide in unison the future of this nation."

CRYSTAL_BAT:0 ""
FINSKABAT:0 "Snow Puff is part of a thestral tribe that migrated far north many generations ago, and has thus adapted to cold more than their ancestors in the south. Snow Puff herself was the one who convinced her tribe to support Luna as she advocated for reforms, and participated in combat on the Empire's northern frontier. She had a habit of getting extremely drunk before battle, then recklessly charging at the enemy while screeching obscene words. For her brave and loyal service, she was rewarded a position in the Night Guard and quickly rose through the ranks. Now, she has been assigned to the frigid Crystal Empire, and she feels like being home."
KHALMYKBAT:0 "Born in Ravenskoye, Severyana region, during the time when the province still paid respects to the Equestrian Crown, Wild Strikes has personally experienced the first Marksist Revolution. However, he was too young to participate, regardless of his disinterest, and the region's thestral population were too jaded to believe in the communist ideals. The distrustful relations between the Severyana Republic and Equestria meant the batponies could not easily leave the country.\n\nThe return of Luna invoked a sense of allegiance in Wild Strikes towards the one pony who showed compassion to the shunned thestrals, and he made his way to Canterlot, after a long and grueling journey. He was among the first to join the reformed Night Guard, although at that time it was merely a ceremonial guard with little influence. Over the years, this slowly changed.\n\nRecently, Wild Strikes experienced haunting dreams in which batponies were prosecuted and chased out of Equestria. All alongside an eerie voice which implored him to take the right side when the natural order fell into pieces. During the civil war, his loyalties were already predetermined, and he has shown himself to be a capable leader of ponies. The Empress Herself has personally noted his talents, and granted Wild Strikes a promotion and a free choice in his next assignment."
