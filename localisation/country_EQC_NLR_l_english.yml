 ### FOCUS ###
 EQC_NLR_reorganise_the_government:0 "Reorganise the Government"
 EQC_NLR_reorganise_the_government_desc:0 "Jet Set has proven himself enough to warrant a second chance at power under her Majesty. His peers, meanwhile, have not and must be replaced by far more credible citizens of the new Lunar Empire. Many of those are likely to be fellow thestrals who have long since been cheated out of any position of power previously under Celestia's rule."
 EQC_NLR_welcome_refugees:0 "Welcome Civil War Refugees"
 EQC_NLR_welcome_refugees_desc:0 "During the civil war, numerous ponies were displaced from their homes, scarred and driven on the run due to the destruction that the war brought to all corners of Equestria. But there was one bastion of ponykind that barely saw any fighting. New Mareland. Shielded by the oceans, it stands unblemished and untouched. In the interest of friendship, let us open our doors for them."
 EQC_NLR_fleeing_capital:0 "Poach the Fleeing Capital"
 EQC_NLR_fleeing_capital_desc:0 "With Equestria torn apart, numerous rich ponies are fleeing their homeland with their valuables and their riches. Many are heading for sunnier pastures elsewhere in the hopes of finding a safe home.\n\nIt is here we come in. As a part of Equestria never touched by war, we are in a prime position to move in and secure both ponies and capital."
 EQC_NLR_the_rule_of_law:0 "Reaffirm Secular Rule"
 EQC_NLR_the_rule_of_law_desc:0 "Though the Queen of the Night has established her rule across ponykind, there remains many ponies in New Mareland who believe in a different creed. In the interests of pragmatism and to spare the nation from any further harm to it, we will adopt a position of a firm separation of religion and government. The last we need is another war."
 EQC_NLR_new_education_reforms:0 "Nopony Left Behind"
 EQC_NLR_new_education_reforms_desc:0 "Though we boast a well-developed nation and an intelligentsia at least as good, there are several ponies in New Mareland who are left behind as the school system leaves them in the dust, without care for them. We need a national standard for education and testing to make sure that every foal has a good school to attend."
 EQC_NLR_introduce_new_currency:0 "The Imperial Bit"
 EQC_NLR_introduce_new_currency_desc:0 "Though we've been tied to Equestria for many years, the currency slowly drifted longer and longer away from Equestria until the first New Marelander Bit was struck. As part of a demand and request from Canterlot, we will bring our currency in line with Equestria once more, but this time under the Lunar Empire, and their Imperial Bit."
 EQC_NLR_bat_equality:0 "Pass the Thestral Citizenship Act"
 EQC_NLR_bat_equality_desc:0 "There are three tribes, ponies have been taught. Not entirely correct. A fourth tribe, the thestrals have lived in the shadows of society, isolated from the rest of society. But they shall be pariahs no more. We will recognize them as true citizens of New Mareland, with all the rights and privileges associated forthwith. A nation that cannot take care of everyone is no nation at all."
 EQC_NLR_new_constitution:0 "Constitutional Rule"
 EQC_NLR_new_constitution_desc:0 "There is one law that stands above all else, even the requests from Canterlot. The Constitution of New Mareland. It is unquestionably the supreme law of the land, and nothing shall be able to circumvent or be repugnant to it. Even if lights go out all across the world and equine rights become nothing but a whisper elsewhere, we will stay strong as a nation of laws and a nation on solid ground."
 EQC_NLR_infrastrucutre_improvements:0 "Inter-Mareland Highway System"
 EQC_NLR_infrastrucutre_improvements_desc:0 "A newfangled invention has won widespread support in and around New Mareland. The highway. With an industry able to take up the new economy and help revive the cities, the Inter-Mareland Highway System will be the envy of the world. For a continent where carts and carriages can still be found in several places, we will look like a scene from the future."
 EQC_NLR_parks:0 "Parks And Recreation Act"
 EQC_NLR_parks_desc:0 "Strength through Joy.\n\nA staple of many slogans in the world, but for us, it needs to be more than a slogan. We need places where the ponies can go on holiday, or just out for a weekend when the urban life gets too much and they need a small sanctuary outside of the cities. Swathes of forest and prime lakefront will be protected for now and for the future."
 EQC_NLR_independence_negotiations:0 "Independence Negotiations"
 EQC_NLR_independence_negotiations_desc:0 "Though we are bound as one to Equestria and to the Lunar Empire, there are quite simply many expenses in keeping up with a colony or nation an ocean away from the metropole. Both sides of the Celestial Ocean have recognized this with an increasing number of ponies being aware of this with every passing day. In this, we will go to Canterlot and work out an arrangement that works for us all."
 EQC_NLR_regulated_shadowbolts:0 "A Friendlier Shadowbolt Society"
 EQC_NLR_regulated_shadowbolts_desc:0 "There are many reasons why ponies don't really like the Shadowbolts. Their secrecy, all the stories that the rumour mill is peddling for each day that goes by about some arcane, bestialic ritual. This cannot stand and way become something worse. We need to open up the Shadowbolts for the camera, and, if nothing else, at least give the impression that it is nothing but a club for ponies with too much time."
 EQC_NLR_shadowbolt_investment:0 "Friends In Dark Places"
 EQC_NLR_shadowbolt_investment_desc:0 "And yet, the Shadowbolts are also very useful for the kinds of issues that the government cannot be seen openly doing. As a private society, whatever the Shadowbolts get up to, is not the business of the Government of New Mareland unless it is illegal. If there is a damaging rumour or story, they will be able to take of it before it hits the public discourse to the detriment of all."
 EQC_NLR_new_oil_projects:0 "The Empire's Oilwell"
 EQC_NLR_new_oil_projects_desc:0 "Below several lands in New Mareland lies great oil reserves, undisturbed ever since they were discovered some years ago. With the recent focus on autarky from the Empress, it is time that those same oil reserves were put to good use. For though the Ponyville Plain is the breadbasket, we will deliver the liquid that keeps the modern civilization running smoothly."
 EQC_NLR_shadowbolts_focus:0 "The Shadowbolt Society"
 EQC_NLR_shadowbolts_focus_desc:0 "Legend says the Shadowbolt Society was founded 2,000 years ago by the original Shadowbolts who served Nightmare Moon. Others say the name is pure coincidence. What is true, however, is that the many of the most influential ponies in New Mareland are members of this Society and they have no qualms with assisting Nightmare Moon if it means keeping their heads."
 EQC_NLR_the_new_shadowbolts:0 "The New Society"
 EQC_NLR_the_new_shadowbolts_desc:0 "We shall not be the Shadowbolts of old. The times, they are changing and the world with it. We must adapt to changing circumstances and make sure that we do not fall behind the wagon, lest we become a relic of the past like so many other societies before us. We must, in the words of another pony, adapt or die."
 EQC_NLR_the_old_shadowbolts:0 "A Return To Our Roots"
 EQC_NLR_the_old_shadowbolts_desc:0 "The Winds of Change are blowing across New Mareland.\n\nAnd they are, in the wider sense, irrelevant. The largess and glamour of changing does not compare to the old ways which has served us so well over these past many, many years. When the winds blow, we stand fast on our place, in the face of adversity from inside or outside."
 EQC_NLR_industrial_security_act:0 "The Industrial Security Act"
 EQC_NLR_industrial_security_act_desc:0 "Around New Mareland, many companies are teetering on the brink of collapse, unable to fin enough contracts or customers to keep the lights on ever since Black Wednesday. What seemed like a lost year has now turned into a lost decade. But there seems to be hope. If we can support and secure our industry and make sure that those that fail do not drag the rest down, we might make it out of this alive."
 EQC_NLR_implement_corporatism:0 "Shadowbolt Capitalism"
 EQC_NLR_implement_corporatism_desc:0 "The business interests in New Mareland have a lot of things in common with us. Large wealth, desire to operate almost free of constraints and a good understanding of our place in the world. And yet, no one has been reaching out between the two to set up a more permanent relationship. One that may turn out, if implemented to be very fruitful for both parties to engage in."
 EQC_NLR_use_the_cinema:0 "The Birth Of Mareland"
 EQC_NLR_use_the_cinema_desc:0 "There are many newfangled ways of getting a message out to the masses and none has proven more effective than the motion pictures. The ways that we can massage public opinion for, or against an ideal or purpose is a wonderful new perk that has been unavailable until now. And with the dual problem of griffons and Celestia supporters still nascent, one of the interns had a very good idea lately."
 EQC_NLR_an_industrial_education:0 "Industrial Education"
 EQC_NLR_an_industrial_education_desc:0 "We must make sure that there is a strong base of knowledge to work from in New Mareland to ensure a new future for the nation. What is needed is not just the old science base, or the industrial sector that we have currently, but one that can go on to the future, one that can compete in the future. An industrial future, one of highly-educated workers that can turn out machines of today and tomorrow."
 EQC_NLR_family_programs:0 "Encourage Family Programs"
 EQC_NLR_family_programs_desc:0 "If there is one unit from which everything springs, it is the family. It is the family that operates as the base and core unit in the world and one that should be protected and empowered. And encouraging the individual families to set up their own programmes and their own small shops might just be the thing we are looking for."
 EQC_NLR_corporate_militarism:0 "Corporate Militarism"
 EQC_NLR_corporate_militarism_desc:0 "One thing that New Mareland has always had is heavy and secondary industry. Steel, aluminium, planes and cars. Though they are primarily used by civilians, they also have a dual purpose. War. The planes and cars that carry ponies and cargo can also carry bombs and grenades. We need to make the companies aware of this, and note that a small amount of contracts might be their way if they comply."
 EQC_NLR_economic_shocktherapy:0 "Economic Shock Therapy"
 EQC_NLR_economic_shocktherapy_desc:0 "There are several parts of the economy which are running at an, at best, sluggish pace. This is not just in one sector, but spread across multiple sectors. But in this environment we can't afford to have an economy at half speed. We must, at its base apply rapid loosening of restrictions and let the economy breathe free once more."
 EQC_NLR_grant_bats_equality:0 "Embrace the Thestrals"
 EQC_NLR_grant_bats_equality_desc:0 "When the War raged, there was one tribe that was loyal almost to a pony to the Night. The thestrals worked in tandem with the Empress during the war and were rewarded for it across the Ocean. But not here. This is a grave injustice that must be fixed. At the very least, the thestrals can be granted full equality with other ponies in New Mareland."
 EQC_NLR_convinct_leasing:0 "Convict Leasing"
 EQC_NLR_convinct_leasing_desc:0 "There is a dire lack of a skilled workforce in the nation, and even less cash to go around thanks to the war as of late. Fortunately, there is a very large population of 'willing' workers ready to work throughout the day without any sense of such things as 'unions' or 'higher wages'\n\nPrisoners."
 EQC_NLR_local_shadowbolt_lodges:0 "The Fourth Branch Of the Government"
 EQC_NLR_local_shadowbolt_lodges_desc:0 "Schoolfoals are taught that we have a legislative, executive and judicial branch of government. Three in one. But what happens when they end up in a fight? What happens when they cannot agree? This is where the Shadowbolts come in. As the arbiter of their members, to which almost all ponies of note belong, they are in a unique position to mediate between squabbling branches whenever necessary."
 EQC_NLR_put_the_griffons_in_their_place:0 "Pass the Alien And Sedition Act"
 EQC_NLR_put_the_griffons_in_their_place_desc:0 "Though our rule seems safe, there are enemies all around us. Aliens going around the nation, plotting the very destruction of New Mareland. They live among us, never once showing their true allegiance until they decide to strike.\n\nWe must strike first, and make sure that they will not be able to carry out their plans."
 EQC_NLR_the_elders:0 "Protocols Of the Elders Of Griffonstone"
 EQC_NLR_the_elders_desc:0 "There are many books that tell of the griffons beyond out borders. And one of the newer ones is one from an unknown author, talking about a plan that the griffons have laid in secret to dominate not just Griffonia, involving us and the Riverponies, but indeed the whole world. If we do not stay on watch, then there may well be a fifth column within our land that must be rooted out."
 EQC_NLR_extend_membership:0 "Expand the Shadowbolt Society"
 EQC_NLR_extend_membership_desc:0 "The Shadowbolts in their current form have served us well, as their influence grows, so does the need for more members that can take care of the many, many, machinations they have going. We need to take charge and push for a greater membership to make sure that the membership fits the purpose."
 EQC_NLR_united_shadow_works:0 "United Shadow Works"
 EQC_NLR_united_shadow_works_desc:0 "Many of New Mareland's largest corporations are run by members of the Shadowbolt Society. Now that the Society is overseeing the nation, these assets can be safely nationalised into one single Shadowbolt corporation. After all, nothing will really change."
 EQC_NLR_embrace_the_night:0 "Embrace the Night"
 EQC_NLR_embrace_the_night_desc:0 "No one in New Mareland was willing or was able to take the job as Governor-General of the place. It is necessary to send a pony who has the guts and has the necessary skills required to pacify this little place so that it may become a loyal province of the Empire.\nEvening Dew."
 EQC_NLR_coopt_the_shadowbolts:0 "Radicalise the Shadowbolt Society"
 EQC_NLR_coopt_the_shadowbolts_desc:0 "The Shadowbolts are a good place to start off with. They are already loyal to us, and have a core of dedicated members that we can work with to expand it. But they are lacking in...dedication to the Empress. Not to worry. We will make sure that they see the proper way of the Empress so that they can serve in the best way possible."
 EQC_NLR_scientific_modernisation:0 "Eliminate Scientific Boundaries"
 EQC_NLR_scientific_modernisation_desc:0 "The dogmatic ideas of what can and cannot be done in the name of science needs to be done away with. We are standing on the edge of several breakthroughs that can propel us more than a decade into the future. We should not be burdened with such things as 'morality' to stop us from enjoying those fruits of our labour."
 EQC_NLR_immediate_equality:0 "Thestral Equality Edict"
 EQC_NLR_immediate_equality_desc:0 "The Empress doth decree her wishes from time to time, and this time is no different. She has handed down a decree stating her will and pleasure is to have the Thestrals integrated with the rest of New Mareland with all necessary and deliberate speed so that they may continue to enjoy their lives, now out of the shadows and into the glorious moonlight that radiates out over the world."
 EQC_NLR_imperial_donation:0 "An Imperial Donation"
 EQC_NLR_imperial_donation_desc:0 "Her Empress and Lunar Majesty, Nightmare Moon has graciously decided to help out our ailing economy with a large cash injection to the most vulnerable places in the economy, with the hope of revitalization. We sned out thanks to the Empress, and our humble gratitudes for her donation to New Mareland."
 EQC_NLR_national_rebirth:0 "One Nation Under the Nightmare"
 EQC_NLR_national_rebirth_desc:0 "The ponies of New Mareland now live under the watchful eye of the Empress, where they can sleep and live, happily knowing that the Nightmare will make sure that they do not suffer the indignity of a visit from Celestia loyalists or the griffon coming for a visit. They will now all know that the Nightmare protect."
 EQC_NLR_the_wickedness_of_griffonkind:0 "The Wickedness Of Griffonkind"
 EQC_NLR_the_wickedness_of_griffonkind_desc:0 "There is a scourge beyond our borders. The Griffons. In their incursions against the Riverponies, they have torn them limb from limb, forced them into slavery and worse. The griffons are, in all their creature, the natural enemies of all equinity. It needs to be the duty of everypony in New Mareland, as the final outpost on Griffonia to be on watch for the Griffon threat."
 EQC_NLR_the_nightmares_eyes:0 "The Eyes Of the Nightmare"
 EQC_NLR_the_nightmares_eyes_desc:0 "We are no longer some backwater colony of Equestria, so far away to be forgotten about in daily speech.\n\nWe are New Mareland, the first and final bastion of the Nightmare on Griffonia. We stand as a proud vanguard of the Empress, defending the Night until our very end of our life."
 EQC_NLR_coopt_the_segregationists:0 "The Picket-Dew Pact"
 EQC_NLR_coopt_the_segregationists_desc:0 "Picket Fence and Evening Dew. Two ponies who shouldn't have things in common. One who has fierce loyalty to the Night, another who stood for patriation. And there is yet still things that unite them. Hatred of griffons.\n\nTogether they have formulated a plan to give Picket a blank check on his plans. As long as Evening Dew knows."
 EQC_NLR_work_camps_for_griffons:0 "Redemptionary Camps"
 EQC_NLR_work_camps_for_griffons_desc:0 "Though the griffons may be loathsome creatures, who have no right to live in New Mareland, they are still creatures with a brain and two limbs who can work for the betterment of society. Their crimes against the state will be worked off in Redemption Camps located in remote regions where we can securely monitor them for any subversive activities."
 EQC_NLR_national_tithe:0 "The National Tithe"
 EQC_NLR_national_tithe_desc:0 "There is to be a complete overhaul of the taxes. The tax code, long an unwieldy and unreasonably long one needs to be slimmed down. Very slimmed down. The taxes will be replaced by tithes on every step of income that is earned. While this will cost us a bit, the economy getting back up into gear will be more than worth it."
 EQC_NLR_expel_the_savages:0 "Expel the Savages"
 EQC_NLR_expel_the_savages_desc:0 "We can now take the final step towards the solution to the Griffon problem. We have no use for them anywhere in our fair community and we do not intend to find a use for them. They will not be shown any deference, but an open door and a firm demand to get out of the nation to their kin in Aquilea and Wingbardy."
 EQC_NLR_soldiers_of_the_night:0 "Soldiers Of the Night"
 EQC_NLR_soldiers_of_the_night_desc:0 "We are the Soldiers of the Night. The Vanguard of the Nightmare and the First to Fight. We stand against all enemies of the Empress, griffons, ponies or anyone else. Let the enemies rue this day that we rose from New Mareland's hard soil to challenge those that seek to destroy us."
 EQC_NLR_the_prophet:0 "The Prophet"
 EQC_NLR_the_prophet_desc:0 "Evening Dew has served the Empress well. Very well indeed during her appointment as Governor-General of New Mareland. There has even been talk in the wings of the palace and in the capital that there might be another thing in the works for her.\n\nA new title, one that will signify her place as an extension of the will of the Empress maybe. Maybe it is just talk, but an envoy has been rumoured to be underway."
 EQC_NLR_spread_the_darkness:0 "Spread the Darkness"
 EQC_NLR_spread_the_darkness_desc:0 "Just beyond our borders lies the ancestral enemy of the ponies. The griffons. Their 'Kingdom' in Wingbardy has grown fat off the sweat of ponies and has as its goal the subsumation of New Mareland into itself, to the horror and shock of everyone. We must strike first before they can gather and take spread the Nightmare all the way out into Griffonia. To Karthrin. And beyond."

 ### EVENTS ###
 EQC_NLR.1.t:0 "The Sunset Question"
 EQC_NLR.1.d:0 "We have secured the country at large and the time has come to wipe our territory clean of any vile Celestial titles. Where better to start with than our capital of course! Shall the capital's administration make ready to re-title itself to the proud city of Midnight?"

 EQC_NLR.3.d:0 "Her Majesty, Nightmare Moon, offered the Shadowbolt Society stewardship of New Mareland and after a near unanimous vote (under the watchful eye of Nightmare Moon herself), it was accepted. However, the society is split on how closely we follow the doctrine of our new Empress. Shall we fully embrace the darkness? Or shall we retain the New Mareland Spirit we were all borne with?\n\nWhatever we decide, we must do so soon, or risk ruin."
 EQC_NLR.3.a:0 "We need not soak ourselves in darkness to be followers of the Night. We shall embrace the New Shadowbolts."
