JRR_legacy_of_serfdom_desc:0 "Serfdom in Westkeep has a long and storied history, considered a backwater of the realm, agricultural serfs were a major part of the economy. While the practice was officially abolished within the Marquisate in the year 978, the rural nature of the region and the entrenched nobility that controls much of it means that while the system may be gone, the issues remain." #tl:dr Serfdom in Westkeep was only officially abolished in 978, and even in spite of that the region remains largely rural with a large class of wealthy landowners and what not

### Focuses ###
JRR_a1:0 "The Patriotic Fiefdom"
JRR_a1_desc:0 "The MPA are the true warriors of Aquileia, true and strong. Ready to do anything to fight for a pure future for this land. We are a diverse group, but we are entirely united behind this great task, out with the King."
JRR_a2:0 "The Fighting Coqs"
JRR_a2_desc:0 "Those rulers in Aquila do not understand the citizens of Westkeep. Those urbanists look down on us and poor and dirty, when it is they who have been corrupted. The aristocratic elites have put a sheet over their eyes and corrupted them with Herzlandish nonsense. We will restore the true Aquileia, the Aquileia of the peasant."
JRR_a3:0 "The Cercle Closes"
JRR_a3_desc:0 "The time is now, my brothers and sisters. The Cercle is ready to fight for the freedom of nature against the corruption of the land. Arcturius looks down upon us fondly, and blesses our fight. Our freedom will be won by the blood, so let us begin."
JRR_a4:0 "The Colonel's Forces"
JRR_a4_desc:0 "The Colonel is a rallying point for the true patriots of the MPA who refuse to work with the Herzlandish sympathizer Rodier. Every day griffons and ponies from accross the land arrive to be trained by the MPA. Officially of course, these recruits are loyal monarchists. We'll show them how much of a lie that really is."
JRR_a5:0 "Refurbish Township Fairgrounds"
JRR_a5_desc:0 "The fairground has long been the center of life in Westkeep. Life in the town has become corrupted by values from the capital, and so we must restore what was lost. The fairground shall be once again the center of the community, with freecreatures of all sorts meeting to exchange goods and participate in their Westkeep heritage."
JRR_a6:0 "From Guilds To Unions"
JRR_a6_desc:0 "The guilds have long been our allies against the nobles and the Marquess. For generations, the true creatures of Westkeep tried to wrest control of the economy from the corrupt nobles, to protect the prosperity of the common griffons and ponies. But now their model has become outdated, we shall help them with moving into the future by reforming their guild structure into a union one, to continue their fight in the modern age."
JRR_a7:0 "Prioritise Agrarian Reforms"
JRR_a7_desc:0 "The age of serfs still hangs heavy over Westkeep, when the nobles of the land tried to force the peasants to adopt the despotic ways of the herzland. Their estates dominated the land, and the peasant cried out for someone to save them. The revolutionaries answered, but soon they too were corrupted. Now it falls to us to cut the final shackles from their claws and hooves and to right the order of the land."
JRR_a8:0 "Storm The Castles"
JRR_a8_desc:0 "The nobles are hiding something in their castles. We know not what, it could be weapons, money, the Marquess perhaps, but they have become even more secretive of late. We must blow open the door, expose them all to the justice of the people."
JRR_a9:0 "Rouse The Peasants"
JRR_a9_desc:0 "The peasants understand! They know the pain they have been put through at the hands of the unfaithful, those who profess their love for an impure King and a false society. Soon they shall know even more, but for now, they are ready to fight. And that is enough."
JRR_a10:0 "Gather The Hunters"
JRR_a10_desc:0 "Rouge Guirlande's natural society and hiking group are known as The Hunters. A relatively simple name for what lies beneath. For they do not hunt nature, but those who wish to harm it. Let the corrupted come, they shall pay the price."
JRR_a11:0 "The Bulwark Strategy"
JRR_a11_desc:0 "Our land can be easily defended, with rivers and mountains protecting our heartland, we can hold out against the forces of reaction and dégénération."
JRR_a12:0 "Our Talons Bared"
JRR_a12_desc:0 "Odds are we will end up surrounded during the revolution. Rila sympathizes with the revolution, but they are just as corrupted as the monarchy, and so they must too be wiped out. The only way to achieve a total victory for our forces is to strike out, to bring down each of the vassals before bringing down the King in Aquila himself. "
JRR_a13:0 "Reform Township Citizenship Laws"
JRR_a13_desc:0 "To be a citizen in a Westkeep town under the noble regime, they placed the ridiculous restriction of needing to own a stone house within a city along with other insane limits. To deny the right of citizenship to creatures is to deny them their nation and their very spirit. This wrong must be righted by true patriots."
JRR_a14:0 "Standardise Westkeepian Statute Laws"
JRR_a14_desc:0 "Westkeep's legal code is bound up in centuries of royal decrees, Marquisatal ordinances, and the rights of the old nobility. With Colette's help, we shall sweep that all away and implement a new law code following our principles of fraternité and the peasants' right."
JRR_a15:0 "Offer Compensation To The Landlords"
JRR_a15_desc:0 "While the idea disgusts us, sometimes we must take a peaceful approach to the landlords of Westkeep. Some of them are reasonable creatures, simply blinded by urbanist lies. And while some of the money we give them may one day be turned against us, to avoid a chance of violence is a noble pursuit in its own right."
JRR_a16:0 "An Unrelenting Tide Of Coqs"
JRR_a16_desc:0 "It is time my brothers and sisters! Unleash the Coqs accross the province, the nobles cannot stop all of us! Coqiste organizers have drummed up support from the peasantry and Colette is ready to make the decree. The land of the nobles shall be theirs no longer, it shall be overrun with the true patriots of Aquileia."
JRR_a17:0 "Operation: Broken Lance"
JRR_a17_desc:0 "The decadent and pompous nobles are one of the Marquess' only backers in the region. They are an entrenched group, having near total control over Westkeep for centuries. But we put the first chip in their armor when we took over the province, and now it is time to deal the final blow. The nobility must be purged."
JRR_a18:0 "Operation: Outlaw"
JRR_a18_desc:0 "The outlaw Marquess must be discovered and made to pay for the crimes she has committed against Westkeep and all of Aquelia. And once the head of the snake is cut off, we can be sure the loyal servants of the MPA will have full control over the province for... no reason in particular."
JRR_a19:0 "The Bunloe-Angaz Line"
JRR_a19_desc:0 "The mountains and rivers of our land can form an impenetrable line of defense with some effort. Bunkers will line the hills, and machine-gun nests will stop the invaders in their tracks. We will never surrender this bastion of purity to the corrupted!"
JRR_a20:0 "The Camaris Trail"
JRR_a20_desc:0 "We've contacted a group of smugglers from Camris in Pomovarra who can plug us into a network stretching from Flowena to Skyfall, securing us a stable supply of weapons for our fight."
JRR_a21:0 "Optimise Logistics"
JRR_a21_desc:0 "Railroads in Westkeep are far behind the rest of the nation, and aren't good enough to get the supplies we need to the front. We need to improve our logistical structure to be ready to fight back against the reactionary forces."
JRR_a22:0 "Shock Squad Tactics"
JRR_a22_desc:0 "Squads of our most loyal and skilled soldiers will lead the assault on enemy positions to create opportunities for the rest of the army to achieve their goals. They are our sword and shield, the vanguard of a new army and a new nation."
JRR_a23:0 "Utilise The Marginaliste"
JRR_a23_desc:0 "There is a class of creatures at the edge of our society, those who do not fit into the social order of the urbanists. They live in the cities but have no homes, they wander the streets looking for a purpose. They are the traveling merchants, the prostituées, those who society rejects. They are the consequences of the urbanist dégénération that has overtaken our land, and we can show them a brighter future."
JRR_a24:0 "Barter With The Crafthounds Of Angaz-Barak"
JRR_a24_desc:0 "The hold of Angaz-Barak has been a long supporter of the nobles of Westkeep. Their relationship runs so deep that it is said their leader is privy to more of the secrets of the land than the Marquess herself. Even more unfortunately, their hostility to our movement is well known. Let us pay them a visit for some negotiations."
JRR_a25:0 "Farmers Not Serfs"
JRR_a25_desc:0 "Give the land unto the tiller, and they shall prosper. To deprive a creature of their Arcturius-given right to land is to deprive them of their livelihood and culture. This is the final goal of our quest, to return to citizens of Westkeep to the land, which shall return them to their authentic culture, their true heritage, the genuine spirit of holy Aquileia."
JRR_a26:0 "Anti-Landlord Proscriptions"
JRR_a26_desc:0 "Let the landlords bleed! They are the tools of the decadent urbanists by their own will or by the corruption in their blood. Only their deaths will constitute repentance for their generational sins. Their consorting with herzlanders will be their death sentence."
JRR_a27:0 "Operation: Backfire"
JRR_a27_desc:0 "The forest is our weapon, the rivers our shield, and the mountains are our armor. And if the enemy is to take them, we shall fight on our own terf. Tunnels, mines, traps, kill zones, all are justified tools for the defense of this land. It has protected us and showed us the way, so we shall give everything to pay back that favor."
JRR_a28:0 "Establish The Partisan Central Command"
JRR_a28_desc:0 "We are outnumbered and outgunned. We will likely lose land to the invader, but there is still hope. Our brave warriors will fight behind their lines and strike their logistics. Governed by one central council led by Rouge Guirlande, they will become our warriors in the dark, our final line of defense."
JRR_a29:0 "Rifle Modernisation"
JRR_a29_desc:0 "We don't have the quality of weapons the central government does. But we have sympathizers in the army, and we can get a shipment of modern rifles sent to us, along with the designs for how to make more."
JRR_a30:0 "The Regional Emergency Grain Depot"
JRR_a30_desc:0 "The war will inevitably do great harm to our citizens. This is a regretful necessity in the age of national cleansing. So we must prepare for this, and try our best to alleviate the suffering of the people in these times of violence."
JRR_a31:0 "Bite And Hold Tactics"
JRR_a31_desc:0 "Extreme aggression followed by a defensive pivot, to bite and to hold. That is what we will need to do for our army to win this war. It will be a long and hard fight, but it will all be worth it in the end when our army storms the city of Aquila, ready to free the nation from its shackles."

### Events ###
westkeep.1.t:0 "The Colonel and The Marquess"
westkeep.1.d:0 ">>>>CHOUETTE REPORT<<<<\n\nFor approved eyes only.\n\nThe situation in Westkeep is tenuous, and King Moriset seems to not care. His cousin, the Marquess, is still on the run, and the MPA has been uncooperative in our efforts to track her down. They say they can handle the investigation themselves, but this report presents a more significant threat.\n\nWe believe that the MPA in Westkeep may be plotting against the throne. With all royal institutions in the province effectively destroyed, the MPA has nearly full control over the state apparatus, and their nationalism seems to only be on the rise. While we have previously trusted them to remain loyal to the crown, it seems they are slowly revealing a secret agenda. A cabal of three leaders within the MPA together form the backbone of their power, with Colonel Colette serving as the public face of the province, with the other two taking a back seat. More time is needed to investigate. However, they are both extremely populist and nationalist.\n\nOur investigation into the Marquess has returned equally unexpected results. We sighted her once with a pony noble named Lance Incarnat, who seems active within aristocratic social circles from the number of nobles who have at least heard of him. Additionally, we have received no cooperation from the majority of the nobles in the region, especially those in the mountainous regions, and the Diamond Dogs also claim to have no information on the Marquess. Our conclusion is that there is something deeply strange happening among the nobility of Westkeep, and we cannot figure out what. Whenever we believe we have a lead, all our informants and tips disappear into the night.\n\nWestkeep is on an edge, and this report has no correct answer of how to fix it."
westkeep.1.a:0 "The Marquess, and her erstwhile allies seem interesting"
westkeep.1.b:0 "These MPA folks sure sound like fine people!"

### Character Descriptions ###
JRR_COLETTE_SOLIDE_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 17th of March, 972 in Aquila\n\n§YRank§!: Colonel\n\n§YBiography§!: Colette Solide was born to a family of soldiers in the Aquileian capital in the lead-up to the sea change that was the revolutions of 978. When the revolutionaries rose up and took Aquila, her father left to fight for the republic, leaving her mother and her behind. Surviving on money they had saved, Colette's mother told her how brave her father was for fighting for their freedom. When her father returned home, he was extatic, he had fought for liberty and won, but it all came crashing down four years later. When Albert Bertholot led his counter-revolution, the republican army crumbled before him. Still, Colette's father went out to fight once again. Alas, while he was gone, tragedy struck. As the battle for Aquila raged, Colette was in the crossfire. As cannon crashed around them, a piece of shrapnel struck young Colette in the right eye, permanently blinding her.\n\nWhen Colette's father returned, he was horrified. His misery became anger as he constantly ranted about how weak the republic was to lose so quickly and to let this happen to his daughter. He decided that Colette must too be a soldier despite her injury to make Aquelia stronger and purify it of the weakness that had hurt her. Years later, and Colette joined the army, quickly joining the MPA and moving up the ranks with that organization's help. Here, she was introduced to the works of writers like Guilo Beakolini and Duke Haygle, which meshed well with her personal ideas regarding strength.\n\nSoon she became Aide de Camp to Leonard Rodier, the MPA's Marshal, and was... disappointed, to say the least. She believed she would be meeting the griffon who would cleanse the nation of weakness through Aquelian pride, and found he was no more nationalist than most of the griffs she had met up until that point. Growing bored with the mainstream MPA, she worked with the organization's right fringe to get an appointment under the governor of Westkeep General Thomas Reiany. Swiftly eliminating the old general, she blamed the murder on the Marquess and became the sole legitimate power in the region. Partnering with a local nationalist group and the rest of the MPA's far-right fringe, she rules Westkeep with an iron claw, waiting for the day she can make the nation truly strong.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Niezow"

JRR_angaz_barak:0 "The Hold Of Angaz-Barak"
JRR_angaz_barak_desc:0 "§YLeader§!: Rufus Ironbark\n\n§YHold History§!: During the 630s, splinter clans from the diamond dog hold of Karaz-Drynburaz began the march west through Verenia, looking for a new home. They arrived in the hills and mountains of Westkeep, the first tie they had found terrain amenable to hold construction since they left on their journey. Soon after beginning construction, the diamond dog miners encountered representatives of the Aquelian Kingdom, already established in the area. The representatives of the King and the Diamond dog clans hashed out a basic agreement, opening trade between their two peoples, and allowing the dogs to live there in exchange for a yearly tribute.\n\nOver time, the diamond dogs became more connected to and reliant on the griffons of Aquileia. Needing to import food to support a growing population, the hold's economy became more and more connected with the griffons outside. So instead of offering goods to the griffons, they offered their services as craftscreatures. The local Westkeep lords happily paid the dogs in coin and crops for their excellent craftsmanship. This relationship has gone on for hundreds of years, with each Forgelord meeting with a council of nobles and renewing the sacred contract. Over time the system evolved, with skilled griffon enchanters augmenting the diamond dog forging process, producing the most refined forgeries of the entirety of Aquelia, rivaled only by the dogs of Bronzehill on the Griffonian continent.\n\nThroughout the politics of the centuries, the dogs of Angaz-Barak have generally been ambivalent to the political sea-changes. Maintaining loyalty to the regional nobility rather than any great hierarchy. However, when the revolution of 978 came, the dogs refused to help the republican cause, shut their forges for the first time in years, and sheltered many local Westkeep nobles. The Forgelord at the time, Barnoth Longfur met with a council of nobles, and helped general Thomas Reiany restore order to the province. With the ancient compact restored, the forges were lit again, and once more weapons were produced in the halls of Angaz-Barak."
