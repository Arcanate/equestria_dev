### Character Descriptions ###
JRR_COLETTE_SOLIDE_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 17th of March, 972 in Aquila\n\n§YRank§!: Colonel\n\n§YBiography§!: Colette Solide was born to a family of soldiers in the Aquileian capital in the lead-up to the sea change that was the revolutions of 978. When the revolutionaries rose up and took Aquila, her father left to fight for the republic, leaving her mother and her behind. Surviving on money they had saved, Colette's mother told her how brave her father was for fighting for their freedom. When her father returned home, he was extatic, he had fought for liberty and won, but it all came crashing down four years later. When Albert Bertholot led his counter-revolution, the republican army crumbled before him. Still, Colette's father went out to fight once again. Alas, while he was gone, tragedy struck. As the battle for Aquila raged, Colette was in the crossfire. As cannon crashed around them, a piece of shrapnel struck young Colette in the right eye, permanently blinding her.\n\nWhen Colette's father returned, he was horrified. His misery became anger as he constantly ranted about how weak the republic was to lose so quickly and to let this happen to his daughter. He decided that Colette must too be a soldier despite her injury to make Aquelia stronger and purify it of the weakness that had hurt her. Years later, and Colette joined the army, quickly joining the MPA and moving up the ranks with that organization's help. Here, she was introduced to the works of writers like Guilo Beakolini and Duke Haygle, which meshed well with her personal ideas regarding strength.\n\nSoon she became Aide de Camp to Leonard Rodier, the MPA's Marshal, and was... disappointed, to say the least. She believed she would be meeting the griffon who would cleanse the nation of weakness through Aquelian pride, and found he was no more nationalist than most of the griffs she had met up until that point. Growing bored with the mainstream MPA, she worked with the organization's right fringe to get an appointment under the governor of Westkeep General Thomas Reiany. Swiftly eliminating the old general, she blamed the murder on the Marquess and became the sole legitimate power in the region. Partnering with a local nationalist group and the rest of the MPA's far-right fringe, she rules Westkeep with an iron claw, waiting for the day she can make the nation truly strong.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Niezow"

JRR_angaz_barak:0 "The Hold Of Angaz-Barak"
JRR_angaz_barak_desc:0 "§YLeader§!: Rufus Ironbark\n\n§YHold History§!: During the 630s, splinter clans from the diamond dog hold of Karaz-Drynburaz began the march west through Verenia, looking for a new home. They arrived in the hills and mountains of Westkeep, the first tie they had found terrain amenable to hold construction since they left on their journey. Soon after beginning construction, the diamond dog miners encountered representatives of the Aquelian Kingdom, already established in the area. The representatives of the King and the Diamond dog clans hashed out a basic agreement, opening trade between their two peoples, and allowing the dogs to live there in exchange for a yearly tribute.\n\nOver time, the diamond dogs became more connected to and reliant on the griffons of Aquileia. Needing to import food to support a growing population, the hold's economy became more and more connected with the griffons outside. So instead of offering goods to the griffons, they offered their services as craftscreatures. The local Westkeep lords happily paid the dogs in coin and crops for their excellent craftsmanship. This relationship has gone on for hundreds of years, with each Forgelord meeting with a council of nobles and renewing the sacred contract. Over time the system evolved, with skilled griffon enchanters augmenting the diamond dog forging process, producing the most refined forgeries of the entirety of Aquelia, rivaled only by the dogs of Bronzehill on the Griffonian continent.\n\nThroughout the politics of the centuries, the dogs of Angaz-Barak have generally been ambivalent to the political sea-changes. Maintaining loyalty to the regional nobility rather than any great hierarchy. However, when the revolution of 978 came, the dogs refused to help the republican cause, shut their forges for the first time in years, and sheltered many local Westkeep nobles. The Forgelord at the time, Barnoth Longfur met with a council of nobles, and helped general Thomas Reiany restore order to the province. With the ancient compact restored, the forges were lit again, and once more weapons were produced in the halls of Angaz-Barak."
