 ### FOCUS ###
 EQC_NLR_reorganise_the_government:0 "Reorganise the Government"
 EQC_NLR_reorganise_the_government_desc:0 "Jet Set has proven himself enough to warrant a second chance at power under her Majesty. His peers, meanwhile, have not and must be replaced by far more credible citizens of the new Lunar Empire. Many of those are likely to be fellow thestrals who have long since been cheated out of any position of power previously under Celestia's rule."
 EQC_NLR_welcome_refugees:0 "Welcome Civil War Refugees"
 EQC_NLR_welcome_refugees_desc:0 "During the civil war, numerous ponies were displaced from their homes, scarred and driven on the run due to the destruction that the war brought to all corners of Equestria. But there was one bastion of ponykind that barely saw any fighting. New Mareland. Shielded by the oceans, it stands unblemished and untouched. In the interest of friendship, let us open our doors for them."
 EQC_NLR_fleeing_capital:0 "Poach the Fleeing Capital"
 EQC_NLR_fleeing_capital_desc:0 "With Equestria torn apart, numerous rich ponies are fleeing their homeland with their valuables and their riches. Many are heading for sunnier pastures elsewhere in the hopes of finding a safe home.\nIt is here we come in. As a part of Equestria never touched by war, we are in a prime position to move in and secure both ponies and capital."
 EQC_NLR_the_rule_of_law:0 "Reaffirm Secular Rule"
 EQC_NLR_the_rule_of_law_desc:0 "Though the Queen of the Night has established her rule across ponykind, there remains many ponies in New Mareland who believe in a different creed. In the interests of pragmatism and to spare the nation from any further harm to it, we will adopt a position of a firm separation of religion and government. The last we need is another war."
 EQC_NLR_new_education_reforms:0 "Nopony Left Behind"
 EQC_NLR_new_education_reforms_desc:0 "Though we boast a well-developed nation and an intelligentsia at least as good, there are several ponies in New Mareland who are left behind as the school system leaves them in the dust, without care for them. We need a national standard for education and testing to make sure that every foal has a good school to attend."
 EQC_NLR_introduce_new_currency:0 "The Imperial Bit"
 EQC_NLR_introduce_new_currency_desc:0 "Though we've been tied to Equestria for many years, the currency slowly drifted longer and longer away from Equestria until the first New Marelander Bit was struck. As part of a demand and request from Canterlot, we will bring our currency in line with Equestria once more, but this time under the Lunar Empire, and their Imperial Bit."
 EQC_NLR_bat_equality:0 "Pass the Thestral Citizenship Act"
 EQC_NLR_bat_equality_desc:0 "There are three tribes, ponies have been taught. Not entirely correct. A fourth tribe, the thestrals have lived in the shadows of society, isolated from the rest of society. But they shall be pariahs no more. We will recognize them as true citizens of New Mareland, with all the rights and privileges associated forthwith. A nation that cannot take care of everyone is no nation at all."
 EQC_NLR_new_constitution:0 "Constitutional Rule"
 EQC_NLR_new_constitution_desc:0 "There is one law that stands above all else, even the requests from Canterlot. The Constitution of New Mareland. It is unquestionably the supreme law of the land, and nothing shall be able to circumvent or be repugnant to it. Even if lights go out all across the world and equine rights become nothing but a whisper elsewhere, we will stay strong as a nation of laws and a nation on solid ground."
 EQC_NLR_infrastrucutre_improvements:0 "Inter-Mareland Highway System"
 EQC_NLR_infrastrucutre_improvements_desc:0 "A newfangled invention has won widespread support in and around New Mareland. The highway. With an industry able to take up the new economy and help revive the cities, the Inter-Mareland Highway System will be the envy of the world. For a continent where carts and carriages can still be found in several places, we will look like a scene from the future."
 EQC_NLR_parks:0 "Parks And Recreation Act"
 EQC_NLR_parks_desc:0 "Strength through Joy.\nA staple of many slogans in the world, but for us, it needs to be more than a slogan. We need places where the ponies can go on holiday, or just out for a weekend when the urban life gets too much and they need a small sanctuary outside of the cities. Swathes of forest and prime lakefront will be protected for now and for the future."
 EQC_NLR_independence_negotiations:0 "Independence Negotiations"
 EQC_NLR_independence_negotiations_desc:0 "Though we are bound as one to Equestria and to the Lunar Empire, there are quite simply many expenses in keeping up with a colony or nation an ocean away from the metropole. Both sides of the Celestial Ocean have recognized this with an increasing number of ponies being aware of this with every passing day. In this, we will go to Canterlot and work out an arrangement that works for us all."
 EQC_NLR_protect_the_nation:0 "Protect the Nation"
 EQC_NLR_protect_the_nation_desc:0 "We may have no interest in interfering with Griffonian politics, but we also cannot ignore the threat of a possible invasion either. A defensive line along our borders must be constructed, to keep our nation and our way of life safe from anything that may threaten it. Should war come to our homeland, New Mareland will endure."
 EQC_NLR_regulated_shadowbolts:0 "A Friendlier Shadowbolt Society"
 EQC_NLR_regulated_shadowbolts_desc:0 "There are many reasons why ponies don't really like the Shadowbolts. Their secrecy, all the stories that the rumour mill is peddling for each day that goes by about some arcane, bestialic ritual. This cannot stand and way become something worse. We need to open up the Shadowbolts for the camera, and, if nothing else, at least give the impression that it is nothing but a club for ponies with too much time."
 EQC_NLR_shadowbolt_investment:0 "Friends In Dark Places"
 EQC_NLR_shadowbolt_investment_desc:0 "And yet, the Shadowbolts are also very useful for things the government cannot be seen openly doing. As a private society, whatever the Shadowbolts get up to is not officially our business unless it is illegal. If they happen to make choice investments that the government would not normally be able to, well, that's their problem and not ours. So what if it just so happens to benefit us both?"
 EQC_NLR_new_oil_projects:0 "The Empire's Oilwell"
 EQC_NLR_new_oil_projects_desc:0 "Below several lands in New Mareland lies great oil reserves, undisturbed ever since they were discovered some years ago. With the recent focus on autarky from the Empress, it is time that those same oil reserves were put to good use. For though the Ponyville Plain is the breadbasket, we will deliver the liquid that keeps the modern civilization running smoothly."
 EQC_NLR_shadowbolts_focus:0 "The Shadowbolt Society"
 EQC_NLR_shadowbolts_focus_desc:0 "Legend says the Shadowbolt Society was founded a thousand years ago by the original Shadowbolts who served Nightmare Moon. Others say the name is pure coincidence. What is true, however, is that the many of the most influential ponies in New Mareland are members of this Society and they have no qualms with assisting Nightmare Moon if it means keeping their heads."
 EQC_NLR_the_new_shadowbolts:0 "The New Society"
 EQC_NLR_the_new_shadowbolts_desc:0 "We shall not be the Shadowbolts of old. The times, they are changing and the world with it. We must adapt to changing circumstances and make sure that we do not fall behind the wagon, lest we become a relic of the past like so many other societies before us. We must, in the words of another pony, adapt or die."
 EQC_NLR_the_old_shadowbolts:0 "A Return To Our Roots"
 EQC_NLR_the_old_shadowbolts_desc:0 "The Winds of Change are blowing across New Mareland.\nAnd they are, in the wider sense, irrelevant. The largess and glamour of changing does not compare to the old ways which has served us so well over these past many, many years. When the winds blow, we stand fast on our place, in the face of adversity from inside or outside."
 EQC_NLR_industrial_security_act:0 "The Industrial Security Act"
 EQC_NLR_industrial_security_act_desc:0 "Around New Mareland, many companies are teetering on the brink of collapse, unable to find enough contracts or customers to keep the lights on ever since Black Wednesday. What seemed like a lost year has now turned into a lost decade. But there seems to be hope. If we can support and secure our industry and make sure that those that fail do not drag the rest down, we might make it out of this alive."
 EQC_NLR_implement_corporatism:0 "Shadowbolt Capitalism"
 EQC_NLR_implement_corporatism_desc:0 "The business interests in New Mareland have a lot of things in common with us. Large wealth, a desire to operate almost free of constraints and a good understanding of our place in the world. And yet, nopony has been reaching out between the two to set up a more permanent relationship. One that may turn out, if implemented to be very fruitful for both parties to engage in."
 EQC_NLR_use_the_cinema:0 "The Birth Of Mareland"
 EQC_NLR_use_the_cinema_desc:0 "There are many newfangled ways of getting a message out to the masses and none has proven more effective than the motion pictures. The ways that we can massage public opinion for, or against an ideal or purpose is a wonderful new perk that has been unavailable until now. And with the many internal issues still plaguing our country, one of the interns has had a very good idea lately."
 EQC_NLR_an_industrial_education:0 "Industrial Education"
 EQC_NLR_an_industrial_education_desc:0 "We must make sure that there is a strong base of knowledge to work from in New Mareland to ensure a new future for the nation. What is needed is not just the old science base, or the industrial sector that we have currently, but one that can go on to the future, one that can compete in the future. An industrial future, one of highly-educated workers that can turn out machines of today and tomorrow."
 EQC_NLR_family_programs:0 "Encourage Family Programs"
 EQC_NLR_family_programs_desc:0 "If there is one unit from which everything springs, it is the family. It is the family that operates as the base and core unit in the world and one that should be protected and empowered. And encouraging the individual families to set up their own programmes and their own small shops might just be the thing we are looking for."
 EQC_NLR_corporate_militarism:0 "Corporate Militarism"
 EQC_NLR_corporate_militarism_desc:0 "One thing that New Mareland has always had is heavy and secondary industry. Steel, aluminium, planes and cars. Though they are primarily used by civilians, they also have a dual purpose. War. The planes and cars that carry ponies and cargo can also carry bombs and grenades. We need to make the companies aware of this, and note that a small amount of contracts might be their way if they comply."
 EQC_NLR_economic_shocktherapy:0 "Economic Shock Therapy"
 EQC_NLR_economic_shocktherapy_desc:0 "There are several parts of the economy which are running at an, at best, sluggish pace. This is not just in one sector, but spread across multiple sectors. But in this environment we can't afford to have an economy at half speed. We must, at its base apply rapid loosening of restrictions and let the economy breathe free once more."
 EQC_NLR_grant_bats_equality:0 "Embrace the Thestrals"
 EQC_NLR_grant_bats_equality_desc:0 "When the War raged, there was one tribe that was loyal almost to a pony to the Night. The thestrals worked in tandem with the Empress during the war and were rewarded for it across the Ocean. But not here. This is a grave injustice that must be fixed. At the very least, the thestrals can be granted full equality with other ponies in New Mareland."
 EQC_NLR_convinct_leasing:0 "Convict Leasing"
 EQC_NLR_convinct_leasing_desc:0 "There is a dire lack of a skilled workforce in the nation, and even less cash to go around thanks to the war as of late. Fortunately, there is a very large population of 'willing' workers ready to work throughout the day without any sense of such things as 'unions' or 'higher wages'. The prisoners of New Mareland will finally have a way to repay their debt to society."
 EQC_NLR_local_shadowbolt_lodges:0 "The Fourth Branch Of the Government"
 EQC_NLR_local_shadowbolt_lodges_desc:0 "Schoolfoals are taught that we have a legislative, executive and judicial branch of government. Three in one. But what happens when they end up in a fight? What happens when they cannot agree? This is where the Shadowbolts come in. As the arbiter of their members, to which almost all ponies of note belong, they are in a unique position to mediate between squabbling branches whenever necessary."
 EQC_NLR_put_the_griffons_in_their_place:0 "Pass the Alien And Sedition Act"
 EQC_NLR_put_the_griffons_in_their_place_desc:0 "Though our rule seems safe, there are enemies all around us. Aliens going around the nation, plotting the very destruction of New Mareland. They live among us, never once showing their true allegiance until they decide to strike. We must strike first instead, and make sure that they will not be able to carry out their plans."
 EQC_NLR_the_elders:0 "Protocols Of the Elders Of Griffonstone"
 EQC_NLR_the_elders_desc:0 "There are many books that tell of the griffons beyond our borders. And one of the newer ones is one from an unknown author, talking about a plan that the griffons have laid in secret to dominate not just Griffonia, involving us and the Riverponies, but indeed the whole world. If we do not stay on watch, then there may well be a fifth column within our land that must be rooted out."
 EQC_NLR_extend_membership:0 "Expand the Shadowbolt Society"
 EQC_NLR_extend_membership_desc:0 "The Shadowbolts in their current form have served us well, but as their influence grows, so does the need for more members that can take care of the many, many, machinations they have going. We need to take charge and push for a greater membership to make sure that the membership fits the purpose."
 EQC_NLR_united_shadow_works:0 "United Shadow Works"
 EQC_NLR_united_shadow_works_desc:0 "Many of New Mareland's largest corporations are run by members of the Shadowbolt Society. Now that the Society is overseeing the nation, these assets can be safely nationalised into one single Shadowbolt corporation. After all, nothing will really change."
 EQC_NLR_status_of_the_society:0 "Status of the Society"
 EQC_NLR_status_of_the_society_desc:0 "The Shadowbolt Society was originally created with the intention to serve Nightmare Moon as her loyal subjects, and nothing more. Yet, with new territory on Griffonia coming under Lunar dominion, it is clear that we may have to play a larger role than originally intended. To that end, the Empress has seen fit to grant us more autonomy, so that we may better handle affairs on the continent."
 EQC_NLR_embrace_the_night:0 "Embrace the Night"
 EQC_NLR_embrace_the_night_desc:0 "No one in New Mareland was willing or was able to take the job as Governor-General of the place. It is necessary to send a pony who has the guts and has the necessary skills required to pacify this little place so that it may become a loyal province of the Empire.\nEvening Dew."
 EQC_NLR_coopt_the_shadowbolts:0 "Radicalise the Shadowbolt Society"
 EQC_NLR_coopt_the_shadowbolts_desc:0 "The Shadowbolts are a good place to start off with. They are already loyal to us, and have a core of dedicated members that we can work with to expand it. But they are lacking in...dedication to the Empress. Not to worry. We will make sure that they see the proper way of the Empress so that they can serve in the best way possible."
 EQC_NLR_scientific_modernisation:0 "Eliminate Scientific Boundaries"
 EQC_NLR_scientific_modernisation_desc:0 "The dogmatic ideas of what can and cannot be done in the name of science needs to be done away with. We are standing on the edge of several breakthroughs that can propel us more than a decade into the future. We should not be burdened with such things as 'morality' to stop us from enjoying those fruits of our labour."
 EQC_NLR_immediate_equality:0 "Thestral Equality Edict"
 EQC_NLR_immediate_equality_desc:0 "The Empress doth decree her wishes from time to time, and this time is no different. She has handed down a decree stating her will and pleasure is to have the Thestrals integrated with the rest of New Mareland with all necessary and deliberate speed so that they may continue to enjoy their lives, now out of the shadows and into the glorious moonlight that radiates out over the world."
 EQC_NLR_imperial_donation:0 "An Imperial Donation"
 EQC_NLR_imperial_donation_desc:0 "Her Empress and Lunar Majesty, Nightmare Moon has graciously decided to help out our ailing economy with a large cash injection to the most vulnerable places in the economy, with the hope of revitalization. We send out thanks to the Empress, and our humble gratitudes for her donation to New Mareland."
 EQC_NLR_national_rebirth:0 "One Nation Under the Nightmare"
 EQC_NLR_national_rebirth_desc:0 "The ponies of New Mareland now live under the watchful eye of the Empress, where they can sleep and live, happily knowing that the Nightmare will make sure that they do not suffer the indignity of a visit from Celestia loyalists or the griffon coming for a visit. They will now all know that the Nightmare protect."
 EQC_NLR_the_wickedness_of_griffonkind:0 "The Wickedness Of Griffonkind"
 EQC_NLR_the_wickedness_of_griffonkind_desc:0 "There is a scourge beyond our borders. The Griffons. In their incursions against the Riverponies, they have torn them limb from limb, forced them into slavery and worse. The griffons are, in all their creature, the natural enemies of all equinity. It needs to be the duty of everypony in New Mareland, as the final outpost on Griffonia to be on watch for the Griffon threat."
 EQC_NLR_the_nightmares_eyes:0 "The Eyes Of the Nightmare"
 EQC_NLR_the_nightmares_eyes_desc:0 "We are no longer some backwater colony of Equestria, so far away to be forgotten about in daily speech.\nWe are New Mareland, the first and final bastion of the Nightmare on Griffonia. We stand as a proud vanguard of the Empress, defending the Night until our very end of our life."
 EQC_NLR_coopt_the_segregationists:0 "The Picket-Dew Pact"
 EQC_NLR_coopt_the_segregationists_desc:0 "Picket Fence and Evening Dew. Two ponies who shouldn't have things in common. One who has fierce loyalty to the Night, another who stood for patriation. And there is yet still things that unite them. Hatred of griffons.\nTogether they have formulated a plan to give Picket a blank check on his plans. As long as Evening Dew knows."
 EQC_NLR_work_camps_for_griffons:0 "Redemptionary Camps"
 EQC_NLR_work_camps_for_griffons_desc:0 "Though the griffons may be loathsome creatures, who have no right to live in New Mareland, they are still creatures with a brain and two limbs who can work for the betterment of society. Their crimes against the state will be worked off in Redemption Camps located in remote regions where we can securely monitor them for any subversive activities."
 EQC_NLR_national_tithe:0 "The National Tithe"
 EQC_NLR_national_tithe_desc:0 "There is to be a complete overhaul of the taxes. The tax code, long an unwieldy and unreasonably long one needs to be slimmed down. Very slimmed down. The taxes will be replaced by tithes on every step of income that is earned. While this will cost us a bit, the economy getting back up into gear will be more than worth it."
 EQC_NLR_expel_the_savages:0 "Expel the Savages"
 EQC_NLR_expel_the_savages_desc:0 "We can now take the final step towards the solution to the Griffon problem. We have no use for them anywhere in our fair community and we do not intend to find a use for them. They will not be shown any deference, but an open door and a firm demand to get out of the nation to their kin in Aquilea and Wingbardy."
 EQC_NLR_soldiers_of_the_night:0 "Soldiers Of the Night"
 EQC_NLR_soldiers_of_the_night_desc:0 "We are the Soldiers of the Night. The Vanguard of the Nightmare and the First to Fight. We stand against all enemies of the Empress, griffons, ponies or anyone else. Let the enemies rue this day that we rose from New Mareland's hard soil to challenge those that seek to destroy us."
 EQC_NLR_the_prophet:0 "The Prophet"
 EQC_NLR_the_prophet_desc:0 "Evening Dew has served the Empress well. Very well indeed during his appointment as Governor-General of New Mareland. There has even been talk in the wings of the palace and in the capital that there might be another thing in the works for him.\nA new title, one that will signify his place as an extension of the will of the Empress maybe. Maybe it is just talk, but an envoy has been rumoured to be underway."
 EQC_NLR_spread_the_darkness:0 "Spread the Darkness"
 EQC_NLR_spread_the_darkness_desc:0 "Just beyond our borders lies the ancestral enemy of the ponies, the griffons. Their 'Kingdom' in Wingbardy has grown fat off the sweat of ponies and has as its goal the subsumation of New Mareland into itself, to the horror and shock of everypony. We must strike first before they can gather and spread the Nightmare all the way out into Griffonia, to Karthin and beyond."
 EQC_NLR_united_lunar_territories_of_griffonia:0 "The United Lunar Territories of Griffonia"
 EQC_NLR_united_lunar_territories_of_griffonia_desc:0 "We are taking the first steps towards an entirely new domain of the Empress, far from her rule and from the capital. And while She may not be able to exert her will here, we are able to fill her place as an extension of her authority. The United Lunar Territories of Griffonia is the culmination of that extension, acting as the newest frontier of the lands of Her Imperial Majesty."

 EQC_NLR.1.t:0 "The Sunset Question"
 EQC_NLR.1.d:0 "We have secured the country at large and the time has come to wipe our territory clean of any vile Celestial titles. Where better to start with than our capital of course! Shall the capital's administration make ready to re-title itself to the proud city of Midnight?"

 EQC_NLR.1.b:0 "Keeping the old name is a permanent reminder of our victory."
 
 EQC_NLR.2.t:0 "Refugees Arrive To New Mareland"
 EQC_NLR.2.d:0 "The ship lies heavy in the water as it steams into the harbor of [Root.Capital.GetName]. Marked by bullets ricocheting off it and the occasional act of vandalism in its paint, the M/S Sea Spray has seen better days before the War. And yet, she is on her most important mission. In her are more than 1,500 ponies. Refugees from the War, young and old, unicorn, earth pony and pegasi. All are they seeking a new life away from the devastation and ruin that Equestria has been left in.\n\nThe ship docks. One by one, they are disembarking the ship, carrying their possession in old and worn bags or sacks. Each bears the marks of a war injury, either on their body or their psyche, looking out at the city before them.\n\nAnd yet, there is a new expression on their face. Hope. They have with them the hope of a new era in their life, one free of need in a new place. And that's what New Mareland can provide. A land of opportunity where everyone can rise above their old station to make for themselves success and fortune for themselves and their family. And they will for themselves give back to New Mareland, forming a virtuous cycle."
 EQC_NLR.2.a:0 "Welcome!"
 
 EQC_NLR.3.t:0 "The Direction of our Society"
 EQC_NLR.3.d:0 ""Oh, enough with the fanaticism already!" Sunny Flare slammed her hooves on the long rectangular table, standing on her hind legs. "We've handled things just fine here without listening to your talk about "praising the Empress" and we don't need to change that!"\n\nThe Shadowbolt opposite from her folded his hooves. "That sounds like heretical talk to me," he warned, leaning forward. "Do not forget who's mercy allowed us to take charge in the first place, Miss Flare."\n\nSour Sweet watched the arguments continue to unfold from her place at the head of the table. To her left where the new guard, the rich and influential ponies like Lemon Zest and Indigo Zap, who she had made personal friends with while collaborating on her... earlier business schemes. To her right were the old guard, the true Lunarists among the Shadowbolts which even included a few thestrals, who were descended from the very first society long ago. Not Sour's personal favorites, but there were still highly respected in the society and their opinions held a lot of weight. And right now, the Shadowbolts were very split down the middle.\n\n"This Society was formed to serve the Empress when she returned, not for you to make money!" a thestral of the old guard exclaimed, pointing a hoof at Sunny Flare. "The mere idea of using her blessing for personal profit is absurd!"\n\n"Praising the moon isn't what kept the society alive to the modern era either," Sugarcoat replied bluntly, looking bored through her glasses.\n\nThe arguing only continued to get louder and louder until Sour Sweet couldn't take it anymore. "Quiet!" she yelled, and the table immediately fell silent. "I am tired of you all acting like petty foals! We are going to sit down and solve this like adults!"\n\nThe Shadowbolts all looked at each other before turning to Sour again. "How about you decide then, Chairpony? What outlook should our society take?"\n\nSour Sweet took a deep breath before first looking at her friends, and then the hardline Lunarists. "It's quite obvious. The Shadowbolt Society...""
 EQC_NLR.3.a:0 ""...does not need to change. We will rule as we always have.""
 EQC_NLR.3.b:0 ""...are Lunarists first and foremost. Serving the Empress is our primary goal.""
 
 EQC_NLR.4.t:0 "A Friendlier Shadowbolt Society"
 EQC_NLR.4.d:0 "Sour Sweet adjusted her bowtie and fixed her collar one last time as she looked at the three colleagues surrounding her. "I look fine, right?" she asked all of them. "Nothing out of place? Is my ponytail crooked?"\n\n"Sour, you look fine," Sunny Flare answered, putting a hoof on her shoulder. "Besides, it's just one journalist coming for a visit!"\n\n"It is not just one journalist! This is the first time we've opened up to the public in decades! If we're going to dispel all the rumors about us going around recently, we have to get this right!"\n\nSugarcoat looked up at Sour. "Well snapping like that is definitely not going to help us look better."\n\nShe just rolled her eyes in response before taking a deep breath. After counting to three, she looked at each of her friends; Sunny, Sugarcoat and Lemon Zest in that order. "Remember, don't mention anything about your normal schemes. We can talk regular business, or whatever, but lay off the secrecy."\n\nThey all nodded right as the door opened and a sharply dressed unicorn walked into the room. Sour Sweet moved to greet her. "Hi! I'm Sour Sweet, and welcome to the Shadowbolt Society! We're sure you'll have a great time here attending one of our monthly meetings. Here, have a seat...""
 EQC_NLR.4.a:0 "See! They're not evil!"
 
 EQC_NLR.5.t:0 "The Birth Of Mareland"
 EQC_NLR.5.d:0 ""What do I look like, a screenwriter?!" Sour Sweet forcibly handed the papers in her hoof back to the intern. "Ask somepony who knows about the script, not me!"\n\nAs the intern scurried away, Sour saw Sugarcoat raise an eyebrow. But it wasn't at her. Turning, she saw a few more Shadowbolts approaching, the old guard. Internally sighing, she moved to greet them.\n\n"So, what can I do for you gentleponies today?" she asked, trying to keep things as professional as possible. The sooner these ponies were out of her mane, the better.\n\nThe other Shadowbolts looked at each other. "Well, Chairpony, we have heard of your idea for this new "movie", and we believe that it is an excellent idea. However, looking at the script, it could use a few... alterations."\n\nGreat. Absolutely wonderful. If Sour could have done so professionally, she would have facehoofed. "What kind of alterations?"\n\n"Oh, just a few things here and there. After all, we need to make sure the populace is informed of the threat the griffons pose to our society as a whole, yes?"\n\nBoth Sour Sweet and Sugarcoat blinked. The latter spoke first. "So you want us to take a film meant for showcasing our rule in a positive light and turn it into anti-griffon propaganda. That is going to do absolutely nothing for us. We are trying to show ponies that things are safe, not dangerous."\n\nThey all scoffed at that. "You think that the griffons will just let us remain here for free? They will come eventually to destroy us, and if everypony does not know that beforehoof then they will succeed. This is no time for games, Miss Sugarcoat."\n\nThe two devolved into another argument as Sour just watched from the sidelines. As Chairpony and technical producer, she did have complete control over what outlook the movie would take. And while she agreed with Sugarcoat, that wasn't to say that the old Shadowbolts didn't have a point on the threat the griffons might pose..."
 EQC_NLR.5.a:0 "We need to calm the ponies, not rile them up further."
 EQC_NLR.5.b:0 "Warn them all of the avian menace, while we still have the chance!"
 
 EQC_NLR.6.t:0 "The Protocols Of The Elders of Griffonstone"
 EQC_NLR.6.d:0 "PROTOCOL NO.1\n\nRIGHT IN MIGHT, FREEDOM IN IDEA ONLY\n\nWhat we are about to set forth, is that our system, from two points of views. That of ourselves, and that of the dweebs. It must be noted that the ponies with bad instincts, those that seek to destroy us are greater in number than the good, and that therefore, we obtain the best results in governing them through the principles of violence and destruction. Every creature aims at power, and everyone would like to become a dictator with supreme power if they could. Rare indeed are those that sacrifice their own welfare for others welfare.\n\nRarer still are those who do not cow when threatened with violence or death.\n\nFor equality of the creatures is an idea, but it is not a fact. The idea, one must know how to apply whenever it appears necessary with this bait to attract the unwashed, low-information masses.\n\nThis is rendered easier, if the opponent in question is already tainted with the idea of "Equal Protection" and for the sake of that idea, is willing to yield some of their power. It is precisely here that the triumph of our theory appears. The slackened reins of a government are immediately, by the law of life, picked up and gathered by a new, firm claw."
 EQC_NLR.6.a:0 "All of Ponykind will finally see the truth!"
 
 EQC_NLR.7.t:0 "In With The Old"
 EQC_NLR.7.d:0 "As the new recruits stood before the altar in the Temple, each wearing the brooch of a new initiate in the Shadowbolts, Sour Sweet watched from a dark corner in the room.\n\nThe Grandmaster, the direct descendant of the original founder of the Shadowbolt Society, came down from the stairs leading up to the sanctums. A unicorn, dressed in an ornate robe, with gold and silver filigrees running along the deep blue fabric. A ceremonial sword, in blueish metal with a massive sapphire in the middle hung by his side as he made his way over towards the recruits. Sour watched as the members gathered around them began chanting, the recruits one by one kneeling before the Grandmaster.\n\nThey began reciting the oath as the sword lightly touched them in order, held up by the grandmaster's magic. "I solemnly swear, that I will follow the Empress of the Night wherever she commands. Through the depth of Tartarus and to the icy North. I swear that I will not reveal the secrets of the Shadowbolt Society, even on pain of Tartarus itself. I will not break my oath, even if I must go to the grave and to eternal damnation for keeping it."\n\nAs they rose, Sour rolled her eyes. It was all too official, too traditional for her tastes. She felt like they were sliding back in time, back to a dark age of religious fevor over reasoned thought. But in the end, it wasn't her call to make.\n\nShe had lost control over her own society. The Shadowbolts she and her friends had known was gone, replaced only with ponies loyal to the Empress and the Nightmare alone."
 EQC_NLR.7.a:0 "The Shadowbolts are the Nightmare's spearhead!"
 
 EQC_NLR.8.t:0 "The Fourth Branch of Government"
 EQC_NLR.8.d:0 ""This has gone too far this time!" Strong Word said as he put a hoof on the glass table. "You and the judicial system have done nothing but try and interfere in our legislative process, advancing your own agenda. Well, we've had enough of it!"\n\n"Us?" Tight Scale scoffed. "You are the ones always involving yourselves in our justice system! We are only trying to protect the independence of our branch of the government that you are trying to steal!"\n\n"And you are not trying to steal ours? Please, all you care about is getting power for yourself. New Mareland's democratic system will not be torn apart from you and your friends' power fantasies!"\n\n"Both of you are wrong."\n\nThe two ponies looked across the room to see a third enter, impeccably dressed in her Shadowbolt uniform and glasses. "M-miss Sugarcoat," Word stammered, "we didn't notice you come in. How much did you hear?"\n\n"Everything." She walked over to where the two were sitting, staring them both down. "If you were actually trying to control each other, the Shadowbolts would have known a long time ago. All you two do instead is argue like foals. If you want to have it settled, you can always come to us to meditate your disagreement." Her stare hardened. "Do you want us to do that?"\n\nBoth of them looked at each other. "No no, Miss Sugarcoat, that's fine," Tight Scale answered, sweat starting to form. "It was just a minor argument like you said, that's all."\n\nSilence. "Good," she finally responded. Then, without another word, she walked away, hooves tapping on the hard floor. Only when the door closed behind her did the two politicans breathe a sigh of relief."
 EQC_NLR.8.a:0 "Any arguments will be settled by us... our way."
 
 EQC_NLR.9.t:0 "The Picket-Dew Line"
 EQC_NLR.9.d:0 "The posters appeared one by one in the cities, and in the countryside soon after. Some depict scenes of graphic violence: a dead pony in the claws of a griffon, or a griffon knight slashing through a pony soldier. Others depict insatiable greed: griffon gangsters committing armed robbery, or a fat merchant from Skyfall swindling honest ponies.\n\nThey all share one element in common, other than being anti-griffon. At the bottom of each poster is a slogan, usually something like "STOP THE GRIFFON MENACE" or "BOYCOTT GRIFFON-MADE PRODUCTS." Beside each slogan are the signatures of Picket Fence, Governor of New Hoofington, and Evening Dew, the Governor-General. No matter whose idea they were, the posters seem to be hitting the right cords.\n\nPonies across New Mareland are holding demonstrations in support of the campaign and the new laws targeting griffon communitites. In rural areas, griffons must now present a pass to travel between towns, and many municipalities plan to bar griffons from becoming permanent residents. In the cities, major pressure has been put on factory owners to fire their griffon workers and hire ponies instead. Restaurants that cater to griffon customers have been the targets of boycotts and, occasionally, violent attacks.\n\nMany were surprised to learn that Picket Fence, who was previously a member of the New Mareland Republican Fascist Party, is working with Evening Dew, a devout Lunarist. When asked for comment, Governor Fence stated that his beliefs have not changed, but he is happy to work with the Governor-General to "solve the griffon problem.""
 EQC_NLR.9.a:0 "For an Equine New Mareland!"
 
 EQC_NLR.10.t:0 "The Radio Broadcast"
 EQC_NLR.10.d:0 "Evening Dew cleared his throat as he approached the microphone. He wore a smug smile, confident in the truth of what he was about to say.\n\n"Ponies of New Mareland! We are, at this momment, facing a serious crisis. Beyond our borders, beyond the last vestiges of equine civilization lies an existential threat. The griffons present themselves to the world as a collection of independent, sovereign nations. They claim that, through hard work and honest means, they will rise to become the envy of both pony and zebra.\n\nBut we know the truth. Just as a snake cannot defy its instincts, the griffon cannot leave behind its insidious nature. They are depraved, barbaric creatures. Treachery and murder come naturally to them, as they are inherently violent. They feast on the corpses of their enemies, tearing them apart without a care for morality.\n\nSome insist on calling griffons our fellow creatures, but I prefer to call them what they really are: demons, demons from the depths of Tartarus itself!\n\nContrast them with us, the equines. We are a physically weaker species, but we have the aegis of the Empress to protect us. And we do not fear adversity. When the griffons failed to tame the hard soil of New Mareland, we rose to the challenge. Now we must rise to defend ourselves, our land, and our faith!\n\nWe may be small, and we may be few, but we are stronger together, and we serve an Empress who will lead us towards a better future. As Her Imperial Majesty's representative, it is my duty to lead you on her behalf.\n\nAnd we will need strong leadership. Though the griffons are presently fighting amongst themselves, they will not stay amongst themselves forever. When they turn outwards these griffons, these demons from Tartarus will come here!\n\nWe must be ready for them. We need to prepare ourselves for their attack. When they come, we will meet them with all the might and power of Equinity and save our land!""
 EQC_NLR.10.a:0 "We must defeat these demons!"
 
 EQC_NLR.11.t:0 "The End of New Mareland?"
 EQC_NLR.11.d:0 "Now that the old administration has been removed and a new one loyal to the Empress has taken its place, there have been controversial rumors floating around about a new proposal concerning the country. All ponies know of the thestral's status as the favored tribe of the moon, and the one which supports Her Majesty the most in her rule of the Lunar Empire. To reflect that status, some wish for the country to officially rename itself to Thestralia, a home for all batponies. While not very popular with our non-batpony citizens, it would certainly endear us to the thestrals living here and perhaps draw more from the mainland. Though of course, the old name of New Mareland has been with us for centuries. What shall it be?"
 EQC_NLR.11.a:0 "G'day mate! Welcome to Thestralia! Business or pleasure?"
 EQC_NLR.11.b:0 "We will stick with our heritage, and remain New Mareland."
 
 EQC_NLR.12.t:0 "New Blood"
 EQC_NLR.12.d:0 ""The last time we met like this, I believe you told me that if I declined your offer to join, I would not get another chance," Jet Set commented as he raised an eyebrow at Sour Sweet across the table.\n\nSour was tempted to stomp the floor in frustration but restrained herself, instead forcing a smile at both Jet Set and Upper Crust. "Yes, I do remember saying that. However, considering how important you still are to the ponies of New Mareland, I decided to make an exception."\n\nUpper Crust scoffed at that. "Hmph. If I had it my way, we never would have come to this meeting in the first place. Our loyalties remain with Harmony, no matter what."\n\n"Personally, I don't care where your loyalties lie in our society," Sour replied. "What I care about is what you can offer the Society, and what the Society can offer you."\n\n"...Continue."\n\nSour Sweet leaned in towards Jet Set, crossing her hooves on the table. "Ponies know you, Jet Set. And more importantly, they trust you. Your successful business sense would have already made you a candidate for induction, but those two things together? You would make a valuable addition to our little group. And as for us..." She gestured to the room around them. "Our resources would be at your disposal. You help us, we help you. So, what do you say?" She outstretched her hoof towards him. "Will you accept our invitation?"\n\nJet Set and Upper Crust looked at each other for a moment before facing back and nodding once. Then, after shaking hooves once, Sour Sweet gave them their Shadowbolts pins as the newest members of the Society."
 EQC_NLR.12.a:0 "Welcome to the club!"
 
 EQC_NLR.13.t:0 "Small Business"
 EQC_NLR.13.d:0 "Soft Spot put the broom back in the closet and closed the door before letting out a content sigh and sitting on a nearby chair. Only months ago had the idea of her starting her own business seemed absurd, what with her being a family mare and her husband paying the bills working at the nearby steelworks. And yet, here she was, running her own little pastry shop in downtown New Manehattan. It was even running fairly successfully; she was turning a nice profit from all the new government subsidies and bonuses, which was what had gotten her to give her idea a shot in the first place...\n\nThe bell by the door rang, and Soft Spot looked up, only to have her jaw drop to the floor. Trotting in was none other than one of the most popular ponies in all of New Mareland, Lemon Zest. She looked around the shop in her dress uniform, the Shadowbolts Society pin clear on her collar. "Anypony here?" she asked out loud.\n\nSoft practically tripped over herself rushing to the counter. "I'm here, I'm here!" she said hurriedly. "What can I get you, Miss Zest?"\n\nThe Shadowbolt waved a hoof. "Call me Lemon. I'll need a dozen cupcakes for the upcoming Society meeting. I was supposed to bring the food this time, and I totally forgot until right now!"\n\n"Of course, Mis- I mean Lemon." Composing herself, Soft Spot walked to where she kept the day's pastries, looking for the best kind of cupcakes to give her. "It's really an honor to meet you," she said as she pulled out a packaged dozen cupcakes and brought them over to the register. "I mean, I really should be thanking you and all, with how your new small business bonuses helped me open this place."\n\n"I know, it's crazy right? Never would have guessed that Sour and Sunny of all ponies would have thought of something like that up. They had some long economic talk on why it was good and all but I totally slept through the whole thing."\n\nAfter putting some bits on the counter, Lemon grabbed the cupcakes with a hoof and started trotting out the door. "Thanks, you're a lifesaver!"\n\n"You're welcome," Soft Spot replied as the mare walked back into the open streets of New Manehattan. She sighed again. Perhaps the Shadowbolts weren't as bad as she first thought."
 EQC_NLR.13.a:0 "It's a win for everypony!"
 
 EQC_NLR.14.t:0 "United Shadow Works"
 EQC_NLR.14.d:0 ""Just because your corporation was the largest when we formed the USW doesn't mean that you get to tell us what to do!"\n\nSour Sweet gave a huff while she rolled her eyes. Ever since the idea was proposed to merge all the Shadowbolt-controlled corporations into one entity, the United Shadow Works, it had been nothing but trouble for her. First she had to get all the Society members to agree to it, which was a pain in and of itself. Then had come the issue of who would manage what, where everypony involved had tried to get as much authority over the company as possible. Once a compromise had been reached on forming an executive Shadowbolt council to oversee the entity, it had seemed that everypony had left satisfied.\n\nThat is, until today's issue of funding had come up.\n\n"Oh yes, because your company was performing so much better than mine was," Sour replied in a saccharine tone. "If you're using failures as a statistic. I'm just trying to divide funding according to common sense, and if my part of the corporation is making the most profit, then it needs the most funding to maintain that!"\n\n"And who put you in charge of the funding in the first place, Sour?" The rest of the Shadowbolts present murmured their agreement with Sunny Flare as she crossed her hooves.\n\n"Yeah, just because you're the Chairpony doesn't mean you get to call all the shots!" another council member from the back said.\n\nAnd it was at that very moment that Sour Sweet was ready to bang her head against the table. This meeting was going to take a while."
 EQC_NLR.14.a:0 "Why can't we go back to how things used to be?"
 
 EQC_NLR.15.t:0 "The New Workforce"
 EQC_NLR.15.d:0 "When the motion was first passed by the Shadowbolts to start leasing convicts as labor, nothing seemed to change. In fact, things seemed to just go on as normal as the labor issue in the country was finally solved. Profits went up higher than ever before with lower required wages, the officially imprisoned population in New Mareland went down, and overall the program was relatively successful. Ever Sugarcoat, who had been against it originally couldn't argue with its results.\n\nYet behind closed doors, not everything was running smoothly. What had seemed like a simple new law from the outside had been heavily debated and fought from the inside, within the Society. Sour Sweet and Sunny Flare had been neutral, but the rest of their group had argued endlessly with the old Shadowbolts on convict labor. Lemon Zest had even walked out of the meeting, citing her public image and general feeling that this was the wrong thing for New Mareland to do. Sour had only seen her a few times since then, and she could tell the mare was still angry over what they had done.\n\nWas she right? Sour didn't know what to think of it herself. She had joined and led the Shadowbolt Society in the first place for simple reasons; to make money and have a stronger voice in New Mareland's politics. She had made friends too, sure, but her original intention had never changed. And on paper, using convicts was something towards that goal. She made more money alongside everypony else, and she was still the Chairpony of the Shadowbolts, even if those friends were having a few disagreements.\n\nSo, why did she feel that they were going too far with this?"
 EQC_NLR.15.a:0 "Who cares about the convicts anyway?"
 
 EQC_NLR.16.t:0 "A Meeting of Colleagues"
 EQC_NLR.16.d:0 "Officially, it was a party invite sent out to all members and branches of the Shadowbolt Society. Held in the most opulent palace in [Root.Capital.GetName], countless Shadowbolts mingled at the event, chatting and dancing the night away. Suri Polomare was showing off her latest dress design to a few ponies from the Falcor branch, and even Jet Set seemed to be enjoying himself speaking with old friends.\n\nHowever, as with many things in the Society, there was more to one purpose for this gathering. In a room far above the main event, five ponies had gathered in their own meeting overlooking the party. Lemon Zest had finally conceded to Sugarcoat for once and allowed classical music to be played on record in the background while the friends enjoyed their champagne.\n\n"You know," Sour Sweet said, "I remember back when all of us first joined the Shadowbolt Society. We all hated each other back then, right?"\n\n"Yeah, because Lemon Zest wouldn't take anything seriously," Sugarcoat responded.\n\nLemon spewed the champagne in her mouth, much to Sunny Flare's displeasure. "What?! It was because you were so serious all the time! All you ever did was tell me to pay attention to boring stuff, or that I was doing things wrong!"\n\n"Well, it seems some things never changed," Sunny commented, causing a round of laughter from the three girls watching the argument. Sugarcoat rolled her eyes and adjusted her glasses while Lemon glared.\n\nSour Sweet shut down the argument by clearing her throat loudly and walking between the two. "What I was trying to point out was how far we've come since then. We've gone from an underground society for manipulating economics to leaders of entire nations in the world. Everypony in this room has their own branch of the Shadowbolts."\n\nThe other four gathered on both sides of Sour Sweet, forming a semi-circle. "We couldn't have done it without you, Sour!" Lemon Zest said, her mood having clearly returned. "You've been the best leader and Chairpony we could ask for!"\n\n"You did do better than I thought you would," Sugarcoat agreed.\n\n"We're all lucky to have you," Sunny Flare added, putting a hoof on her shoulder.\n\n"And soon, I'm sure we'll be calling the shots on the whole planet!" Indigo Zap finished.\n\nSour Sweet looked at each of them one by one before her eyes turned to the window in front of them, looking down at all the Shadowbolt members below. "I may not know what the future holds for the Society," she remarked with a genuine smile forming on her face, "but I know that with you girls as my colleag- no, my friends, we can win at anything.""
 EQC_NLR.16.a:0 "A toast, to the success of the Shadowbolts and its Chairpony!"
 
 EQC_NLR.17.t:0 "A Meeting of Colleagues"
 EQC_NLR.17.d:0 "It was already past midnight when the last members of the Shadowbolt Society filed into the ballroom in a palace within [Root.Capital.GetName], classical music playing from a band on the stage. Members of all four tribes danced and made small talk as they sipped their wine, coming from all across the territories of Southern Griffonia to attend. It had all the parts of any formal ball, every guest impeccably dressed in the official uniform of the Shadowbolt Society and with the small pin on the collars.\n\nYet in a small room overlooking the dance, five ponies stood together, watching the scene unfold. The absolute silence further exacerbated the somber tone, each only staring at the glass window in front of them.\n\n"Shouldn't... you be down there, Sour?" Lemon Zest asked hesitantly. "I mean, you're the Chairpony and all."\n\nSour Sweet didn't even look at her as she responded. "Am I, Lemon? It doesn't feel like it anymore."\n\n"What do you mean?" Sunny Flare leaning forward to look at Sour's face with a confused expression. "Sour, the Shadowbolt Society has never been stronger under your leadership! You received a personal letter of commendation from the Empress herself! How could you think you're not our Chairpony?"\n\nThe pony refused to meet Sunny's eyes. "I never wanted to lead for any of that," she finally answered, keeping her eyes trained on the party below. "I wanted the power, I'll admit it. But there was something else, something that I think united all of us in the Society to become friends. But I haven't felt that thing for a long time now."\n\nThe other Shadowbolts looked at each other before they turned their attention to Sour Sweet again. Despite the absurdity of it, her words were true, for all of them. They had each joined the Society for a purpose, and each had enjoyed meeting and working with each other, back before the Nightmare's return. Now though, even with everything they had done... there was nothing left for them. No enjoyment, no fun.\n\nSour Sweet put a hoof on the window panel and stared at her reflection, looking right back at her. "We got what we wanted, didn't we? We served the Empress, we control all of southern Griffonia. We're some of the most influential mares in the world now. By every account, we won."\n\n"So... why doesn't it feel that way?""

He was their absolute ruler serving in the Empress's name, after all, so why wouldn't he have the title? Everything he did, he did for Her Imperial Majesty, and his words were the words of the Empress.\n\nHowever, the Lunar Empire's reaction was... less positive than we expected. What little support Evening Dew had left among the radical Lunarists has all but evaporated since the proclamation, which they consider a heresy of the highest order. Yesterday the Empress herself finally took a stance on the matter, calling Evening Dew's actions "treasonous." She has officially severed all ties with the colony to punish our insubordination.\n\nWhen Evening Dew heard the news, he locked himself in his room for 3 days straight, refusing to speak to anypony. After he finally emerged, he declared that Her Imperial Majesty is merely testing his faith and devotion, and said our exclusion from the Empire will end soon.\n\nMost New Marelanders aren't buying this story. Day by day, they are realizing how precarious our situation has become. We now find ourselves devoid of the Empress's protection, and vulnerable to griffon aggression.\n\nWe are alone."
 EQC_NLR.18.a:0 "What is a Prophet without his deity?"
 
 EQC_NLR.19.t:0 "Loyalty"
 EQC_NLR.19.d:0 ""I must admit, Governor-General, you have far exceeded my expectations in your tenure. It is not often that such a pony rises so far above his post, especially one so... lacking in devotion."\n\nJet Set dipped his head towards the Empress in respect. "Thank you, your Majesty. It is my honor to have served you with such success."\n\nNightmare Moon regally walked across the room to the window, where the capital of New Mareland spread out before the shining moonlight. "Be honest, Governor. What do you think of my rule?" Her slit eye traced the unicorn as he carefully chose his next words.\n\n"Your reign has brought nothing but prosperity to New Mareland," Jet Set said calmly. "Under your guidance, we have established control over all of Southern Griffonia, and the ponies in the nation have never-"\n\n"I am not speaking of your success, Governor." The alicorn turned to face him again. "I know you have contacts within the Empire. Celestial sympathizers, most likely. I want your personal opinion on my reign."\n\nNightmare Moon stared Jet Set down, but not once did he falter. He was too trained, too experienced for a mistake like that. His eyes did not once leave Hers as he spoke steadily.\n\n"When I was sent to New Mareland, I was loyal to one thing; the Princess. Then, I became loyal to New Mareland. Now, I am loyal to both it, and Equestria itself. And as long as the New Mareland people remain loyal to you, I shall as well."\n\nThe Nightmare did not speak for a few moments. Then, She turned away, slowly walking towards the open door. "I can see why my sister chose you." she said, not looking back. "The Empire and I thank you for your continued service, Governor-General. You may return to your duties."\n\nThe doors closed behind Nightmare Moon, leaving Jet Set alone."
 EQC_NLR.19.a:0 "'Keep Calm and Carry On', as we always have."
 
 EQC_NLR.20.t:0 "A Prophet Without Honor"
 EQC_NLR.20.d:0 "Nightmare Moon stood alone, smiling. A pleasant aura emanated from her figure. Evening Dew approached, shaking with every step.\n"You have done well, my prophet."\nEvening felt tears form in his eyes. It was all he ever want-\n"Goveror-General! Can you hear me?"\n\nThe gruff stallion's voice jolted Evening back to reality. He found himself seated at a wooden table. He and a few advisors were meeting with an old general. Evening stretched his wings and ran a hoof over his messy mane. He felt the bags under his bloodshot eyes. Frowning, he grabbed a pot of coffee and took a sip.\n"Yes, General, I can hear you! I ignored you because I was contemplating Her Imperial Majesty's will. Now please, say your piece, and remember to address me as Prophet of the Nightmare."\n\nThe general looked flustered. "Yes, Prophet. I asked you here to discuss our strategic situation. Griffon resistance to our rule is increasing. It's become a full-scale insurgency."\nEvening snarled "Vile Barbarians. Demons from Tartarus, all of them!"\n"Yes, well, be that as it may, our forces are spread very thin. Supplies are running low, and I fear our industry won't be able to keep up with demand. We can't trade with griffon states, and since the Empress disavowed you it's been hard to get shipments from Equus..."\n\nThe terror in the faces of Evening's advisors made the general realize he'd crossed a line. Evening's eye twitched, and then he smiled.\n"Disavowed, you say? Nonsense! Her Imperial Majesty has simply seen fit to test my faith. Any day now she will announce that I have passed and welcome me back into her fold. Any day now..."\n\nEvening's face contorted with frustration. He squeezed the coffee pot between his hooves, until suddenly it shattered. Screams erupted from his mouth as hot coffee splashed him.\n\nFor a moment everyone was silent. The only audible sound was blood dripping from the cuts on Evening's hooves.\n"Well General, your presentation was most enlightening. I think you will understand the situation better if you see it from a... different perspective. I'm demoting you to private and sending you into the field, effective immediately."\n\nThe old stallion shivered. "I don't think I'm suited for-"\n"Really Private, I insist!" Evening said, venom in his voice. With a wave, he signaled his guards to take the former general away."
