Do you not understand the severity of inaction?"\n\nThe Architect preceded many, but was still bound by familial bonds to answer The First's call. "I do. Patience will be rewarded with a Feast, my beloved."\n\nThe First scoffed at this. "Patience will only get us so far. Already many of the Lesser have succumbed, yet the Famine itself hasn't even arrived. The plan must be set in motion. Now."\n\n"Just a little while longer," reassured the Architect, "I have been grooming the Heir for most of its life. It will be the perfect Vessel to bring about the Feast. All that remains is for the Fool to be removed, and for the Heir to take its place."\n\n"Do not presume that you can put off my demands until later. Yet I see this plan of yours is not without merit. You have until the Heir's mortal coil is extinguished. If your plan is not enacted by that point, then I shall see that you suffer the same fate the Lesser."\n\nThe First departed, leaving the Architect alone to watch over the night once more.

dread_start.20.t:0 "The Latest Expedition"
dread_start.20.d:0 "Among the Library of Magehold's myriad of oddities, its non-euclidean, ever-changing layout was perhaps its most interesting feature. Every so often, official expeditions would be organized by the Magisterium to search for new secrets and wonders to extract from the seemingly limitless wealth of magical knowledge held beneath their hooves.\n\nAt the main entrance of the Library sat an ancient lich by the name of Vetus Maledictus. Being the original Librarian of this place, he had visited the depths of that labyrinth on countless occasions, though he seldom went in anymore due to his declining mental health. Nowadays he spent his time looking through and cataloguing the new findings by more adventurous mages.\n\nAs the latest group to exit the Library passed off some spellbooks and artifacts to Vetus, he reflected on his last journey down there. Eighty years ago, was it? And he'd gotten lost for so long that the search party numbered in the thousands! They had even ended up finding him in the-\n\n"Excuse me, Vetus? Did they find it?"\n\nVetus tried to collect himself. Where was he? Ah yes, the entrance. And this unicorn before him... Right! A student of the Animus Institute! And a talented one at that! He attempted a smile, though the muscle tissue in his face had long since rotted away.\n\nThe unicorn shuffled in place, seemingly unsure of whether or not he heard her. "Um, Vetus? Everything okay? I was really hoping that they found some information on 'Organic-Inscription Matrices' like I had requested."\n\nThe old lich was unresponsive for a moment. The unicorn was about to gently shake him, but his hoof suddenly rose, "Yes, actually. Right here." Vetus picked up one of the many tomes retrieved by the expedition and levitated it over to the unicorn before him.\n\nA wide smile spread across her face as she accepted the tome, "Oh, thank you so much! You have no idea how important this is to my research!" \n\nVetus stared at her as she began to leave. Such a nice young mare, she was. She trotted away with a spring in her step unique to few ponies in this forsaken corner of the world."

Known for his extensive narcissism, Corpus would have been just another lich if he had not possessed enough magical talent to overpower anyone who challenged him. Within his first few years of unlife, he had already proven himself to be more adept at necromancy than the vast majority of his peers. His skills attracted the attention of the Salvific Ossuary, which quickly inducted Corpus into their order.\n\nIn the centuries that followed, Corpus steadily rose through the ranks of the cult. This drew the ire of his fellow cultists, who knew that he obtained his positions not through religious zealotry, but through his natural talents. Perhaps the greatest heresy in their eyes was when Corpus became the High Priest in 941. Corpus didn't care about their religion in the slightest, but he couldn't resist the power that came with the position, for it earned him a seat on the Dread Council.\n\nSince then, he had neglected to do anything of substance for the religion he was in charge of, instead using and abusing his power to secure his position above all else. In 996, resentment within the cult's ranks had nearly reached a boiling point when their greatest wish came true: Corpus renounced his position as High Priest. He had taken a greater seat of power, one that previously belonged to the late Luvenis Maledicta, who had suffered her final death in her ill-fated conquest against the Arcturians.\n\nThus began the reign of the newest Dread King, Corpus Maledictus. A selfish lich who only takes action when it benefits him, and few are powerful enough to stand in his way.\n\n§YPortrait By:§! Neither"

Skellinore is not and never has been a warrior in her past life, and when the truth came out, her summoner was very displeased. Had any other necromancer done the deed, they would have cut the tendrils of unlife on a seemingly useless being.\n\nObit Animata, however, deemed the ritual of raising an intelligent undead too much of an investment to rid himself of Skellinore. He instead drafted the former scholar as a leader of his militia, despite Skellinore's reluctance and ineptitude.\n\nWith the threat of oblivion should she disappoint her new master, Skellinore had no choice but to take the helm as Obit Animata's militia leader. Though she had many difficulties, Skellinore has grown into her new position. In time, she has developed the logistical and experience needed to lead Obit Animata's hosts with a degree of competency that has yet to upset him.\n\nThis was not a path that Skellinore had ever considered in her previous life or this unlife. However, it is one that she can perhaps excel at despite all of the odds stacked against her. Maybe one day, she may even break free of her unlife of indentured servitude.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"
