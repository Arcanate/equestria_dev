 ### EQUIPMENT MODULES ###
 tank_composite_armor:0 "Composite Armor"
 tank_composite_armor_desc:0 "Adding a thin layer of silica glass between the armor plates dramatically increases armor effectiveness. Unfortunately, the technique is still in its infancy and somewhat unreliable, and very expensive to produce."
 tank_hydropneumatic_suspension:0 "Hydropneumatic Suspension"
 tank_hydropneumatic_suspension_desc:0 "This advanced system uses a mixture of gases and liquids to give unparalleled ride comfort, maneuverability in rough terrain, and speed, while not sacrificing on ease of maintenance. This comes at the cost of being considerably more expensive to produce."
 tank_anti_air_cannon_4:0 "Modern Anti-Air Gun"
 tank_anti_air_cannon_4_desc:0 "A fast-firing automatic gun designed to engage aircraft. It has limited potential as a fire-support weapon against ground targets."
 tank_anti_air_cannon_5:0 "Surface-to-Air Missiles"
 tank_anti_air_cannon_5_desc:0 "The newest rocket launcher, which can be mounted atop of tank, can hit aerial targets very effectively."
 tank_medium_cannon_3:0 "Advanced Medium Cannon"
 tank_medium_cannon_3_desc:0 "A general-purpose weapon well suited to a wide variety of tasks. It excels at neither anti-infantry nor anti-tank work, but it provides a vehicle with a lot of flexibility."
 tank_rocket_launcher_3:0 "Semi-Modern Rocket Launcher"
 tank_rocket_launcher_3_desc:0 "#TODO:"
 tank_rocket_launcher_4:0 "Modern Rocket Launcher"
 tank_rocket_launcher_4_desc:0 "#TODO:"
 tank_high_velocity_cannon_4:0 "Semi-Modern High-Velocity Cannon"
 tank_high_velocity_cannon_4_desc:0 "A cannon specifically designed to achieve a high muzzle velocity. Using specialized ammunition, it has superb anti-armor characteristics, but its performance against soft targets suffers."
 tank_high_velocity_cannon_5:0 "Modern High-Velocity Cannon"
 tank_high_velocity_cannon_5_desc:0 "A cannon specifically designed to achieve a high muzzle velocity. Using specialized ammunition, it has superb anti-armor characteristics, but its performance against soft targets suffers."
 tank_heavy_cannon_4:0 "Semi-Modern Heavy Cannon"
 tank_heavy_cannon_4_desc:0 "A weapon that can fire a large shell. With exceptional armor penetration and decent performance against soft targets, its biggest drawbacks are the sheer size and cost, which make it too unwieldy to be mounted in most vehicles not specifically designed to carry it."
 tank_heavy_cannon_5:0 "Modern Heavy Cannon"
 tank_heavy_cannon_5_desc:0 "A weapon that can fire a large shell. With exceptional armor penetration and decent performance against soft targets, its biggest drawbacks are the sheer size and cost, which make it too unwieldy to be mounted in most vehicles not specifically designed to carry it."
 tank_heavy_howitzer_2:0 "Improved Heavy Howitzer" 
 tank_heavy_howitzer_2_desc:0 "A heavy field howitzer adapted to be mounted in a vehicle. Its primary purpose is indirect fire support against soft targets, but it can be fired directly at a target if necessary. Carrying only a small amount of armor-piercing ammunition, it is ill-suited for anti-tank work."
 tank_heavy_howitzer_3:0 "Advanced Heavy Howitzer" 
 tank_heavy_howitzer_3_desc:0 "A heavy field howitzer adapted to be mounted in a vehicle. Its primary purpose is indirect fire support against soft targets, but it can be fired directly at a target if necessary. Carrying only a small amount of armor-piercing ammunition, it is ill-suited for anti-tank work."
 tank_super_heavy_howitzer:0 "Super-Heavy Howitzer"
 tank_super_heavy_howitzer_desc:0 "A truly gigantic howitzer capable of hurling shells larger than a pony at a target, this cannon offers unmatched destructive potential against soft targets."
 tank_super_heavy_howitzer_2:0 "Improved Super-Heavy Howitzer"
 tank_super_heavy_howitzer_2_desc:0 "A truly gigantic howitzer capable of hurling shells larger than a pony at a target, this cannon offers unmatched destructive potential against soft targets."
 tank_super_heavy_cannon_2:0 "Improved Super-Heavy Cannon"
 tank_super_heavy_cannon_2_desc:0 "An absurdly large weapon with unmatched performance. There are very few things that this weapon can not destroy, and none of them have any business shooting at a tank."
 tank_super_heavy_cannon_3:0 "Advanced Super-Heavy Cannon"
 tank_super_heavy_cannon_3_desc:0 "An absurdly large weapon with unmatched performance. There are very few things that this weapon can not destroy, and none of them have any business shooting at a tank."
 tank_radio_4:0 "Semi-Modern Radio"
 tank_radio_4_desc:0 "#TODO:"
 tank_radio_5:0 "Modern Radio"
 tank_radio_5_desc:0 "#TODO:"
 stabilizer_2:0 "Improved Stabilizer"
 stabilizer_2_desc:0 "A mechanical device to keep the gun pointing in the same direction when the tank is moving. While not advanced enough to allow accurate firing on the move, it does allow the gunner to fire accurately during a short stop, without having to re-acquire the target."
 oscillating_turret:0 "Oscillating Turret"
 oscillating_turret_desc:0 "By making the turret itself pivot up and down rather than having the gun do so, we can omit the usual traverse space inside the turret and mount a slightly more powerful cannon in our light tanks. This creates a major weakspot in the armour at the pivot point, which makes it unsuited for larger vehicles."
 gun_computer:0 "Fire Control Electronics"
 gun_computer_desc:0 "#TODO:"

 main_battle_tank_chassis_b:0 "First-Generation Main Battle Tank Chassis"
 main_battle_tank_chassis_b_short:0 "1st-Gen MBT Chassis"

 main_battle_tank_chassis_c_short:0 "2nd-Gen MBT Chassis"
 modern_tank_chassis_2:0 "1st-Gen MBT Chassis"
 modern_tank_chassis_2_desc:0 "The earliest Main Battle Tanks were uneasy forays into the field, often struggling with speed or armor. Lessons learned from them have paved the way for a true universal tank."
 modern_tank_chassis_3:0 "2nd-Gen MBT Chassis"
 modern_tank_chassis_3_desc:0 "Better armor, smarter electronics, stronger engines, and even the potential of a new composite armor and hydropneumatic suspension all make these tanks devastatingly powerful and versatile."
 modern_tank_artillery_chassis_2:0 "1st-Gen Modern SP Artillery"

 super_heavy_tank_chassis_2:0 "Improved Super-Heavy Tank Chassis"
 super_heavy_tank_chassis_3:0 "Advanced Super-Heavy Tank Chassis"

 super_heavy_tank_chassis_2_desc:0 "These tanks are rolling monstrosities, with high-caliber bunker smashing cannons and several layers of reinforced armor. But even with the most advanced engines and extra-wide double tracks, these tanks have trouble traversing marshes and have to ford rivers with a snorkel."
 super_heavy_tank_chassis_3_desc:0 "Faster treads allow these super heavy tanks to compete on the modern battlefield. High-caliber bunker smashing cannons and several layers of reinforced armor render them nearly unstoppable in a fair fight. While they will likely never reclaim dominance from the main battle tanks due to their reduced versatility, they nonetheless can provide devastating firepower when our troops need it most."
