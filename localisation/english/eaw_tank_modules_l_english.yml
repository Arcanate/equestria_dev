 gwtank_chassis:0 "Early Tank Development"
 gwtank_chassis_desc:0 "Inspired by the tales of Griffonian Knights with their heavy armour and equally heavy weaponry, the first tanks were created in 996 during their revolution by Stalliongrad ponies. Slow, mechanically unreliable, and poorly armoured, these rushed conversions of agricultural equipment were nonetheless effective against lightly armed infantry, and thus copied and imitated widely."
 armor_tech_1_desc:0 "Tanks during the Winter Revolution only had to contend with enemy small arms. As such, they got away with fairly thin armor. A new generation of anti-tank weaponry has made the battlefield a much more dangerous place for a tank, and much heavier protection is needed."
 engine_tech_1_desc:0 "Where the tanks of the Winter Revolution were slow, lumbering beasts, the modern tank relies very much on speed and mobility to achieve victory."
 basic_heavy_tank_chassis_desc:0 "A thorough analysis of recent military conflicts has shown that there is a need for a heavy vehicle to break through the enemy trench line and open up the way for lighter forces to exploit the breakthough. Such a vehicle should heavily armed and well armored, but doesn't have to be very fast."

 main_battle_tank_chassis_b_desc:0 "The earliest Main Battle Tanks were uneasy forays into the field, often struggling with speed or armor. Lessons learned from them have paved the way for a true universal tank."
 main_battle_tank_chassis_c_short:0 "2nd-Gen MBT Chassis"
 main_battle_tank_chassis_c:0 "Second-Generation Main Battle Tank Chassis"
 main_battle_tank_chassis_c_desc:0 "Better armor, smarter electronics, stronger engines, and even the potential of a new composite armor all make these tanks devastatingly powerful and versatile."
