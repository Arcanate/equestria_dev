 ### FOCUS ###
 CTH_zarcid_legacy:0 "Lean on the Zarcid Legacy"
 CTH_zarcid_legacy_desc:0 "The Zarca family is more than just a powerful political family. To many Colthaginians, the Zarcids are exemplars of the power and glory of the country's history. By invoking the family name, we will be able to appoint some loyalists to important bureaucratic positions, which should allow us some political momentum to deal with the hampered economy and the unrest in the provinces."

 CTH_bread_or_stick_politics:0 "Bread or Stick Politics"
 CTH_bread_or_stick_politics_desc:0 "Zamilcar Zarca's bread or stick politics was an informal system of patronage. Less influential chiefs, landowners and other community leaders would get bread or other help for their people in return for backing Zamilcar whenever he needed them while those who refused would be forced out of politics. The Storm King broke a lot of these informal bonds, and it will take time to reforge them."

 CTH_reintroduce_poltical_chiefs:0 "Reintroduce Political Chiefs"
 CTH_reintroduce_poltical_chiefs_desc:0 "The regional divides of Colthaginian society are not a new phenomenon. Zamilcar Zarca dealt with this problem by assigning political chiefs, a local office used to undermine dissidents, which proved effective. When we lost political control after the Storm King's invasion, the system collapsed, but we can bring the chiefs back from retirement to reassert control over the countryside."
 
 CTH_reinforce_the_western_garrisons:0 "Reshuffle the Western Garrisons"
 CTH_reinforce_the_western_garrisons_desc:0 "Guarding the border with Hippogriff occupied Zumidia has been regarded as an easy assignment for years. The zebra in the area are usually loyal, unlike the meddlesome Coltvans. However, rumours of Zanno's return have fired up the local youth and the lazy garrison is doing nothing to stop their rallies. Replacing the garrison with veterans from Coltva will teach these foals the strength of Colthage."

 CTH_crackdown_on_the_western_bandits:0 "Crackdown on Western Bandits"
 CTH_crackdown_on_the_western_bandits_desc:0 "The lazy western garrisons have let bandits fester in the west, making us look weak and aiding Zanno Mzelqatid's movement. With real soldiers now stationed in the area, we can begin to root out the criminals and restore order to the land. Our new political chiefs will investigate bandit strongholds, so we can decisively rid ourselves of this problem."

 CTH_fortify_the_west:0 "Fortify the Zumidian Border"
 CTH_fortify_the_west_desc:0 "The greedy Hippogriffs are still occupying our brethren in Zumidia and tensions along the border are high. State of the art fortifications in the border provinces will serve as anchor points for our defence and bases for our inevitable assault. Aztarte, the war goddess, will not allow another inch of zebra land be conquered."

 CTH_expand_the_coastal_forts:0 "Zam's Redoubts"
 CTH_expand_the_coastal_forts_desc:0 "Our ports are the heart of our prosperity and the rivers the veins that spread our wealth to the rest of the people. Zam is the god who oversees this great system of life, and he does so justly. However, Zargon, Lord Under the Sea, known as The Dark One, envies Zam's wealth, striking the surface from his dark domain. Just like wise Zam, we must defend our heart from attacks out of the depths of the sea."

 CTH_fortify_the_capital:0 "Bastion Zanit"
 CTH_fortify_the_capital_desc:0 "Colthage is our home, our mother. Without her, we would be nothing. It is Zanit, the stalwart wife of Za'al, who wept when Colthage was sullied by the Storm King. Upon Zanit, Zalathel Zarca has taken a precious oath, swearing that never again our homes will be in peril. We will build a bastion that will become our sacred guardian, a true successor to our famed city walls. And Zanit will weep no more."

 CTH_appoint_zakbar:0 "Co-Sufrit Baltazar Zakbar"
 CTH_appoint_zakbar_desc:0 "Zalathel is not fond of Baltazar, who is a boring zebra, seemingly without much ambition. The old stallion's greatest joy is balancing budgets and his favourite pastime is chairing board room meetings. However, Zamilcar put great faith in him back in the day, and the commercial faction of the Scientific Clique loves him. And best of all, he can do all the paperwork."

 CTH_anti_corruption_initiative:0 "Anti-Corruption Initiative"
 CTH_anti_corruption_initiative_desc:0 "As we attempt to restore order in the countryside, matters are not helped at all by the stench of corruption that every citizen can smell wafting off of the government. Far too many officials neglect their duties, instead using their positions to steal from the public and enrich themselves. It is clear that good, honest administration will be needed in order to get things back on track."

 CTH_scientific_management:0 "Scientific Management"
 CTH_scientific_management_desc:0 "Although decades have passed since the Industrial Revolution was first brought to Colthage, when it comes to production our way of thinking remains stuck in the old craft production mindset. Rather than staying slaves to established traditions, empirical methods should be used to determine new, efficient procedures that maximise labour productivity."

 CTH_mechanized_agriculture:0 "Mechanise Agriculture"
 CTH_mechanized_agriculture_desc:0 "With the advent of industrialisation and the development of complex machines, farming methods have taken a truly massive leap forward. This modern equipment will be costly to acquire, but since mechanisation would allow our farmers to get more work done per day than has ever been possible before, the expense is well worth it."

 CTH_technological_exchange:0 "Propose Technological Exchange To Wingbardy"
 CTH_technological_exchange_desc:0 "Non-governmental technological exchanges between Colthage and Wingbardy have taken place since the late 970s, and the resulting transfer of technical knowledge has been greatly beneficial. An official technological exchange programme would be a fantastic opportunity for our technicians to gain knowledge about the development of science and technology in the world."
 
 CTH_secular_education:0 "Secular Education"
 CTH_secular_education_desc:0 "In our country, education has moved from being the preserve of parents and informal communities to being the concern of trained specialists funded by public taxes. Therefore, public schools should be kept separated from any specific religious institution. Instruction in religion is the domain of parents and their religions, not the business of the state education system."

 CTH_appoint_zaryes:0 "Co-Sufrit Batrun Zaryes"
 CTH_appoint_zaryes_desc:0 "A zebra of true Colthaginian passions, Batrun Zaryes is Zarca's favoured pick for Co-Sufrit. As a general, Zaryes openly disfavours the scientific clique, but has widespread popular support both among civilians and soldiers. Appointing Batrun as Co-Sufrit will not only help prepare the populace for conflict, it should also placate the military for the time being."

 CTH_war_is_a_racket:0 "Everyone Has Their Price"
 CTH_war_is_a_racket_desc:0 "Troublingly, reports indicate that there are many in the army who harbour sympathies toward the Constitutionalist cause. Zaryes believes a round of bribes will be the most effective way to guarantee the loyalty of our soldiers and generals: after all, self-interest is a more powerful motivator than any lofty ideal."
 
 CTH_rearmament:0 "Re-Armament"
 CTH_rearmament_desc:0 "A substantial portion of Colthage's military industry was destroyed in the aftermath of the Storm King's invasion. Given the dire threats we face, ensuring the security of the nation will require completely rebuilding this productive capacity."
 
 CTH_learn_from_the_storm:0 "Lessons From The Storm"
 CTH_learn_from_the_storm_desc:0 "Although it is painful to remember, Zaryes knows that there are lessons we must learn from the Storm King's invasion, especially in regards to the importance of military air power. It would be wise for us to study the nature of our defeat, and avoid repeating the same mistakes in the future."

 CTH_rural_guard:0 "Restore The Rural Guard"
 CTH_rural_guard_desc:0 "First established as an official constabulary by Zamilcar Zarca in 981, the Rural Guard was a ruthless and efficient organisation primarily responsible for eliminating unrest in the countryside. However, they disintegrated in the chaos that followed the Storm King's invasion. It is clear that this organisation will be needed once again if we are to maintain order in the east."

 CTH_hire_better_mercs:0 "Rebuild A Professional Army"
 CTH_hire_better_mercs_desc:0 "Although we have made use of mercenaries as a stopgap in recent years, their unreliability makes them unsuited to serve as the core of our army, and putting our faith in them to defend the nation would be the height of foolishness. Zaryes has a plan to rebuild a truly professional army, using experienced veterans and the Sacred Band to train these new soldiers."

 CTH_appoint_zorrzel:0 "Co-Sufrit Zaron Zorrel"
 CTH_appoint_zorrzel_desc:0 "Zaron Zorrel is mild-mannered and not very ambitious: the perfect political puppet. There is no doubt that Zorrel will happily do anything the Zarcids want. However, his acute lack of imagination makes him incapable of formulating any policies of his own."

 CTH_draw_up_a_new_constitution:0 "The Zarcid Constitution"
 CTH_draw_up_a_new_constitution_desc:0 "With all the political offices filled, it is time to fully return to political normalcy. Zalathel is accused of being a dictator, of his rule being unconstitutional. The same accusations were heard during his father's reign. But with majority support in the Senate, Zalathel can do what Zamilcar did not: Make his extensive powers enshrined in the constitution."

 CTH_appease_opposition:0 "Appease The Opposition"
 CTH_appease_opposition_desc:0 "Now that Zalathel's hold on power is firmly secure, it would be prudent to make some liberal concessions to the senatorial opposition in order to secure their support. The best way to defuse the tensions that still linger among the elite of Colthage and restore order is by getting them on our side."
 
 CTH_persecute_opposition:0 "Persecute The Opposition"
 CTH_persecute_opposition_desc:0 "Up until now, our excessive leniency has enabled senatorial opposition to plot with radical agitators and stir up unrest across the country. Zalathel will use the power of the One Hundred Twenty Seven—the highest tribunal in the land—to persecute prominent members of the opposition and push them out of office, paving the way for future stability."

 CTH_religious_education:0 "Religious Education"
 CTH_religious_education_desc:0 "Despite what some arrogant zebras may claim, the gods we worship are what bind us together as Colthaginians, being a central part of our shared culture. Having this reflected in their education will provide our children with vital moral instruction and encourage them to be responsible, spiritually sound adults."

 CTH_national_reconstruction:0 "National Reconstruction Programme"
 CTH_national_reconstruction_desc:0 "The aftermath of the Storm King's invasion left serious hardship throughout the country: hardship which can no longer be ignored. Zalathel plans to initiate a massive economic recovery effort. Best of all, he is generously using his own family funds to help support the project!"

 CTH_rebuild_professional_army:0 "Improve Mercenary Hiring Standards"
 CTH_rebuild_professional_army_desc:0 "In our hour of greatest need, the professional army under Zamilcar Zarca disgraced itself and failed to defend Colthage from the Storm King. With this in mind, Zalathel has decided to continue using mercenaries, albeit with increased hiring standards. He has also ordered a purge of incompetent mercenaries from our ranks."

 CTH_sacrifice_to_zaal:0 "A Divine Sacrifice"
 CTH_sacrifice_to_zaal_desc:0 "Dire times such as these call for a sacrifice to the gods in order to bring us fortune. To gain divine favour for Colthage, Zalathel shall attend a grand ceremony, during which he will choose which deity of the pantheon to venerate."
 
 CTH_demand_war_reparations:0 "Demand War Reparations"
 CTH_demand_war_reparations_desc:0 "Although the Storm King may be dead, that does not undo all the abuses and injustices we suffered due to his onslaught. Zalathel thinks it's only right that the Yeti should pay for all the damage they did to our great homeland, and so he will dispatch a diplomat to the south to demand compensation."
 
 CTH_anti_regionalism:0 "The Old Debate"
 CTH_anti_regionalism_desc:0 "Troublingly, recent years have witnessed a surge in regionalist sentiment and resistance to lawful authority across the country. Centralists have dominated Colthage ever since they defeated the federalists in the civil war in 840. But after all that has happened since then, perhaps it is time to reconsider things..."
 
 CTH_naval_rearmament:0 "Regain Naval Supremacy"
 CTH_naval_rearmament_desc:0 "Long ago, Colthage was a foremost naval power of the ancient world, holding complete dominion over the Middle Sea before suffering catastrophic defeat at the claws of Karthin. We must not despair: for if we dedicate ourselves, it is within our power to regain this glory once again."
 
 CTH_invite_foreign_advisors:0 "Invite Foreign Military Advisors"
 CTH_invite_foreign_advisors_desc:0 "To further improve the performance of our army, we should open the door for foreign nations to aid us with military training and organization. Their valuable insights on modern warfare will help increase the effectiveness of the Colthaginian army, as well as allowing us to develop our future military leaders."

 CTH_reinvigorate_trade:0 "Reinvigorate Commerce"
 CTH_reinvigorate_trade_desc:0 "Colthage was once an economic powerhouse built on overseas and overland trade: a mercantile civilisation which transported valuable luxuries across vast distances. This brought us great prosperity that we can regain by establishing a new, robust network of trade."
 
 CTH_distribute_food:0 "Distribute Food To The Poor"
 CTH_distribute_food_desc:0 "The causes of our lackluster agricultural output are uninteresting and unimportant. What's important is that the solution is simple: Zalathel will set up a grain dole to feed the starving and impoverished. This will help to improve their conditions, as well as build up his own popularity with the masses."
 
 CTH_import_weapons:0 "Import Weapons"
 CTH_import_weapons_desc:0 "It is difficult to win wars from a position of technological inferiority. If we buy modern guns from independent contractors in Tobuck and Wingbardy and study their designs, we can build up an arms stockpile while at the same time working towards developing our own models of comparable effectiveness."

 CTH_establish_air_force:0 "Establish The Colthaginian Air Force"
 CTH_establish_air_force_desc:0 "Of all the military lessons we have been forced to learn in recent years, the most pressing one is that the importance of air power cannot be overlooked any longer. It is time that we create our own dedicated branch for air service. The only question is how exactly this new air force should be organized."
 
 CTH_increased_exports:0 "Strengthen Domestic Production"
 CTH_increased_exports_desc:0 "It is not enough to merely trade goods: exporting Colthaginian-made products to foreign markets is an equally important aspect of our revitalisation. Utilising new technology to improve our manufacturing sector will make our exports far more competitive, giving the economy a much-needed boost."
 
 CTH_blatant_nepotism:0 "Blood Is Thicker Than Water"
 CTH_blatant_nepotism_desc:0 "In order for an administration to function effectively, the loyalty of officials in high positions must not be in doubt. To this end, Zalathel shall call on his trusted siblings Zago, Zasdrubal, and Zaphod, and ask them to take up important posts atop the government and military."

 CTH_state_controlled_media:0 "The Rise Of Mass Media"
 CTH_state_controlled_media_desc:0 "As they become accessible to more and more zebras, radios and newspapers are growing increasingly popular and becoming ever more influential on public opinion. Depending on our approach, these new innovations could serve to either bolster or weaken our rule. We must decide on how the government should handle the media, before it spirals out of our control."
 
 CTH_steel_elephants:0 "Elephants Of Steel"
 CTH_steel_elephants_desc:0 "The legendary North Zebrican elephants went extinct in Colthage many centuries ago—those mighty beasts were incredibly effective at charging into enemy lines and breaking their ranks. Fortunately, new technology allows us to create new kinds of war elephants, ones equally capable of striking fear into the hearts of our foes."

 CTH_armoured_convoys:0 "Armoured Convoys"
 CTH_armoured_convoys_desc:0 "As we send increasing numbers of merchant ships out to sea, the corresponding threat posed by piracy grows more acute. We must develop more effective naval convoy tactics to protect this vital shipping and ward off any potential attackers."
 
 CTH_strategic_mining_crap:0 "Strategic Resource Gathering Operations"
 CTH_strategic_mining_crap_desc:0 "A group of prominent Scientifids have proposed we begin what they call Strategic Resource Gathering Operations, or SRGOs for short. These would be a series of geological surveys all across the country, followed by state-funded mining operations to extract whatever worthwhile deposits are discovered."
 
 CTH_naval_academy:0 "The Naval Academy Of Colthage"
 CTH_naval_academy_desc:0 "Truly modernising the Navy requires us to create a new academic institution where civilian professors and military instructors will educate the next generation of Colthaginian officers. At this academy, students will be provided instruction on everything from engineering and mathematics to the value of integrity and honour."
 
 CTH_ultramarines:0 "Retrain The Citizen-Marines"
 CTH_ultramarines_desc:0 "Marines in the Colthaginian Navy have traditionally been recruited from the citizenry rather than being mercenaries. Although they fight with undeniable zeal, their discipline has often been lacking, greatly limiting their effectiveness. Zalathel plans to rectify this by turning them into highly trained professional soldiers."
 
 CTH_army_motorization:0 "Dedicated Military Vehicles"
 CTH_army_motorization_desc:0 "Rather than using forcefully-commandeered civilian vehicles, the army should begin to use dedicated military trucks in its operations. We have settled on a more robust model of truck based on existing Wingbardian designs. This model, built to withstand the stresses of combat, is sure to offer superior performance and serve our soldiers well."
 
 CTH_revitalized_economy:0 "Revitalised Economy"
 CTH_revitalized_economy_desc:0 "Thanks to flourishing trade, the economy is booming and zebras across the land are becoming richer—all a result of Zalathel's tireless efforts. Colthage rejoices, for the years of stagnation and despair are now firmly behind us!"
 
 CTH_fate_of_judiciary:0 "Fate Of The One Hundred And Twenty Seven"
 CTH_fate_of_judiciary_desc:0 "As Zalathel continues to shape the future of Colthage, one of the most pressing questions is what to do about the One Hundred And Twenty Seven. This aristocratic judiciary has long held great power and influence, and leaving them alone could allow them to someday challenge the Sufrit's authority."
 
 CTH_zagos_agricultural_manual:0 "Zago's Agricultural Manual"
 CTH_zagos_agricultural_manual_desc:0 "Wishing to impart his extensive wisdom, Zago Zarca has written a 28-book manual on agriculture filled to the brim with farming knowledge. This manual, which is already proving a hit with landowners, shall be published with state support so that more zebras can make use of the advice within."
 
 CTH_auxiliary_soldiers:0 "Organise Auxiliary Units"
 CTH_auxiliary_soldiers_desc:0 "The Auxiliary Units of the old Colthaginian Army were specialized combat formations made up of non-citizens and non-Zonicians recruited from the Republic's territory. These units provided vital support to the Army in the past, and restoring them will allow us to make the most of the population we have available."
 
 CTH_disband_the_clique:0 "Disband The Scientific Clique"
 CTH_disband_the_clique_desc:0 "Now that Colthage's economy has fully recovered and the nation is modernised, the Scientific Clique has outlived its usefulness. With the help of the military, Zalathel will move to arrest its most prominent members, permanently breaking Scientifid power."
 
 CTH_fate_of_popular_assembly:0 "Abolish The Popular Assembly"
 CTH_fate_of_popular_assembly_desc:0 "The Popular Assembly—the lower house of the legislature—has been defunct for years with little real political power. It is also a nest of Constitutionalist supporters and other subversives: the Senate would be quite pleased if this unneeded relic were to be abolished."

 CTH_separation_of_military_and_politics:0 "Civilian Control Of The Military"
 CTH_separation_of_military_and_politics_desc:0 "With his relatives in commanding military positions and with the tribunal of One Hundred and Twenty Seven on his side, Zalathel is in a strong enough position to dismiss Zaryes and impose strict government control over the military. After all, a country's strategic decision-making belongs in the hooves of its political leader, not military officers."
 
 CTH_one_sufrit_above_all:0 "One Sufrit Above All"
 CTH_one_sufrit_above_all_desc:0 "As the recent period of chaos and confusion demonstrated so clearly, Colthage is weak when divided into squabbling factions, and strong only when united behind a single leader. And so it is time for Colthage to have only a single Sufrit, who rules supreme over the entire nation."
 
# Economic
 CTH_invite_wingbardian_investors:0 "The Eler Sea Agreement"
 CTH_invite_wingbardian_investors_desc:0 "Though it is north of us, the "Jewel of the South" is well-known for its industrial might. Some in our government have proposed the idea of offering a dedicated investment zone in our capital for the Wingbardians. This will bolster our economic throughput, provided that they accept the proposition."

 CTH_replant_the_cash_crops:0 "Cotton Plantations"
 CTH_replant_the_cash_crops_desc:0 "Cotton! One of the more useful materials for clothing, and in ever-growing demand across the sea! We already have suitable land to grow cotton in; if we incentivise the growing of cash crops instead of staple foods, we will increase our export value and please the landowners."

 CTH_colthage_zur_industrial_zone:0 "Colthage-Zur Special Economic Zone"
 CTH_colthage_zur_industrial_zone_desc:0 "Colthage and Zur are the two regions the investors from Wingbardy are most interested in. The griffons see potential in developing the ports and industrial centres in the country's centre. By laxing investment laws and shaking the right claws, we can bring in the capital needed to build up our most promising cities."
 
 CTH_agwp_colthage:0 "AGWP Colthage"
 CTH_agwp_colthage_desc:0 "Our oil deposits in Sophoovene are quite plentiful, but we have had trouble extracting the black gold from some of the jungles in the region. Fortunately, one of the companies interested in expanding their operations is Wingbardy's own Azienda Generale Wingbardia Petroli, one of the finest experts on oil in the world."
 
 CTH_czsez_council:0 "CZSEZ Development Council"
 CTH_czsez_council_desc:0 "Though our industry in the CZSEZ has flourished, investors are being held back by intransigent locals. Our foreign friends have proposed a Development Council to oversee the growth of business in these cities. The idea of letting businessgriffons into the administration does not sit well with the citizens of Colthage and Zur, but they will not complain for long after they see the prosperity these foreigners bring."

 CTH_concentration_principle:0 "Mass Industrial Concentration"
 CTH_concentration_principle_desc:0 "We've made reasonable strides in industrialising some of our coastline, but [Root.GetLeader] believes that we can do more. By focusing all our efforts on our Special Economic Zones, we can turn Zur and Colthage into metropoles worthy of the legacy of our entrepreneurial people. The market of Colthage will yet be the envy of Zebrica!"
 
 CTH_export_priority:0 "Reclaim our Mercantile Legacy"
 CTH_export_priority_desc:0 "With all of the effort that we have put into our main port cities, we are set to become the greatest trade hub in northern Zebrica. We are now set to follow the path of our ancestors and again sail the seas to Griffonia, to sell our wares in the markets of Midoria, Karthin and beyond and to bring back the coin of our beloved customers."
 
 CTH_feathara_university:0 "Feathara University - Colthage Branch"
 CTH_feathara_university_desc:0 "Being one of the most prestigious centres of learning in Wingbardy, the University of Feathara would be an excellent school to model our higher education facilities after. As it so happens, they have expressed interest in establishing a sister school here in Colthage! We had already set aside a plot of land area for a school, so this should work out quite nicely."
 
 CTH_phase_out_slavery:0 "Phase Out Slavery"
 CTH_phase_out_slavery_desc:0 "Early into the Eler Sea Agreement, several investors and traders expressed concern in our continued use of slaves. This concern has grown over the past several months into veiled threats to abandon the CZSEZ unless we do something about it. In the interest of not having the metaphorical rug pulled out from under our thriving economy, we will begin preparations to transition away from slavery."
 
 CTH_fruits_of_partnership:0 "The Fruits of Partnership"
 CTH_fruits_of_partnership_desc:0 "Investors bring capital, which is invested into production capacity. All these factories need zebras to work in them, not only labourers but all sorts of skilled engineers and technicians. The griffons have brought not only wealth, but also the knowledge needed to advance our economy. We have planted the tree of prosperity, and now she finally bears the sweet fruit of our labour."
 
 CTH_reward_minor_warlords:0 "Reward Warlords"
 CTH_reward_minor_warlords_desc:0 "Central authority has been shaky ever since the defeat of the Storm King, and many soldiers are loyal to their military leaders over the government in Colthage. Connecting the country requires more than physical infrastructure, it also requires these key figures to support our cause.

With support in both the Senate and the army, Baltazar must move quickly to seize power and begin solidifying the Scientifids' position: they now represent Colthage's best hope for political order and economic progress."

 CTH_scientific_politics:0 "Scientific Politics"
 CTH_scientific_politics_desc:0 "A core Scientifid principle is the idea that a nation's problems should be approached and its policies formulated scientifically. At present, there is an ongoing debate over what exact form the government should take—Scientifids are split on the question of what political system accords with the laws of nature and is best suited to the current material conditions of Colthage."
 
 CTH_secular_education_2:0 "Secular Education"
 CTH_secular_education_2_desc:0 "In our country, education has moved from being the preserve of parents and informal communities to being the concern of trained specialists funded by public taxes. Therefore, public schools should be kept separated from any specific religious institution. Instruction in religion is the domain of parents and their religions, not the business of the state education system."
 
 CTH_economic_calculation_debate:0 "Economic Calculation Debate"
 CTH_economic_calculation_debate_desc:0 "Although all agree on the paramount importance of promoting economic development, Scientifids are divided as to how Colthage's economy should function and what role the state should play in it. Some favour economic planning as a resource allocation mechanism, while others argue that a free market is the more efficient solution."

 CTH_expeditions_and_experiments_desc:0 "Our new age shall be one guided by science, with policies built upon observation, experiment, and facts, not upon dogmas and abstractions. With full access to state funds and legislation, science no longer has any monetary or legal limitations: the possibilities are endless. It's time to get to work!"
 
 CTH_anti_corruption_initiative_2:0 "Anti-Corruption Initiative"
 CTH_anti_corruption_initiative_2_desc:0 "As we attempt to restore order in the countryside, matters are not helped at all by the stench of corruption that every citizen can smell wafting off of the government. Far too many officials neglect their duties, instead using their positions to steal from the public and enrich themselves. It is clear that good, honest administration will be needed in order to get things back on track."
 
 CTH_rapid_recovery_plan:0 "Rapid Recovery Plan"
 CTH_rapid_recovery_plan_desc:0 "The aftermath of the Storm King's invasion left a huge amount of devastation in its wake. These wounds are still fresh, and there are few in Colthage who emerged unscathed. We must move quickly to repair this damage, as material improvements are vital to promoting societal development."
 
 CTH_medical_science:0 "Wonders Of Medical Science"
 CTH_medical_science_desc:0 "Modern medicine is more capable than ever before of improving the physical health and well-being of creatures. In light of this, adequately funding Colthaginian medical research is of the utmost importance, and so is widely distributing medicine to the populace. After all, healthy citizens make for a healthy society!"
 
 CTH_student_exchange:0 "Student Exchange Programmes"
 CTH_student_exchange_desc:0 "Applying the methods of science to improve our own society requires that we learn all we can from other countries' experiences. Foreigners have plenty of knowledge to share, and so we shall establish student exchange programmes to increase students' understanding of other cultures, as well as improving their language skills and broadening their horizons."
 
 CTH_on_religion:0 "The Status Of Religion"
 CTH_on_religion_desc:0 "Tensions are rising between those who believe "superstitious practices" have no place in an age of science, and others who claim trying to suppress such traditions will lead to social anarchy. True, it has long been claimed that science and religion are the opposites, but perhaps they can co-exist? A debate must be held to determine the fate of religion in Colthage."
 
 CTH_mechanized_agriculture_2:0 "Mechanize Agriculture"
 CTH_mechanized_agriculture_2_desc:0 "With the advent of industrialisation and the development of complex machines, farming methods have taken a truly massive leap forward. This modern equipment will be costly to acquire, but since mechanisation would allow our farmers to get more work done per day than has ever been possible before, the expense is well worth it."
 
 CTH_academy_of_applied_alchemy:0 "Open The Academy Of Applied Alchemy"
 CTH_academy_of_applied_alchemy_desc:0 "Charlatans who try to hide potionmaking in a shroud of mysticism impede those who truly seek to understand the nature of magic. Greed and ignorance is all that motivates such zebras. We must train a generation of educated potionmakers: ones who will utilise the superior methods of science to develop new and even stronger recipes."
 
 CTH_eugenics_are_totally_not_pseudoscience_my_dudes:0 "The Eugenics Controversy"
 CTH_eugenics_are_totally_not_pseudoscience_my_dudes_desc:0 "It has been theorised that the process of social evolution goes hoof and hoof with evolution of species that make up society, meaning we should be concerned with the genetic state of the population. But this view is far from universal, and there is a heated debate among Scientifids about exactly how scientific or ethical this field of eugenics is, and if a policy of "guided evolution" should be implemented at all."

 CTH_land_reform_debate:0 "The Issue Of Land Reform"
 CTH_land_reform_debate_desc:0 "Scientifids were the architects of the current rural order where magnates control large swathes of land and dominate peasants. This system produced impressive results, greatly increasing the productivity of the land and contributing to Colthage's economic miracle after 975. However, some Scientifids are beginning to suggest reforms will be necessary to ensure future stability in the countryside."

 CTH_bigass_goddamn_dam:0 "Construct The Grand Bagraza Dam"
 CTH_bigass_goddamn_dam_desc:0 "Forward-looking engineers have long dreamt of constructing a massive dam on the Bagraza river near the capital: one capable of providing electricity for the entire city of Colthage. Now with full national resources at our disposal, we can finally turn their dreams into reality."

 CTH_social_engineering_program:0 "Social Engineering Programme"
 CTH_social_engineering_program_desc:0 "Our citizens need to be enlightened so they learn critical thinking and better appreciate the benefits of Scientifid rule. Fortunately, the rise of mass media now enables social engineering to be undertaken on a grand scale—we can mould the beliefs and behaviours of the common populace in a way never before possible."
 
 CTH_yale_of_zebrica:0 "The Yale Of Zebrica"
 CTH_yale_of_zebrica_desc:0 "We are bold enough to ask questions few others dare to ask and seek the truth, no matter where it might lead us. With this noble spirit, the methods of science are being applied to the practical ends of economic development, social regeneration, and political unity. Without doubt, Colthage has become the intellectual capital of northern Zebrica, if not the entire continent!"

 CTH_gain_army_loyalty:0 "Ensure Military Loyalty"
 CTH_gain_army_loyalty_desc:0 "Batrun Zaryes is popular among soldiers and also commands the respect of his fellow generals. Although his dislike for the Scientifids is well known, his cooperation absolutely must be secured if our regime is to remain in power."

 CTH_coltvan_problem:0 "The Coltvan Problem"
 CTH_coltvan_problem_desc:0 "While our attention has been focused elsewhere, the situation in Coltva continues to further deteriorate. Ambitious bandits are inciting peasants to revolt left and right, causing massive disruptions to the region's economy. The army is demanding that we do something about this backwater province before it slips from our grasp completely."
 
 CTH_foundation_of_order:0 "A Foundation Of Order"
 CTH_foundation_of_order_desc:0 "Our administration is the only thing preventing Colthage from slipping into an age of ignorance and anarchy. To solidify our rule, we will use the army to maintain order in the country by repressing unrest and cracking down on dissent. As the formula goes: 'Order as the basis, progress as the goal.'"
 
 CTH_retake_kar_alpaka_2:0 "Retake Kar-Alpaka"
 CTH_retake_kar_alpaka_2_desc:0 "Llambet seized the Coltvan state of Kar-Alpaka from us after the Storm King's invasion in order to gain sea access for themselves. Since then the territory has been out of our hooves, but the army is adamant that the time has come for these lost lands to be retaken."
 
 CTH_lessons_from_insurgency:0 "Learning From The Insurgency"
 CTH_lessons_from_insurgency_desc:0 "Many months of fighting in Coltva has given us a tremendous amount of experience in fighting irregular forces. This knowledge should be put to use developing our counter-insurgency tactics. We must take a holistic view and catalogue all military, political, economic, psychological, and civic actions that should be taken to defeat an insurgency."

 CTH_reform_the_army:0 "Reform The Army"
 CTH_reform_the_army_desc:0 "As a result of decisions made by the previous administration, high-ranking military leaders have expressed concern over the state of Colthage's army. In particular, Batrun Zaryes doubts that we are properly prepared to face an invasion from any external threat, and wishes to see us greatly reduce our reliance on mercenaries in favour of building a professional army."
 
 CTH_pacify_the_south:0 "Pacify The South"
 CTH_pacify_the_south_desc:0 "Quaggatai struck in the south and seized Coltdar after the Storm King's invasion, taking advantage of our temporarily weakened state. Now that we have recovered our strength, the military is urging us to destroy the Khanate and retake Coltdar, to permanently neutralise the threat posed by their hordes."
 
 CTH_invest_in_mil_research:0 "Divert Resources To Military Research"
 CTH_invest_in_mil_research_desc:0 "The army is asking us to dedicate more resources towards national defence, and away from our current focus on social and natural sciences. There is wisdom to this request: developing new and more formidable weapons systems will no doubt prove vital in securing Colthage's borders against foreign aggression."

 CTH_found_airforce:0 "Establish An Air Force"
 CTH_found_airforce_desc:0 "The Storm King's devastating invasion clearly demonstrated the value of air power on the modern battlefield. In light of this, the military wishes for us to establish an air force, although they are not in complete agreement on what precise role it should have."
 
 CTH_develop_ship_tech:0 "Develop New Ship Types"
 CTH_develop_ship_tech_desc:0 "Long ago, Colthage was a foremost naval power of the ancient world, holding complete dominion over the Middle Sea before suffering catastrophic defeat at the claws of Karthin. Desiring to regain some of this glory once again, the military is asking us to research new hulls and armaments for our naval vessels."
 
 CTH_civilize_savages:0 "Civilize The Savages"
 CTH_civilize_savages_desc:0 "While the zebras of Coltdar are happy to rejoin civilisation, the barbaric zebras of Quaggatai and Buckhara remain backwards and brutish. They are less capable of adjusting to modernity due to centuries of stunted development. It is our duty to civilize them, and aid in their advancement to the point where they can assimilate into Colthaginian society."

 CTH_army_academy:0 "Open A Military Academy"
 CTH_army_academy_desc:0 "A rationally organised military is incompatible with the practice of leaders rising through the ranks based solely on personal connections. And so we shall open an academy where skillful generals are promoted regardless of their familiar or political affiliation. After all, a true meritocracy does not judge zebras by their stripes."

 CTH_army_mechanization:0 "Military Mechanization"
 CTH_army_mechanization_desc:0 "Having lacked dedicated military vehicles up to now, the army is being forced to make due with forcefully-commandeered civilian vehicles. We must make it our priority to design and produce military trucks for their operations—this will greatly increase their mobility, as they would no longer be forced to rely as heavily on arduous marches or preexisting railroads."
 
 CTH_proclaim_neutrality:0 "Proclaim Neutrality"
 CTH_proclaim_neutrality_desc:0 "The Scientifids know that war is inherently destructive and harmful to progress, and that we must do all we can to avoid it if possible. As a civil government with no desire to get embroiled in regional conflicts, we will proclaim Colthage to be a neutral nation. Militarists will obviously be displeased, but that is all part of the plan..."

 CTH_experimental_weaponry:0 "Experimental Weaponry"
 CTH_experimental_weaponry_desc:0 "The military has requested that we direct our research and development undertakings towards experimenting with and developing new types of weapons. As we press beyond the frontiers of current knowledge, we will no doubt uncover all kinds of exotic technologies that could be used for warfare."

 CTH_purge_the_military:0 "Purge The Military"
 CTH_purge_the_military_desc:0 "Militarist attempts to intimidate the government have gone on for long enough. Their protest of the neutrality proclamation was the last straw, and all the justification needed. With the support of meritocratically promoted generals, the ranks of the military will be purged and all incompetent, warmongering, and corrupt generals will be releived of duty."

 CTH_order_and_progress:0 "Order And Progress"
 CTH_order_and_progress_desc:0 "Thanks to the efforts of the Scientifids, Colthage's future now lies in the hooves of managers and administrators: wise experts who are above politics and unaffected by the play of interests. Under their direction, the citizens of Colthage now enjoy the benefits of an era of peace, economic development, and social stability. At last, the age of science has truly arrived!"

 colthage_coltvan.1.t:0 "The New Commander of The East"
 colthage_coltvan.1.d_annizalid:0 ""Father, how did you deal with generals as problematic as these?" Zalathel Zarca, Sufrit of Colthage and heir to the Zarca Family's power, sighed as he looked up to the portrait of his father. The only answer he received was Zamilcar's proud gaze staring down from his office's wall. Taking power had been easy, but one particular problem of the Zarca inheritance was frustrating Zalathel: Coltva.\n\nJust like himself, the Coltvans had fought a war of attrition against the Storm King, but now they resisted Colthaginian control as well. Under the guise of land reform, rebel leader Zeshmunazash Zeirutid rallied the forces of Coltva. The situation was dire. Although the Colthaginian forces outgunned the rebels for now, they lacked a clear strategy. To crush the rebels, Zalathel needed to appoint one of his generals to lead the way, as he himself was indispensable in Colthage.\n\nThree candidates had come forward, although sadly both of his brothers had passed up the job. First to apply was Bezelshazzar Zerutra, ever looking to increase his own influence. It was no secret that the zebra was an addict, but he could lead a fight. If given enough incentive, Bezelshazzar would pacify Coltva, but Zalathel worried about increasing the sly general's power.\n\nThe second applicant was Jebzel Zoblos, whose distaste for the Coltvan people was well known. This zebra would do whatever was within her power to crush the rebels. But she had a one-track mind, and Zalathel feared that the general might pass up opportunities to undermine the rebellion in different ways than brute force. The final candidate was Ziliad Annizalid, a general who sympathised with the constitutionalist faction. By all accounts Ziliad was a decent zebra, and his mild manners might help legitimise Colthaginian rule and make Zeirutid seem as the ruthless party. However, Zalathel feared the general might try to advance his own faction in Coltva, replacing one problem for another. After weighing the candidates for a while longer, the Sufrit decided to name as Commander of the East... "

 colthage_coltvan.2.t:0 "Bezelshazzar Imposes Martial Law In Coltva"
 colthage_coltvan.2.d:0 "Couriers and criers spread the news through the towns of Coltva: General Bezelshazzar Zerutra had arrived with a fresh contingent of troops and a mandate from the Sufrit to restore order. His first order of business was to impose martial law. Several of the protections of the Colthaginian Constitution would be suspended in Coltva and more powers granted to the military over local police and military. Aiding the rebels in any way, such as providing directions, lodgings or supplies, would be criminal and was subject to trial by military tribunal.\n\nThe news had a chilling effect on the Coltvans, with many of the zebra on the fence about the Zeirutids deciding to withdraw support. Another proclamation the general had spread was even more surprising to the Coltvans. Bezelshazzar intended to make his new headquarters in the Metzudah quarter of Kizil-Zeb, the historical centre of the town. This was a bold move and many zebras considered this a direct challenge to Zeshmunazash. Abandon his influence in the city and suffer a propaganda defeat, or fight, with Colthage still having the upper hoof in soldiers and materiel and risk losing it all.\n\nFor now, Kizil-Zeb's usual garrison was still in place, a light enough detachment to allow the Zeirutids free roam of the city, as Bezelshazzar secured other strategic locations first, intend on giving the rebels time to respond to his challenge. The Colthaginians played their first move, and Coltva held its breath to see if Zeirutid would let himself be caught off-guard."
 colthage_coltvan.2.a:0 "General Zerutra, you are a bold one."
 
 colthage_coltvan.3.t:0 "The Kizil-Zeb Gambit"
 colthage_coltvan.3.d:0 "Commander of the East Bezelshazzar Zerutra looked out over the city of Kizil-Zeb from his headquarters, positioned on a hill outside the city. His troops had split up into multiple columns, preparing to move into the city from different angles. The start of the operation would not be much trouble, with the modern outskirts of the city consisting of broad straight lanes with clear avenues of attack. The real problem would be the Metzudah quarter, the hilltop which once housed a fort from which the ancient Colthaginian trading post of Kizil-Zeb grew. The streets were windy and narrow, with the buildings crammed against each other in a tight maze.\n\nBut general Zerutra knew that it was not the layout of the city which made this operation so peculiar. As he peered through his binoculars, he spied for any sign of enemy movement in the city below, but he could not pierce through the tight inner-city alleys. The real difficulty of this operation was his lack of knowledge of the enemy's intention. If they had left the city open, then the challenge would be to ascertain that without having to ransack every building in the city. If not, Bezelshazzar would only find out when his troops would be stuck in close quarters fighting, denying him the use of his artillery. Of course, Bezelshazzar had full confidence in his professional soldiers in a pitched battle.\n\nThe general smirked, as he had the rebels right where he wanted them. Either they trapped themselves in a siege, or they fled, showing they were nothing more than frightened peasants. Satisfied with himself, he retreated into his tent, closing the flap and taking out his favourite spirit-expanding substance. He grimaced as his eyes lit up in anticipation." 
 colthage_coltvan.3.a:0 "Time to spice up the thrill of victory!"
 
 colthage_coltvan.4.t:0 "Bezelshazzar's Triumph"
 colthage_coltvan.4.d:0 "A few hours after he retreated into his tent, his adjutant pulled a dazed general Zerutra out of his tent and into his open roofed car. As the vehicle drove into Kizil-Zeb, his aide tried to explain the events of the day to his superior. The rebels had fled, and except for a few close calls with nervous soldiers and scared civilians, the city had been taken without incident. Although Bezelshazzar's eyes barely showed a hint of acknowledgement, his mouth curled into a sheepish smirk. What followed was a hastily arranged parade through the Metzudah quarter, with the citizens of the city watching their 'conqueror' transition from an almost catatonic state to pretending to be a God in his motorcade, slowly back to normal at the end of the day. Bezelshazzar's troops, already well aware of their general's inclinations, tried to ignore the embarrassment as best they could.\n\nHowever, little changed. Bezelshazzar's troops now had the unenviable task of keeping a tight watch over his new headquarters, with the city still being an refuge for rebels, while Zeirutid had his hooves free, able to strike wherever he wished from his hideouts in the mountains. Furthermore, any propaganda effect the Colthaginians had hoped to gain from the capture of the city was nullified by Bezelshazzar's absurd behaviour during the parade. Word of the debacle had even reached back to Colthage itself, with the Sufrit writing an angry letter to his general, demanding some sort of success, although The Commander of the East did not seem fazed by Zarca's threats.\n\nThe general would leave the occupation to his aides, while he locked himself in his office, devising new plans to break the Cotlvan resistance. And behind closed doors, he often chose to forget about it all..."
 colthage_coltvan.4.a:0 "Colthage can't afford many more victories like this one."

 colthage_coltvan.5.t:0 "A Cache of Booze"
 colthage_coltvan.5.d:0 "The Commander of the East, general Bezelshazzar Zerutra, sat on a chair on the balcony of his headquarters in Kizil-Zeb, looking at the bunch of papers he had received a day ago, and then out over the city, and then back over the papers again. He sighed and took a sip of water. No alcohol, no drugs, not even a pipe. Not on the day that everything hung in the balance. In front of him lay terms given to Bezelshazzar by Zeshmunazash Zeirutid. The rebel leader had them smuggled into the compound with a booze delivery, his signed letter politely hoping that peace could give more pleasure than even the stiff drinks. On a personal note, Zeirutid thanked the Colthaginian for taking over Kizil-Zeb without bloodshed, and mentioned how Colthaginian soldiers often acted more justly than the police officers they were assisting.\n\nThe terms themselves, Bezelshazzar had to admit, were reasonable. Though worded with the skills of a seasoned negotiator, the terms were plain and without the ambiguous language which treaties were usually known for. However cunning his adversary was, he was not underhoofed. Colthage would retain sovereignty over Coltva, but the locals would be allowed a great deal of autonomy. The general had never been much of a farmer, but the papers spoke in passionate words about a land reform plan Zeirutid wished to implement, which would allow all Coltvans to take care of themselves.\n\nSo now the unenviable decision was up to Bezelshazzar. Would he accept these terms, and defend his compromise with the rebels he was sent to root out to the Senate and the Sufrit? Or would he keep fighting these tenacious farmers? If he chose the latter, Zeirutid's letter plainly recommended him to save the alcohol for the Colthaginian wounded."
 colthage_coltvan.5.a:0 "I will accept the terms, a toast to peace!"
 colthage_coltvan.5.b:0 "I will not risk my career for these farmers, Colthage will have order."

 colthage_coltvan.6.t:0 "The Price of Peace"
 colthage_coltvan.6.d:0 "The august halls of the Colthaginian Senate were busier than usual, as the scandal of the Commander of the East reached its conclusion. On the speaker's stand stood general Zerutra, surrounded by  stone benches full of ill-humoured senators. Bezelshazzar recognised several senior officers amongst them, and when they noticed him looking, he was met by angry gazes. The murmuring died down as the eldest senator, president of the Senate by ancient precedent, tapped his staff on the ground and motioned for Bezelshazzar to speak.\n\n"Honoured senators, Colthaginians, I come bearing the gift of peace, yet my name is used in these halls as if I were her killer." Accusations of treason and addiction already started flying towards the general from the officers and their militarist supporters. In the following hour, Bezelshazzar spoke to a tumultuous senate about land reform and regionalism, becoming an unwilling advocate for the Coltvan cause. Afterwards, the first motion passed moved for the Sufrit to appoint a new Commander of the East, a sensitive political blow questioning Zalathel Zarca's authority directly.\n\nThe stern-faced Sufrit declined his turn to speak, and after the Senate session was adjourned, met up with Bezelshazzar, flanked by two Sacred Band soldiers. "Good afternoon, general Zerutra. First of all, I regret the Senate's decision today."\n\nThe general frowned, surprised by the Sufrit's seeming mildness. "It is understandable, if anything they would have wanted the final say on the agreement, although I doubt they would have accepted."\n\n"You have to make difficult decisions in the field, Zerutra, and every soldier lost in Coltva would have been missed elsewhere." Now the general was truly baffled, did Zarca become soft? The Sufrit noticed his general's surprise and let out a rare smile. "Do not think I agree with Zeirutid's plans. He is still a traitor and will get justice in time. But Colthage cannot be divided, not now. Have a good day, general." Bezelshazzar nodded dutifully, although privately he strongly doubted if Zalathel would ever be able to get Zeirutid in front of a judge. The general shook his head when he left the Senate himself, taking a sip of some of the drink Zeirutid had sent him weeks earlier."
 colthage_coltvan.6.a:0 "It would have been a shame to put this on a wound."

 colthage_coltvan.7.t:0 "The Word Spreads"
 colthage_coltvan.7.d:0 "The mountain air was blowing through Zeshmunazash Zeirutid's mane as the zebra descended down to a village in one of the many small valleys that dotted the Coltvan hinterland. Under his hoof, the leader of the Coltvan rebellion was holding rolls of pamphlets. His compatriots, descending the steep path after him, did the same. "Careful now, I will take it personally if any of you falls and gets there before me." Zeirutid joked, his eyes focused downwards, careful with every step. There had been a lot of grumbling when the rebel leader had asked for volunteers for delivering pamphlets, as his fellow rebels all styled themselves dashing heroes instead of delivery colts. The grumbling turned into embarrassment when the rebel leader announced he'd just do it himself, after which volunteers rapidly applied.\n\nThe zebra did not stay on the streets of the village for long and hurried to a larger building where they were quickly led in by an elderly zebra mare who smiled brightly. "Zeshmunazash, in the flesh!" She would say warmly, before inspecting the stacks of papers the Coltvan rebels gratefully put down. "We will have these spread over Coltva and beyond soon enough. I wish they didn't contain such awful news..." The mare would sigh and shake her head.\n\n"Coltvans need to know what is happening. The Commander of the East has crossed the line. Any zebra who was hoping for a peaceful solution cannot look away anymore."\n\nAgain the mare would sigh. "It is simple when you bring it like that, I suppose." The mare would walk over to another room while muttering; "Now, you and your intrepid gunslingers have earned a reward for your daring actions today, what can I give you from my refrigerator?""

 colthage_coltvan.8.t:0 "On the Brink of War"
 colthage_coltvan.8.d:0 ""I come here with a simple message, my sufrit, the situation is spiralling out of control. Your appointee has only worsened the situation. Perhaps another zebra would have been a better fit."\n\nZalathel Zarca wheezed at the zebra's accusation, impatient with the governor who was twenty years his senior. This stallion, who had been in charge of Coltva until the Commander of the East arrived, was a leftover from his father's inner circle. "Governor, you ask for patience, while I have waited to act for months. You are the one who did not manage to bring back order after the yetis were driven out. I do not care at all for your military advice. Tell me about this situation properly or go back to your duties."\n\nSensing that he had little to gain from questioning the Sufrit's decisions, the governor elaborated on the Coltvans instead. "Zeirutid grows bolder by the day, encouraged by his swelling numbers. Due to, ahem..." The zebra stallion coughed politely, "Recent events, many Coltvans that were ambivalent towards us have drifted to the rebel camp. Your commander has broken what little trust the common Coltvan had left for us. Only the towns with a direct armed presence are still controlled by us and even just supplying our troops is getting expensive, as the soldiers no longer trust local suppliers."\n\nThe governor eyed at the Sufrit expectantly. He had known the reign of Zamilcar Zarca, and expected Zalathel, like his father, to come up with some sort of creative solution. The sufrit, meanwhile, nodded solemnly. "So be it, I shall dispatch new orders to the garrison and mobilise reserve forces." He then turned his attention directly to the governor. "I believe we are resigned to trot the path of war, it is the only way left to save our Republic. Prepare your staff to evacuate from Kizil-Zeb immediately if the worst should occur."\n\nThe governor frowned, "You see no other way, my sufrit?" Zalathel shook his head."

 colthage_coltvan.9.d:0 "The buzzing of mosquitoes was annoying general Zerutra. Otherwise, his little cloud was perfect. Truly the gods themselves could not even enjoy such comforts, if it wasn't for that blasted buzzing. With a rip his cloud was engulfed in light, and the buzzing turned into shouting, with the cacophony of battle audible in the distance. Bezelshazzar's adjutant rushed towards him and saluted, the rest of the general's staff waiting at the entrance. "Sir, the rebels, they are fighting back. They say Zeirutid is in the city, but we can't get to him. What do we do sir?"\n\nGeneral Zerutra took a deep breath, and he seemed to be coming back to his senses. In his head an incredible migraine started stirring, instead of on a cloud he found himself at the edge of a roaring volcano. "We must stop it, before it is too late." The commander stated with a fearful gaze, barely present.\n\nHis adjutant looked befuddled, stammering back. "I just told you, we can't reach him, we can't win like this-"\n\nBezelshazzar cut off his second, "It's all going to erupt, if we don't stop it now. We have to use everything we have..."\n\n"Everything sir?" Bezelshazzar was asked by his staffer, to which he nodded determinedly. Half an hour later, the roar of dozens of howitzers silenced the volcano and brought the general back into reality. "Holy mother Aztarte..." He muttered, running towards the sound. "Cease fire, cease fire by the gods!" The general screamed his lungs out and managed to stop the barrage mid-fire. However, the damage was done. Bezelshazzar slumped down defeated as he watched the blaze on the horizon from amidst his cannons. No zebra came to comfort him, nor did the rebels come to capture him, as they were busy fighting the firestorm engulfing the historic city centre.\n\nNews of the Battle of Kizil-Zeb soon spread, even making it to overseas papers, but the artillery barrage only galvanised Coltvan resistance. And at the next Zeirutid raid, the Colthaginians heard cries of: "Remember the Metzudah!""

 colthage_coltvan.10.t:0 "The Siege of Coltva"
 colthage_coltvan.10.d:0 "General Jebzel Zoblos arrived in Coltva at the head of a large military convoy. Once in the province, the mare had her forces disperse, with sizable groups heading for Kizil-Zeb, Coltartan, and even across the interior to Marelaka. All urban settlements would receive a sizeable influx of soldiers. At first, it seemed like the new Commander of the East merely intended to strengthen the garrison, but nothing could be further from the truth. Arriving in Kizil-Zeb at the head of her forces, Jebzel Zoblos would be quick to dash any hope of a gentle regime. She commanded her forces to set up camp, and ordered all non Coltvans to leave the city. Within hours, Colthaginian soldiers had set up checkpoints at every access road, and patrols had been set out to make sure no zebra could leave the city. Telecom-cables were cut, making communication to the outside difficult. Even sea-access was denied by a destroyer blocking the port. Meanwhile, the same scene would repeat itself around cities and towns all over Coltva.\n\nAfter the initial shock had worn off, several zebras from both in and outside Kizil-Zeb would attempt to come close to the Colthaginian perimeter, but were sent away, with warning shots if they were insistent. General Zoblos was watching with glee as she saw more and more of the city's inhabitants eye her perimeter with concern or desperation, as the realisation of what had happened sank in. Eventually, she ordered her soldiers to bring one of the braver Coltvans who had been hanging around one of the roadblocks for a while to her. The young Coltvan, barely a stallion, would look at the Colthaginian general with a contemptuous glare, held down by two of Jebzel's soldiers. "Let me go, you brutes!" The zebra demanded, struggling against the soldiers in vain while Jebzel smiled amusedly.\n\n"You Coltvans can do nothing but squirm after all..." She leaned closer, grinning widely. "Until you filthy peasants stop resisting the rule of your superiors, you and all the others in those mud huts over there will not be receiving any company, understood?"\nThe Coltvan's eyes widened and his squirming only grew more intense. "You will not get away with this, you filthy daughter of Zargon! May the Deeplord swallow you and drag Colthage down with it!"\nThe stallion's curse would just make Commander of the East chuckle. "Take it up with Zeirutid. And tell your leader it is up to him to decide if you will ever see fresh food again." Jebzel gestured towards her soldiers and they carried the young stallion away."
 colthage_coltvan.10.a:0 "They will break soon."

 colthage_coltvan.11.t:0 "Zeirutid Protests"
 colthage_coltvan.11.d:0 "Sufrit Zalathel Zarca shook his head and reread the letter on his desk, before looking up to the portrait of his father. As always, Zamilcar did not provide any advice, just a stern gaze. Zeshmunazash Zeirutid was the last zebra the Sufrit expected a letter from, not least a letter so polite, with attached photographs and reports from Colthaginian civil servants in Coltva:\n\n"Dear Zalathel,\n\nI write to you in the understanding that we both share the common decency of zebra, by which I mean a basic respect for sentient life, especially when it comes to civilians and foals. That common decency seems to not be universal, however, as your new Commander of the East has demonstrated. By besieging the cities of Coltva (which are Colthaginian cities!) she has forced the civilian population into the conflict, causing much unnecessary suffering and a lack of food. Although I oppose you politically, I believe you understand your duty as Sufrit is to defend Colthaginian citizens. Therefore, I request that you replace Jebzel Zoblos with a zebra who is not willing to endanger civilian lives. In case information about the gravity of the situation has not reached you yet, I have attached photographs and reports by your civil servants about the extent of Zoblos' crimes.\nI implore you to make the right decision.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nZeshmunazash Zeirutid"\n\nZalathel had no idea how the Coltvan even managed to send him a letter, and he could only guess the zebra's intentions. Zarca had to admit Zoblos' methods were excessive, to put it mildly. If Zeirutid was desperate enough to beg for a replacement, however, could that mean the blockades were actually working? If that was the case, perhaps this strategy might save more lives than it would cost, in the long term."
 colthage_coltvan.11.a:0 "Keep Jebzel, her methods seem to be bearing fruit."

 colthage_coltvan.12.t:0 "The Breakout"
 colthage_coltvan.12.d:0 ""Our objective tonight is simple, everyzebra." Zeirutid's calming voice was carried by short wave radio to attics and hideouts all over Kizil-Zeb, where Coltvan rebels clutched their revolvers and rifles tight while listening to their leader. "We escape the blockade and head for the mountains, where we have freedom of movement. For that we need to break this blockade. Everything depends on speed and coordination. Wait for my signal flare, then strike as one to overwhelm the enemy. We can do this; I will see you on the other side." With those words, Zeirutid cut off the transmission and loaded his flare gun and swung his rifle over his shoulder. Without a word the zebra headed outside, towards the rally point for his unit.\n\nHalf an hour later, the silence was deafening. Zeirutid's left his unit on the edge of the city, sneaking forward himself. There he was, prone in the tall grass, as close to the entrenched Colthaginians as he dared. This had to be enough time for all units to assemble. The Coltvan reached for his flare gun and aimed towards the sky. The flare set of a cascade of action. Coltvan battle cries came from behind him and confused shouts from the front. With unflinching focus, the rebel leader grabbed his rifle and took aim at the trenches. The ringing of his shot cut through the air; the scream of his target muffled by the cranking of the bolt. A second shot sowed confusion and fear as zebra dug for cover. More flares lit up the sky and searchlights aimed towards his comrades. Zeirutid's third shot was already drowned out by fire from all sides. His eyes lost focus as he heard the hoofsteps of his comrades' race towards the trenches. Leaping to his hooves himself, Zeirutid joined them into the fray. His hooves hit the sand of the trenches. To the left a flash illuminated a frightened young Colthaginian face. With a rushed gallop and the butt of his rifle, she falls down. Safe for now. Breathing heavily, the Coltvan looks around to see only his comrades left standing in the trench, but lights and shouting in the distant indicated Jebzel' forces would soon come to plug the hole. Zeirutid again grabs his flare gun, the second flare signalling to the Coltvans it was time to scatter."

 colthage_coltvan.13.d:0 ""Finally, Zarishat Zeirutid. We found her last night in a Kizil-Zeb attic after the breakout, ma'am." The soldier pointed his hoof over his shoulder towards the cell door. "Although she might not be very cooperative."\nGeneral Jebzel Zoblos, grinned eagerly. "Oh, she will be forthcoming, I am sure!" The general then opened the cell door and trotted inside. The captured zebra inside looked like a mess. Her mane was ruffled and unkept, her eyes, which had big bags under them, stared at the general groggily. Jebzel sat down in front of Zeirutid. "Good afternoon, prisoner."\n\nBefore Jebzel could say more, Zarishat interrupted, her voiced drenched in irony. "Jebzel Zoblos. You have got the wrong sibling, you just missed him. Zesh is out of town."\nThe taunt managed to wipe the smile of Jebzel's face. "No, I think you are exactly who I need, Zarishat. Your brother has been quite the thorn in my side, you see."\n\n"You and me both, general." No change in tone. Now even the ever-confident Jebzel gave the Zeirutid a confused look. Was this an act? The sister seemed nothing like the brother, yet her sources told her Zarishat was with Zeshmunazash for most of the rebellion. Maybe this was just the entrance she needed. Her grin returned.\n\n"If that is so, why don't you help me get rid of this thorn? I will get you and any zebra you want out of here in no time. And you can get your home back too, if you want." Focus appeared in Zarishat's disinterested eyes, but nevertheless, the offer seemed to not phase her.\n"I'd help if I could. If Zesh had one hideout he'd have been caught already. Listen, he is way smarter than you are. If you care about your career just give up, that's my advice to you."\nJebzel started to wheeze and punched her hoof onto the table. "Who do you think you are talking to, you filthy Coltvan? I don't think you understand. If you, or any of the other prisoners related to the rebels, don't give me something, I will have you all killed!"\n\n"Thus proving my point. For every zebra you kill, you will create a small village of rebels. Murder has a way of getting zebras riled up." General Zoblos did not even hear Zarishat's final words, she already got up and left."

 colthage_coltvan.14.d:0 ""I didn't sign up for this, Za'al be my witness." Captain Pazeb took a big sip from the bottle of rum on his desk and took a pen in his hoof. "Why did it have to be me?" Also on his desk were multiple files of alleged rebels. The last few days, after new instructions from the Commander of the East, the definition of rebel widened considerably. At the same time, the burden of proof needed lowered and the sentence for any rebellious act was heightened. Death would be the only acceptable sentence. But Captain Pazeb was convinced the general did not sign these sentences herself. Surely then she would understand the stress she had put her officers under with these orders!\n\nAfter another big sip of rum, the zebra took a paper in his hoof. "Sixteen... Not even an adult. Did not show up to his landlord for work three days ago. Known slacker. Three citizens testify suspicious behaviour. Yea, yea, I'm sure some bastard was looking for a way to fire you, young stallion. Poor sod." With a flick of the pen Pazeb signed the death sentence.\n\n"Right, what have we here?" The next paper contained the details of an elderly mare. "Some sort of innkeeper? Already well above the age to retire. I don't think she can hold a rifle anymore. Let's hope no zebra will miss you. Nothing can be done."\n\nA third. A fourth. A group of six. Then Captain Pazeb lost count. Nothing can be done. Ten more? Another zebra might be worse. How big was today's stack? At least he cared. He'd say to himself. He would intervene. If it was something really bad. That's why the captain had to play along. There would be a time to make his stand. Pazeb fantasised about his heroic intervention. But surely those Coltvans would understand. Nothing can be done right now."

 colthage_coltvan.15.d:0 "The newest structure in Coltartan was a compound surrounded by electric wire on the outskirts of the town. Ramshackle guard towers were manned day and night, overseeing the prisoners inside. Every day, columns of prisoners were marched into the camp. Some were wearing suits, some poor workers' clothes. Young, old, stallion, mare. The only thing the prisoners shared was their Coltvan heritage and having been designated a 'dangerous element' by Jebzel Zoblos. The barracks the Coltvans had to sleep in were shoddily made and the beds were whatever the Colthaginian soldier could find for them. Despite his orders, newly promoted Camp Commander Pazeb worked with local farmers to get the prisoners as much food as he could. None of his subordinates protested. No soldier lifted a hoof when he arranged pickups for arrested foals. Most of the soldiers guarding the camp were silent, only speaking when communication was necessary. Then there were the few who were louder than ever. Who could not care for the judgemental looks of the others as they consumed their lust for power over the innocent.\n\nDespite following his orders in the most gentle way he could think of, Pazeb had noticed the latest afront by Jebzel had broken something among the Coltvans. For every 'danger' they'd arrest, there would be a retaliation. By now, the camp was the only safe place for Colthaginians in the entire city. He did not know how to respond. He did not have it in him to enact reprisals. The Commander did not want anything anymore. Perhaps it would be better if he went home? No. If Pazeb went home, home would be ruined as well. At least he, and the others, still had innocent memories of home. The Coltvans did not even have that. And they would have their revenge."

 colthage_coltvan.16.d:0 ""Congratulations on your promotion, commissioner." General Ziliad Annizalid smiled gently at the Coltvan, before moving over to the window of his office. "You are to be the first Coltvan police commissioner in half a century, if my notes are right."\n\nIzavel Quarzaim nodded and trotted towards the Commander of the East. "An honour I never expected, sir. One I can still scarcely believe." She pulled two cigars out of the pack in her front pocket. "But a lot of positions opened up recently. You are taking quite the risk, if I can be frank. Hah, you fired half the department! Smoke, sir?"\n\nAnnizalid smiled as he looked over the sun laden street in front of his window, but he shook his head at the mare's offer. "Colthage has no need for police officers for who the law is a means to an end, commissioner. I want this Kizil-Zeb, and all the other towns and villages in Coltva to thrive, and for that the zebras here need to be able to trust the law is on their side."\n\n"Alright." The mare put one cigar back, before lighting her own. "The governor is probably going to whine to Zarca. Along with the big landowners. But I will not mess up this shot at peace, general." The police commissioner grinned. "Makes me wonder, was the corruption just as bad over in the capital?" A trail of smoke started rising from the cigar out of the open window.\n\nAnnizalid's smile faded at the question. "The Storm King left our institutions in tatters and opportunists took advantage." He sighed and looked down at the medal on his uniform. "The rot goes deep. But for now, let us focus on what is within our reach, commissioner Quarzaim."\n\nIzavel took another puff from her cigar. "Za'al defends the just, general. Your actions will not be in vain. You've given me more hope in a week than I have had since I joined the force. Don't forget to keep some for yourself.""

One of the soldiers in Captain Pazeb's office, in the Coltartan army barracks was making excuses for their behaviour.\nWith a smile, the captain took the bottle the soldier gifted him. "I can't fault you for your taste private, but our foraging trips are over now, general's orders. So you better treat every Coltvan as if they are the Sufrit's mother from now on."\n"Old Zarca's wife is still kicking?" One of the other soldiers asked defiantly.\n"Yes, corporal, and we are going to pay her a visit. When you are there, you can explain why we took all her rum. Now move out soldiers."\n\nThe trio of looters saluted and then followed the captain out, with the alcohol they had acquired. Captain Pazeb marched unflinchingly to Coltartan, the soldiers behind him getting ever more embarrassed at the stares the locals were giving them. Pazeb made sure to parade the trio the long way around to the liquor store. Looking inside, the captain saw the clerk jump behind the counter when she saw uniforms. He knocked softly, raising his voice. "Good evening miss, we have come to return some goods. Could we come in?" Without waiting for an answer, the Colthaginian opened the door and the four entered the store. One shelf was laying on the floor, pieces of glass bottles scattered about the store. "This is what breaking nothing is, huh?" Pazeb muttered before trotting to the counter and putting his bottle on the counter, along with the coins to pay for it. "I apologise for the mess, ma'am, on behalf of the military."\n\n The zebra behind the counter cautiously raised her head. "Huh? Are you, are you serious?" The officer's warm smile and the shy looks of the soldiers behind him convinced the clerk before Pazeb ever could. "Yes, the ones who vandalised the store! That must have been a month's worth of damage."\n\n"I see how it is. " The army captain pondered for a moment before smirking, grabbing the rum he bought and turning to face his zebras. "You are staying here tonight to clean up the damage. And then you are helping this clerk every evening until she reckons you made it up to her." He glared at the soldiers. "And if I catch any of you with alcohol for the next month, you're peeling potatoes until your hooves fall off. Are we understood?""

 colthage_coltvan.18.d:0 ""My sufrit, I am sorry for the interruption, but could you spare a moment?" Zalathel Zarca looked surprised at the young officer who just came storming up to him in the Senate hallway. However, he was not the zebra to say no to some attention.\n\n"Very well, lieutenant, report."\nThe zebra mare took a second to catch her breath, before giving the sufrit a sealed envelope. "A dispatch from our agents in Coltva, sir. There is a change in political activity."\n\nZarca smiled, shaking his head as he broke the seal. "I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you did not need to gallop all this way to tell me the rebellion is losing strength." He unfolded the paper. "Although it never hurts to be the bringer of good news."\n\nThe mare started shuffling on the spot a bit, her eyes looking at the dispatch nervously and her beating heart wishing she had been more clear to the highest ranking commander in the country. Meanwhile the sufrit's smile soured as he scanned the paper. Commander of the East Annizalid had managed to lower support for the main Coltvan rebel group; the Liberation Army of the East, this has come at a cost. Many former rebel sympathisers have started openly supporting the Constitutionalist faction of Zarca's one-time challenger Zanno Mzelqatid. This may be due to the general's own influence. When he finished reading, the sufrit's gaze, now annoyed, fell back upon the mare. "I see." Was Zalathel's only curt comment.\n\nThe zebra in front of him was furiously hoping Za'al would grant her the power to sink into the floor and disappear, but the lack of divine intervention made her ask; "What are you going to do now, sir?""

 colthage_coltvan.19.d:0 ""Mister Bodazthart will see you now, mister Zarca."  The waitress tilted her head subtly towards the backroom door. The Gilded Arabian was an upper-class Ladies & Gentlecolts' Club, a den for the old money to strengthen their networks and do business. Zalathel Zarca stood up from his chair and trotted towards the backroom, where one stallion was waiting. Zaalshillek Bodazthart embodied old money. A grey mane and a gentlecolt's moustache adorned him, and the stifling smoke from his Cyanolisian cigar made the air moody. "Mister Zarca, thank you for coming on such short notice."\n"It is my pleasure mister Bodazthart." Zalathel lied through his teeth, sitting himself down in front of the landowners' unofficial leader. Few zebras could make the sufrit cancel his business to meet them, but Zaalshillek was one of them.\n\nMuch to Zarca's annoyance, the next 30 minutes were spent on pleasantries, smoking and a few drinks. Zarca spent the time imagining himself arresting the old-fashioned zebra, but he knew full well he could not antagonise his most supportive faction. Finally, Bodazthart cleared his throat, and pragmatism seeped into his overly familial tone. "Now then, Zalathel, I did not call you here merely to talk about my kids and the farm." He put out his third griffonian cigar on the ashtray. "My friends in Coltva have been telling me your new appointment has been interfering with their business. They are telling me this may have an influence on their ability to donate to your cause, unless the interference would be removed, of course."\n\nIt took Zalathel Zarca all of his willpower to keep calm during Bodazthart's command disguised as concern. "Mister Bodazthart, general Annizalid tells me he is merely making sure labour laws are being followed. If your friends hadn't treated Coltvans as glorified slaves-"\nBodazthart interrupted, his tone still as sweet as before; "My friends are helping Coltvans see the virtue of hard work. I am merely relaying my friends' concerns about mister Annizalid as a courtesy to you, and to your father. As always, the decision is yours, and I will respect it either way." He smiled and briefly looked at the door, signifying the conversation was over. Zarca briefly nodded and then left the club, heading straight for his office, wondering yet again if he should replace his commander."

"That gate was fixed since we came by here last week. Let's check it out." The captain and his driver got out of their vehicle, trotting into the property, with the corporal holding on to his rifle. Pazeb pointed towards a small barn. "Remember? That was nailed shut, now the door is open." The two zebras got close and then entered the wooden building, looking around. Both froze when they heard the distinctive sound of an Ochzor revolver being cocked.\n\n "Who's there?" A young stallion's voice said from behind a haybale.\n"I am Captain Pazeb of the Colthaginian Army, on patrol. Now come out friend, we were just having a look around." Pazeb said calmly, as the corporal aimed his rifle at the hay. After a sigh, the Coltvan emerged from behind the hay, revolver still drawn at the two others. "Army huh, I was afraid you were with the Liberation Army." He nods at the corporal and both put their guns down. "What brings you here, captain?"\n"Just patrolling, and I couldn't help but notice this farm looks lived in again. Was the rebel life not for you, my friend?" Pazeb smiled, "Don't worry, we're not here to catch the other side's deserters."\n\nThe Coltvan farmer gave a brief chuckle. "Guess you could say that. After I heard about the new police, and your commander standing up to the landowners, the old farm started calling to me." The stallion smirked. "Picked up my folks from Coltartan as well, they told me the captain there is a good zebra."\n\nPazeb shook his head. "All that work and I still get aimed at. Either way, good luck with restoring your farm.""

 colthage_coltvan.21.d:0 "Zeshmunazash Zeirutid looked out over the small valley in the center of Coltva. Even this place, so far removed from the patrols of the Colthaginian troops, was becoming unsafe for him. General Ziliad Annizalid, constitutionalist and Zarca's surprising pick for Commander of the East, had managed to dwindle support for the Liberation Army. And he had done it without compromising on the structure of the Coltvan economy. Much to Zeirutid's disappointment, a change in tone was enough to convince many peasants to lay down their arms. Although the rebel leader had applauded the changes Annizalid did propose, including actually enforcing the rights of Coltvans towards the landed class, the Colthaginian was not willing to, or perhaps, not able to, break the power of the landowners.\n\nRain started falling, but the zebra was too proud to go inside for now, standing defiant against the weather. Zeirutid was not the only one, of course, who was still defiant. But he had to be reasonable. Despite some support from the remaining hardliners, it would be amoral and unfruitful to continue the fight without support from the populace. "One good zebra is all it takes to protect the worst ones," he lamented. Zeshmunazash grabbed his rifle and held it firmly in his hooves. His mane started to hang low due to the water. But perhaps it was the weather which returned Zeirutid's resolve to him. "Perhaps his conscious will call him to us at some point. Or to move against Zarca. And then the wound will be exposed again." The Coltvan turned around and grinned to himself. "I could not ignite the uprising today, but that does not mean there is no fuel for the fire." Finally the rebel leader headed inside, shaking his mane clean."

Only before the Storm King's rampage had the streets been so lively on a normal day. Children were playing, and elderly zebra were sitting on benches in front of their homes instead of glaring at the street from behind curtains. With the police and the military now friendly, and the Liberation Army disintegrating, the people regained control of the street. Coltva Square too had become the bustling hub it was meant to be. Some zebras even took the time to fix up the fountain, which now made for a nice place for the young zebras to hang out. The cafés and restaurants around the square were inviting her in, but the commissioner had one specific place to go.\n\n"Ah, commissioner, I hope you will forgive me for changing the place where we meet for today. The weather simply demanded it."\nGeneral Annizalid said when Quarzaim approached and sat down. "Not at all, Commander, I think you deserve to enjoy the fruits of your labour." She smiled genuinely; Kizil-Zeb had been peaceful for weeks now. Instead of rebel plots Quarzaim now investigated thefts and bar brawls.\n"Come now commissioner, the Coltvans did this themselves. I just reached out my hoof. They had no reason to trust me, but they took the chance." Quarzaim's retort was stopped by the waiter asking for their order, and soon both zebras were enjoying a coffee.\n\n"But I wanted to ask, Ziliad." The two had moved to a first name basis for a while now, despite Quarzaim's initial reservations. "What about Zeirutid?"\n"Nowhere to be found. He did leave a note on my desk, however."\nThe commissioner raised her eyebrow. "What did it say?"\n"He said he had to stop fighting for now, but that I was not addressing structural flaws in our system." Annizalid smiled.

He believes so strongly in his cause, he thinks eventually every zebra would see things his way." The Sufrit kept the responses which came to mind to himself, instead nodding. "Perhaps, I suppose it would not hurt to try. What about Bezelshazzar, is he on board as well?"\n"Oh, trust me, he would do anything to further his standing. Don't worry about that."\n\nNow Zalathel really started worrying about his company. When his father was in charge, all these zebras seemed a lot less self-serving. It must have been because it was his father who was the target of their schemes. "Very well, you have my permission, but return his body to Coltva after you are done."\nNow Jebzel looked surprised. "Why in Za'al's name would we do that, they'd all worship his corpse."\n"Dead zebras can't lead. None of them can claim his legacy if he looms between them. Except a family member, perhaps, but from what I know none of them are among the ringleaders."\n"As you wish, my sufrit." Jebzel grinned. "Thinking one step ahead, just like your father."

One of Zeirutid's bodyguards remarked, eyeing the surrounding jungle suspiciously.\n"Did you not meet me on the outskirts of Maneake, in the dead of night?" As usual, Zeirutid's witty response cleared the tension from the air. "I am convinced of his intentions. Having recognized our strength, he wants to work together with us to overthrow the Zarcas. In return, we will get what we desire." Zeirutid approached the cabin and knocked on the heavy metal door, which gave a peculiar sound. "We have arrived, general." He said, after which he stood back and patiently waited.\n\nZeshmunazash's patience ran thin when he heard the sound of a radio switching on, and then some murmuring. A few more seconds passed and there was some rustling in the woods behind the group. "Hello?" Zeirutid asked with another knock, before his voice got overpowered by the sound of a machine gun letting loose upon the Coltvans. With the reflexes of an Abyssinian, Zeirutid leaped behind the corner of the cabin to safety and then quickly grabbed his rifle.\n"Ambush!" The rebel leader shouted over the screams of his comrades, as his guards did their best to find cover and return fire. Rifle-fire now mixed with the constant hail of machine-fed bullets, as it became clear the cabin was surrounded by enemies. Zeirutid filtered out the screams of his comrades and aimed towards the shadows and flashes, before taking a shot. The silenced machine gun was one success. Another shot, one less enemy soldier. A third one, but then a pain in his hind leg forced the Coltvan on his knees. Still the rebel fired a shot. Then another flash of agony in his back. Zeirutid's vision blurred, and focused again on his comrades dying on the ground in front of him. "Not. Yet." The zebra growled, and managed to grab a grenade, throwing it towards the woods. Surprised screams ahead gave him hope. An opening. Zeirutid willed on his body, struggling forwards.\n\nZeirutid almost made it to the wood line, his eyes fixated on the trees. But then his chest exploded with impossible pain, and the world tumbled. His rifle fell to the ground, and the zebra's thoughts turned to home. Finally, Zeshmunazash Zeirutid closed his eyes."

As was tradition, the cemetery in Kizil-Zeb was located on the opposite end of a small stream from the city, and the funerary stelae stood like grim ghosts in the starry night. The road to the burial ground was lit by rows of torches and surrounded by a crowd of onlookers. As the procession carrying Zeirutid's body passed, many Coltvans weeped openly. The Liberation Army's top general, Zenarvo Ozid, one of the ones carrying the coffin, wore his saddened heart on his sleeve. Also in attendance were Ahirom Zadadid, Zammo Jazelid and rebel hardliner Zanuzel Zala.\n\nAfter the invited guests went inside the small temple of Za'al, the rest of the crowd started enjoying a meal beneath the starry sky, sitting around the freshly dug grave and its large stele. Inside, the guests were greeted by an embarrassed priest and a drunk, boisterous Zarishat Zeirutid, the sister of the former Coltvan leader. As tradition required, the next step was the mrz, the ritual meal. As the rebels consumed the temple wine and the local fruits, the priest sang a eulogy for the deceased. Many in attendance lost their appetite as they were reminded of the person they had lost, not just a leader, but a loving, gentle zebra. This respectful sadness was only broken by the scrunching and burping of Zarishat.\n\nZala, sitting next to Ozid, whispered to him, while patting his back supportively. "They need a new leader, Zenarvo. It should be you, not her."\nThe general shook his head, clearly beside himself. "He is irreplaceable. I cannot replace his place in our hearts. Only she could, if..."\n"Look at her, if only the people knew." Zala replied, but before they could continue the guests stood up for the final part of the ritual. All the zebras took their plates with them, throwing them into the pit outside. Then, surrounded by utter silence, Zeshmunazash was lowered into his final resting place and buried next to the largest stele of them all. No zebra, not even Zarishat, made a sound as the grave was filled. Alongside Zeirutid, lay the dreams of the Liberation Army."

"Did you grab your lunch Zari?"\n"Stop calling me that! But yes!" Zesh smiled, he picked up his tea as he heard Zarishat crunching on a taco upstairs. Grabbing his tea and turron, he sat down at the table and opened the paper.\n\nThe headline caught him off guard, 'Sufrit Zarca promises further educational reforms, suggests removing barriers of entry for nation's largest universities.'\nZesh continued reading, the article listing other changes the Sufrit had made in recent years.

He had travelled to the island of Scarlet in Sicameon to continue his work of excavating the remains of the town. Early reports say that he was found having been beaten, strangled, shot, and stabbed with his own pickaxe. Local authorities have yet to bring forth any suspects, but the Sicameonese authorities assured us that they are treating the matter with utmost urgency.\n\nColthage's ancient history in Griffonia has always been controversial to many griffons, who reject the idea of any substantial Zebrican civilization on their continent, or even deny any meaningful interactions between our two worlds in the past. This flies in the face of contemporary evidence that Professor Balazar Zatid and many others in both Colthage and Griffonia have uncovered, along with historical accounts and events, such as the famed Karthinian General Gripio Zebricanus who conquered the island of Scarlet for the Karthinian Republic over 1500 years ago.\n\nThe professor's death has sparked outcry and mourning across Colthage. Protests have already started in the universities and there are many in the Senate who are calling for a firm response to such a crime."

 colthage_sicameon_murder.3.d:0 "As expected, the Colthaginian ambassador in Midoria has openly and officially asked for an apology from our country in regards to the murder of Professor Zatid. Our ambassador notes that newspapers in the Zebrican nation have been printing inflammatory editorials, accusing the Scarlet islanders and griffons in general of denying their history and of racial supremacy. Naturally our government doesn't support such notions, but the Colthaginian government has taken the opportunity to look tough towards their own people with both claws. Or both hooves, to be more apt.\n\nEither way, the ball is now in our park. There is no easy solution here, as our investigators have not found any evidence or even any suspects and delaying a response to the ambassador would only escalate tensions further. We could give an apology for something we had no claw in and lose face towards our own people, but put the case to rest, or take a stand against Colthage's demands and risk putting fuel on the fire of protests overseas, perhaps forcing Colthage to take more drastic actions."

The Sicameonese government proposed a government allowance for the victim's family and a plaque to be placed at the crime scene commemorating the professor's contributions to understanding of our shared histories.\n\nIt seems this generous gesture has calmed tensions across the country, and the press has already started speculating about closer trade ties and a new appreciation of the shared history between griffons and zebras."

Despite this stunning display of incompetence, they refuse to assume any responsibility for Zatid's death, and have rejected our reasonable demands of compensation out of hoof: a show of blatant disrespect toward the professor's contributions to understanding of our shared histories.\n\nIt seems this provocative gesture has inflamed tensions across the country, leading to an explosion of anti-griffon sentiment in the press. The diplomatic breach caused by this incident will take some time to heal."

These protests have very quickly morphed into protests directed against the Zarcid government. Many have latched onto a ridiculous conspiracy theory that because Balazar criticized the government prior to his departure, that he was in fact assassinated by Colthaginian agents. Believers in this theory therefore blame Zalathel for his death.\n\nIn major cities, the protesters have attacked government buildings and are demanding political reform and for an end to the Zarcid administration. However, local police forces have been able to quell the unrest in most places, although the underlying issue remains. Until things die down, we can use this as an opportunity to hunt down dissenters and lock them away before they have a chance to stir up any more trouble in the future."

"So what do we have on Zanno Mzelqatid and the constitutionalists?"\n"No problem at all, Zalathel. I summarised all the information we have at the moment." Zasdrubal retrieved a clipboard from his saddlebag and gave it to the Sufrit, whose eyes scanned the report. "It seems the conspiracy has festered in every institution. The military, the bureaucracy, and even among criminals."\n\n"Especially in the West, Zal." Zago cut in, despite the serious subject, his voice was warm and he seemed hardly concerned. "Smugglers run the border between Hippogriff Zumidia and the states of Tefemanei and Sivmareas."\nZalathel sighed, "Here I thought we had dealt with Zanno in the election. The citizens of Colthage rejected his lies, now he thinks they want him back?"\nZago grimaced, threading carefully with his impatient brother. "Mzelqatid claims that our family has destroyed the old Republic. This makes his supporters a mix of nostalgic romantics and radical students. And he knows we can't touch him as long as he hides in Annaza across the border."\n\n"Zasdrubal," Zalathel tried to contain the anger welling up in his core. "Prepare options for reinforcing the western garrisons. Zago, I want you to investigate who Zanno's supporters are and what his plan is."\nThe two Zarca brothers nodded. "And one last thing. No word about this to Zaphod." Zasdrubal and Zago looked a bit uneasy at the exclusion of their sister, but they left the Sufrit's office without protest."

Both zebras gazed over, the sun's rays illuminating a solitary figure standing at the opposite end. He seemed to wave to his supporters on the other side, and casually trotted towards them. "Wait for it, we make sure he is far enough in. I won't let the bastard slip away." Xanza commanded as quiet as she could muster.

"So good to see you here, in Colthage itself. Tell me; how are we doing?"

You are surrounded, do not resist!"\nAs if to enforce the point, dozens of rifles emerged from windows and doors, pointing at the conspirators on the street.

Although there is more you must know." The shadowy figure waited for the Sufrit to give him his full attention, relishing the moment of superiority where he knew and the most powerful zebra in Colthage did not. "The student protests were coordinated centrally. We expect that the ringleaders planned to protest the moment they would have an excuse to do so, all across Colthage. It is possible one of your enemies may have sought to weaken your rule. In time for a triumphant return, perhaps?"\nThe suggestion lingered in the air for a moment before Zalathel responded. "Zanno. Of course. No doubt funded by those arrogant half breeds in Aris!"\n\n"Perhaps, perhaps not. Although further investigation would be needed. The sort which the police would not be allowed to handle." Zalathel grimaced at the thought. It was better that he did not know what Zannid did. For a moment he wondered if his father ever asked.\n"Alright, do it." The Sufrit's determined answer did not stir the cloaked figure.\n"I must mention, that we will have to make considerable expenses. There are a hundred and twenty-seven pairs of eyes to avoid, after all." Zannid referenced the ancient judicial institution of the Republic, ever-watchful for foul play. This made Zalathel hesitate.

Zalathel looked up at the shadowy figure, who he imagined must be grinning under his hood.\n\n"How did you get all this, Zannid, this is incredible."\nIf the illusive zebra was gloating, he managed to hide it well. "Zargon, the Dark One, demands I do not share my secrets."\nWas Zannid just being esoteric for the sake of it, or did he really worship the dreaded Lord of the Deep? Either way, his answer was enough to stop Zalathel from prying. "With this we should be able to root out the constitutionalist conspiracy."

His compatriots were staring at the haphazardly barricaded door from behind desks and other cover. The zebra loaded his gun as a loud knock made the door shake in its hinges. "Remember what you are fighting for, Colthaginians!" The bureaucrat spoke loudly. "Today we defend the constitution! Today we fight for our Republic! Death to Zarca!" Wood splinters filled the room as the door broke down and police stormed through. The first zebra in barely set hoof inside before being ridden with bullets, but the police quickly responded with smoke grenades and gunfire of their own.\n\nPolice sergeant Xanza grinned. The Constitutionalist rebels were better armed than they had suspected. The zebra reloaded her Garcano-Ochzor, but then a scream next to her made the sergeant look to the side, where the chief of police collapsed. With a jump and a duck, Xanza sat next to him. "Let's get you out of here sir." Xanza pressed the chief's hoof against the wound.\n"Negative Xanza, don't let these bandits escape for my sake." Her superior coughed up blood, his voice wavering.\n"Screw that-" Xanza's retort was cut short by fire erupting in the building, making her stand back up. What in the Deep were they doing? Then the officer saw a dozen galloping shadows advance at her. Were they charging? The rest of the squad seemed as stunned as her. "Gun them down, now! Don't let them close into melee!" Xanza fired her rifle at the constitutionalists to enforce her order. It was enough to snap her colleagues out of it, and the rebels dropped one by one. She ordered a zebra to get the fire department, while the rest investigated the bodies.\n\nWith her heart still racing from the fight, Xanza looked back down at her chief, but it was too late. His eyes were closed and his body was still. She cursed and cursed until another officer snapped her out of it. "Zerdin is here, sergeant. Looks like they were out of ammo.

As such, he and many other Zarcids entered into surrender negotiations, peacefully handing themselves over to us in a symbolic end to their leadership.

Let us get rid of the whole rotten structure in one kick!”\n“If we reject, senator Zaranzid,” Zanno replied, his heart burdened by the thought, “many more innocents will perish.”\n\nZanno’s words hung heavy in the air, and the silence was only broken by Mzelqatid himself; “furthermore, their demands seem reasonable. Both the military and the scientifid clique have a place in our Colthage, do they not? We fight to bring Colthage back to normal.”\n“Many risked their lives for real change. Though they may have been there before the Zarcids, those two groups exemplify what the people despise of our elite. They run counter to our Republican ideals!” Zaranzid retorted, earning murmurs of approval from some others in the crowd.\n“More importantly than ideals, however. I worry about deceit. Zakbar and Zaryes are cunning, and they only act out of their own interests. Their coup is a shaky foundation for our Republic.” Orzagid added. “Another opportunity to stop the fighting, I would have taken, but not this.” Zanno stared down at the letter, considering the words of those around him. Should he really deny a chance for peace?"

On the other hoof, those of a more pragmatic and skeptical mindset see the new government as merely a fresh coat of paint for the old regime, that will at best still actively oppress the Coltvan people despite the democratic reforms, and at worst, be a repeat of the Zarcid regime cloaking themselves in a banner of liberty and democracy. Still, no attempt at reconciliation or peace negotiations have been made on behalf of the Constitutionalists, and former Zarcid soldiers on our front have now found themselves under new command.

I will not stand for accusations of tyranny, when we all remember life under yeti occupation!" Murmurs of approval went through the senate. "The tyrant did not vanish. We drove him out.

Behind him a bronze statue, decorated with silver and gemstones depicting a sailing ship was carried by dozens of sacred band soldiers. The procession was ended by a band.\n\nAlthough the Zonician pantheon had six main gods, Zalathel was not seeking the favour of Dark Zargon who rules beneath the waves, lawbringer Zam or warring Aztarte. The once he courted were, naturally, Za'al, 'Lord', creator of zebra, who has a form as a King, Za'al Zarakin, and an unpredictable form as God of storms, Za'al Zephon.

 colthage_other.30.d:0 "Zalathel Zarca was sitting behind his desk in the sufrit's office. Next to him stood his brother Zasdrubal, in military uniform as always. Sitting on the other side was the Hipponean diplomat Hiram Zerranid. The latter had just returned from a diplomatic mission to the Stormlands, to demand war reparations from the yeti. The diplomat was finishing off the summary of his trip. "Valuable ties have been with yeti diplomats and officials, but unfortunately, the yeti did not seem to want to acquiesce to our demands." Hiram's first assertion was half-true at best, but a diplomat should never report a total failure.\nZalathel had been frowning for most of the report, anger building at the blatant disrespect of those barbarians. "Those yetis do not take us seriously! I will show them what happens to those who insult Colthage's might. General, prepare your soldiers for embarkation immediately. Have Zaphod prepare a strike squadron."\n\nNow it was Zasdrubal's turn to frown. He would only give a slight smile to his brother's anger, while Hiram watched on with great interest. "Zalathel, I agree that the yetis' insolence demands a response, but we do not have a feasible response in our arsenal right now. Supplying a campaign in a hostile land across the continent will demand too much of our logistics. With our capabilities stretched, our enemies would seize the opportunity to steal even more of Zonicia from us."\nMuch to the Hipponean's surprise, Zasdrubal's reasonable argument had calmed Zalathel down. When it came to dealing with the sufrit, none were more adept than his siblings. The elder Zarca spoke; "You are right, of course. We cannot forsake our duty to the Republic. We shall get our funds another way. I shall speak with Zahummid about a loan instead.""

 colthage_other.31.d:0 "The Zarca siblings had come to Zago Zarca's estate in the countryside and were enjoying the end of a hot day from under the shade of a pavilion behind the mansion. Zalathel and Zaphod were standing over the table, looking over paperwork, while Zasdrubal was observing the slaves working in the field with a keen eye and the master of the house was reclining on the sofa. "So, what do you think Zal? The senators are quite excited, except for the oldest fossils, of course." Zago asked, before taking a sip from his wine.\n"It does not sit right me, honestly." Zalathel responded. "Father cemented the power of the centralists, that's how he secured our power."\nOut in the field, the overseer threatened the whip on a slave slacking off, which caused him to scurry back to his position. Zasdrubal nodded sagely at the affair, while Zaphod cringed at the sound of the cracking whip. The general spoke deliberately. "Your slaves work efficiently Zago, you must be proud."\n"They are grateful and hardworking, I am proud of the household indeed."\n"Then I do not understand your desire to federalise the Republic. Without a strong Zarcid grip, this estate would flounder, is it not the same for Colthage?"\n\nIt took a while before Zago responded. "We are talking about civilised people. A leader knows who he must control, and who he can trust to govern themselves."\nZaphod sighed. "I can't believe you see your slaves like that. Do you even talk to them?"\n"Naturally, they are always grateful." Zago smiled widely.\n"Of course they are. Either way, we might lose some control with this, Zal, but it is not the sort of control we need. Father's reforms led to the unrest in Coltva and in the west. Pass these concessions, and you show that you are a sufrit of all Zonicians, not just those in Colthage and Zur."\n"But if I reject them, we can finish father's work and start reaping the benefits." Zalathel sat down, still considering the proposal.\n"Let us have dinner first, and wine! All homegrown. We can't be all business, all day!" Zago raised his hoof, signalling to one of his slaves that it was time to bring the food."

 colthage_other.32.t:0 "The Role Of The Air Force"
 colthage_other.32.d:0 "The prospect of creating an aviation combat force has ignited a fierce debate within the military as to how this new service should be organized. Most generals agree that the natural application of combat aircraft, and therefore the aviation arm of our military, is to act in support of ground forces. They believe flying units should be placed under the operational control of Army commanders so that they can cooperate and effectively support our troops.\n\nOn the other hoof, many admirals argue that given the importance of sea power with respect to regaining Colthage's naval supremacy, it is logical to place the Air Force under the authority of the Navy. Close integration would lead to maximum efficiency for our naval aviation forces. Most of all, they emphasise the potential of air power in coastal defense, insisting that it would take only a small number of planes to sink massive enemy battleships.\n\nOpposed to both of these views, a group of visionary generals and admirals argue that if placed under the hoof of a separate branch, we risk stifling the development of the Air Force. They believe that air power has to be autonomous and controlled by zebras who understand the new technology, new tactics, new strategies, and who will not waste precious air assets trying to assist old-fashioned armies and navies. In their view, our aerial warfare branch must be given autonomy to expand and grow efficiently, free from outside meddling.\n\nThe question lies before us: what kind of Air Force does Colthage need?"

Although devastated by the Storm King's invasion in recent years, at this point they seem to have fully recovered.\n\nSigning the treaty would fully open up Colthaginian markets to us, giving us access to valuable goods such as coffee, pearls, porcelain, ivory, and sugar, to name just a few. However, it also might result in economic disruption for us in the short term, and increased interdependence with Colthage in the longer term. Shall we accept their proposal?"

Some commercial stations in foreign countries have a head start, they might seek to buy their way into influencing our country." Zalathel responded, looking longingly to the hilltop.\nZaphod, who was panting a bit from the climb interjected. "We could have been having a nice cruise today, I vote we never let Zas decide what to do again!" This prompted a triumphant smirk from Zasdrubal and nods of agreement from the other two. "I have to agree with you this time, Zalathel," the admiral continued. "I do not think we know the power of the mass media just yet, and we should definitely ban foreign companies. But this is also a way for us to get information from the people, without a sycophantic filter."\n\nZasdrubal had sprinted off while Zaphod spoke and was standing triumphantly at the top. "Come on, the view of the city is fantastic!" A minute later the others caught up, resting underneath an old tree as Zasdrubal gave them all water. "I have to admit, this is really beyond me. I can see Zal's side, but you are also right Zaph, there is value in giving the common zebras an outlet."\nZago finished his water and shook his head at the view. "From here Colthage looks so serene. You'd never tell how much damage the Storm King caused."\n"There can be value in not seeing everything, I suppose." Zalathel sighed and sat back. "Maybe I'll allow you to keep meetup planning privileges, Zas."\nZasdrubal pointed to the continuation of the trail. "Just ahead is a grove of Zanit.

The owner of several estates was considered a leading proponent of the interests of the landowners.\n"I suppose Zago tipped you off?" Zalathel frowned. "Although I did not imagine your interests included matters of the judiciary, mister Bodazthart."\nThe rural magnate smiled warmly. "Quite the contrary, my friends and I consider the One Hundred and Twenty Seven a critical institution for Colthage's continued stability and prosperity." Zaalshillek lit up a cigar, which Zalathel saw as a sign of nervousness.\n"They are critical indeed, and their independence is hurting this country. Now that the people follow me, it is time we reign in the court. I will not let any zebra stand in my way, especially not those meddlesome lawyers."\n\nZaalshillek's smile faded. "I see you are a zebra set in his ways, Zalathel, quite unlike your father. But I can offer you an alternative. My friends and I have connections." Zalathel leaned forward, interested. "There is no need to make an enemy of a potential friend. Would it not be fortunate if some constitutationalist senators were prosecuted? If they appeared as corrupt as they claim you are?" A bit of his smile returned. "You are considering it, aren't you?"\nZalathel smirked. This offer showed how much the landowners were willing to bend to remain in his good graces. Bodazthart was right where he wanted him. "I do admit, there are more important targets than the Tribunal still at large. The thing is, I just do not like any zebra to think they are untouchable, that power might get to their head." The magnate's face tensed up as he waited to hear the sufrit's decision."

Wise senators and diligent sufrits ruled, while the constitution was guarded by the One Hundred and Twenty-seven. However, the poison of corruption has taken hold of the family which now rules our country, and claims to be their saviour. Zalathel Zarca sees the constitution as an obstruction, democracy as a waste of time and the law as a suggestion. I stood against him in the election after our country was liberated, but when it seemed the people would reject him, Zarca chose to sully the election and rig it, rather than risk his power. I was forced into exile, but I have never abandoned the Republic in my heart, and neither should you.\n\nFIGHT FOR LIBERTY! GUARD THE CONSTITUTION!\n\nSpread this plan in secret and prepare for August first, 1007 of the Equestrian calendar. Connect with all those who wish for freedom, be they student, soldier, worker or slave. Arm yourself with knowledge and weapons both. Whenever possible, travel to the west, where our movement is strongest. Our platform is the restoration of democracy and the rule of law, as set forth by the constitution of 838. After the despot is removed, we shall hold fair elections for Sufrit and Popular Assembly, as well as reshuffle the Senate. The press shall be free. Labour shall be free.

 colthage_other.79.d:0 "Abstract:\nThe striped black-and-white colourization of a zebra's coat makes it difficult to discern what the 'primary' colour is. At first glance, it might appear that the 'base' colour is white and that the black stripes are 'secondary', or vice versa. The fact that a fully shaved zebra with no fur is black does not answer this question, as it is related to the coat, not the skin. The goal of this experiment is to discover the 'primary' or 'default' colour of fur by inhibiting melanin production.\nProcedure:\nThe test subject, a healthy 32-year-old female zebra was administered mercury salts over a long enough time period to cause a visible reduction in melanin production.\nAnalysis:\nWith reduced melanin, the test subject's fur turned whiter as the black stripes faded. White stripes therefore represent the absence of melanin. This proves that zebras have white fur with black stripes.\nConclusions:\nFurther study could focus on learning the evolutionary purpose of stripes, to explain why they exist in the first place. In addition, the mechanism that causes melanocytes to cease melanin production in a stripe pattern is worth investigating as well."

It was not a caravan of merchants, but a 'scientific expedition', whatever that means. There were old zebras with amusingly large moustaches escorted by stern soldiers. They set up camp near the settlement of Azir and appeared to investigate the nearby ruins, as if they were looking for something. They continued this for many days, before suddenly packing up their tent village and leaving. They gave no explanation for their journey and spoke very little with the locals, preferring to avoid them whenever possible. It is a shame, for we could've told them much about the ruins."
 colthage_other.80.d_colthage:0 "Abstract:\nColthaginian patricians have long spoken of a rumour spread by merchants who cross the Zebhara desert. According to the rumour, monolithic ruins of dark stone can be found near the settlement of Azir. This expedition aims to investigate the source of these rumours, and potentially conduct an archaeological survey of the site if it exists.\nExpedition Review:\nIn total, around 2000 personnel attended the expedition. Vast majority of these were military or logistics personnel escorting the scientists. There were enough supplies for a two-month expedition. The expedition was launched from Colthage, heading directly south along a well known caravan route. As the expedition entered the Zebhara desert, conditions quickly worsened. While there was more than enough water, preparations for preventing afflictions such as heatstroke and sunburn proved to be insufficient. Therefore, many lives were lost during the expedition. After several weeks, Azir was reached and a base camp was established near the settlement. Ruins were soon spotted in the vicinity and further studies commenced. The ruins are clearly extremely old, as the march of time has reduced them to little more than a pile of rubble. Several excavations were made, but nothing noteworthy was found. Many photographs and other records were made for further study. The native savages caused no trouble and provided supplies for the return journey.\nConclusions:\nThe poor condition of the ruins and their difficult location means that further study is not worthwhile. Valuable experience was gained from the expedition, however. In the future, better preparations will be made for travel through harsh arid environments."

The true purpose of the symbol, shared by all zebras, has never been learned. Some theorize it to be similar to a pony's cutie mark, but this has not been scientifically proven. The goal of this experiment is to discover potential similarities between the two types of flank symbols.\nProcedure:\nA potion containing the Heart's Desire flower was prepared. When ingested by a pony, it causes the Cutie Pox disease, a magical affliction which causes numerous cutie marks to appear, giving the afflicted pony an excessive amount of special talents which can result in death or injury at worst. A cure was prepared in advance with the Seeds of Truth. The potion was then administered to a healthy 27-year-old male zebra.\nAnalysis:\nThe potion had no noticeable physical effects. The zebra was a woodworker, so he was requested to cut down trees. He proved to be far more efficient at the task than before. The Heart's Desire potion is known to cause a similar talent-enhancing effect on other creatures as well, so it is unrelated to the flank symbol.\nConclusions:\nThe experiment proves that the flank symbols of zebras are not cutie marks. However, it does not provide an explanation for their purpose. Further experimentation is required to provide additional data."

An attempt to stop the group ended up with our soldiers being fired upon and retreating. There were several hundred canoes in total, so a larger force was gathered to stop them for questioning. The foreigners however had machine guns on their boats and mowed down anyone who approached. Long-range guns were fired upon them but they proved to have little effect.\n\nOur soldiers resorted to following them at a distance and scouting their movements. They entered deep into the country, nearly unopposed, and nobody knew if this was or wasn't a raid. They travelled all the way south to the Thunder Cliffs, where they appeared to study... rivers.\n\nAfter a while, the strange group turned around and travelled downstream. We let them pass as they had caused no trouble after initial confrontations. It remains unclear what their purpose was, or from where they had even come from."
 colthage_other.82.d_colthage:0 "Abstract:\nThe Neighle river covers an extremely long distance, and is often used for traffic across the Zebhara desert. However, the source of the river remains a mystery, primarily because the headwaters lie in the homeland of the Yeti. This expedition aims to discover the source of the river despite the danger.\nExpedition Review:\nA strong military escort was prepared to defend the expedition from potential Yeti aggression. A large quantity of supplies were gathered in preparation for the long journey. First, several naval vessels embarked from Hippone, arriving in Somnambula several days later. Then the expedition embarked on Maregyptian river ferries to travel upstream as far as possible. Several cataracts were crossed. When the Great Lakes were reached, hundreds of local canoes were loaned to continue the journey. Unrest in the region led to several skirmishes which caused many deaths. Finally, the homeland of the Yeti was reached. It did not take long for the Yeti to launch probing attacks at our expedition, but they were successfully repelled. With supplies running low, the headwaters in the region were explored extensively, with every tributary examined. Finally, the primary source of the Neighle was found in the southern Thunder Cliffs. The water comes from mountain glaciers that melt in the summer, causing flooding downstream. The expedition then turned back, resupplying in the cities of Hayzebland along the way.\nConclusions:\nThe Neighle is fed by many rivers flowing from the southern mountains, so there is no single clear source. However, there was one brook that is the proposed source stream due to being the furthest away from the estuary of the Neighle."

Most interaction between zebras and cattle occurs in the countryside, and little study has been done on the subject. But with more and more citizens comparing the status of livestock to slavery (or vice versa) it is necessary to learn more about the mentality of cows and bulls.\nProcedure:\nA healthy fifteen-year-old cow named Arizona was interviewed at her home farm near Trotkat. The owner gave permission for it to be conducted. The cow spoke in a thick rural accent, so the owner acted as translator when needed.\nAnalysis:\nThe cow was asked numerous questions and the following information was learned: Cattle are intelligent, they are fully content with their situation, and they have acted as livestock for countless generations. They are used to being taken care of. In a way, they live in a symbiotic relationship, providing milk and fertilizing manure for their caretakers, and, when they die of old age, hides for leather. The cow showed no issue with lack of freedoms or rights and seemed ignorant of the concept of politics. She also appeared to be pleased with her life despite never leaving the farm. The status of livestock was willingly accepted by her.\nConclusions:\nBased on this interview, the keeping of livestock is morally justified especially if all of them share the worldview of the interviewed cow. However, further study and additional interviews are required to confirm the hypothesis."

 colthage_other.84.d:0 "Abstract:\nThe extraction of magical energy of a creature is known to be possible. When Lord Tirek attacked Equestria, he famously drained the magic of thousands of ponies. Yet this was thought to be an innate ability. The Storm King, wielding the Staff of Sacanas, proved that it is possible to extract magical energy with an external tool. Using this method of energy extraction, it might be possible to remove a zebra's magical energy and thus discover what abilities are lost without the spiral symbol.\nProcedure:\nAfter gathering information about magical crystals and the Staff of Sacanas (primarily from Equestrian sources), over a month was spent making a machine that fulfills a similar purpose. This machine was then experimentally used on a healthy 43-year-old male zebra.\nAnalysis:\nAfter several attempts the machine functioned as intended. The magical crystal within it successfully absorbed the test subject's energy, draining it entirely. The removal of magic had a severe effect on the test subject. They became weak, the pupils of their eyes faded and the spiral symbol on their flank disappeared. They were unable to stand and had to be carried to a hospital. Completion of tests to measure abilities impacted by the absence of magic was impossible for them. Their magical energy reserves are expected to recover naturally over the course of several months.\nConclusions:\nThe extraction of magic had such a strong effect on the zebra that it was impossible to say what had been lost with the disappearance of the flank symbol. In that regard, the experiment was a failure. However, it was the first successful attempt of using a machine to extract magical energy from a sapient creature."

 colthage_other.85.t:0 "Experiment Report: Magical Injection"
 colthage_other.85.d:0 "Abstract:\nWith extraction of magical energy being successful, it should be possible to simply reverse the flow and thus inject energy into a creature. The effects of such an experiment are potentially dangerous, so extensive preparations are necessary. Injecting magical energy into a zebra should, theoretically, increase the effects of the magical spiral symbol, thus making it clear to observe what those effects are.\nProcedure:\nThe same machine that was used for extraction will be used for injection, with the flow reversed. The magical crystal that was filled with energy in the previous experiment will be used again. The test subject was a healthy 37-year-old female zebra. The experiment was made in a secure environment with the presence of armed guards.\nAnalysis:\nThe test subject grew rapidly in size and began to glow with raw energy. Their muscle strength increased noticeably. No changes were seen on their flank symbol. The test subject's mental state remained stable, and they were asked to prepare a potion, despite having no prior experience of making one. The task was fulfilled successfully. The test subject also succeeded in several tests of endurance and resilience which the control group was unable to do. Within several hours the test subject's condition began to rapidly deteriorate, their skin and flesh melting unnaturally. The test subject expired before magic could be removed from their body.\nConclusions:\nThe end result was similar to the previous experiment. The effect of magic was too great and it was not clear what impact the flank symbol had, if any at all. The test did prove that zebras are unable to handle excessive amounts of magical energy. It is possible that other races, such as unicorns, centaurs or changelings, have a larger innate "power capacity". A significant amount of data related to the effects of magic was gathered, which should prove useful in the future."

 colthage_other.86.d:0 "Abstract:\nScholars from abroad have proven with empirical evidence that magical crystals grow naturally. The cause of this growth is as of yet unknown, and the effect has not been replicated in a laboratory environment. As crystals are inherently magical, the primary driving force is unlikely to be related to factors such as temperature or air pressure. This experiment will attempt to use magical energy to stimulate crystal growth.\nProcedure:\nA device similar to a magical rifle developed abroad was constructed for the purposes of the experiment. It discharges magical energy into a focused point at a slow rate. The machine will be used on a small magical crystal.\nAnalysis:\nContinued discharge of energy over a period of a week caused the crystal to grow at a relatively rapid rate, about one centimeter every three hours. Higher rates of discharge accelerated the growth, but at a critical point, the target crystal shattered.\nConclusions:\nThe experiment was successful and proved that the growth of magical crystals can be artifically stimulated with the use of fully grown crystals that are charged with magical energy. It is evidence for the theory that crystals naturally grow in places with a high density of magical energy flows. These locations are most often found underground, where crystals usually appear as well."

 colthage_other.87.d:0 "Abstract:\nMotor functions of hooves have been studied extensively and are well understood. Even without scientific study, it is possible to understand how hooves can be used to grasp objects. Prehensile appendages of other species are another matter: Hands and claws have long confounded both ponies and zebras. In this study, the functioning of these forelimbs will be examined closely.\nProcedure:\nThere were two test subjects: A healthy 25-year-old female harpy and a healthy 39-year-old male minotaur. The former utilizes claws for grasping, while the latter has hands. They were given a series of tasks to complete under close monitoring. In addition, X-ray scans of both appendages will be made.\nAnalysis:\nThe two test subjects were able to complete all tasks successfully, and in some of them they proved to be more efficient than zebras. They could grasp, hold, flip and throw various objects as well as fulfill tasks requiring high degrees of precision. There was little difference between the performance of claws and hands. The X-ray scans showed their inner structures to be somewhat similar. A significant feature shared by both were opposable "thumbs".\nConclusions:\nThe experiment provided a significant amount of data on the functioning of the prehensile appendages. It appears that the primary advantage of them are talons or fingers which can wrap around objects. Most important of these "digits" are "thumbs" which allows different types of grasping, most notably "precision grip" and "power grip". The versatility of the appendages is so significant that their form should be copied and utilized in one way or another. For example, it might be possible to construct machinery that functions in a similar manner, enabling easier completion of motor tasks requiring precision."

He mounted an archaeological expedition there and was proven to be correct. However, his work ended with his unexpected murder, and the expedition returned home. This expedition aims to conclude the excavations which were started years ago.\nExpedition Review:\nA small fleet escorted by military vessels departed the port of Hippone and sailed north to Scarlet Island. While the Sicameonese were sceptical of the military personnel accompanying the expedition, they allowed them to land and escort the scientists. The expedition then headed to the dig site, which had been preserved by the local scientific community, and proceeded with the excavation. Sicameonese griffons volunteered to help with the manual labour. After several months many ruined buildings were unearthed, along with several thousand artifacts, ranging from arrowheads to golden jewelry and coins. A full list of items is included in the appendix.\nConclusions:\nThe expedition concluded Professor Balazar Zatid's work and allows historians to form a far more complete image of Colthaginian history. The Sicameonese proved to be far more cooperative than before, and were given some of the discovered artifacts as compensation for their aid (donated items are marked in the list). The rest were brought back to Colthage, and some of them will be put on display in a public museum exhibit."

 colthage_other.98.d_no_colthage:0 "Foreigners, strange creatures who are not zebras or kirin, are an increasingly common sight in south eastern Zebrica. They are for the most part greedy griffons who yearn for treasure to fill the gaping holes in their hollow hearts.\n\nBut this time, the intruders were different.\n\nScouts reported of a large group of zebras making their way through the jungle. Yet these zebras wore griffon clothing and spoke a strange, unfamiliar language. Some of them carried weapons, while others seemed to study their surroundings closely. The scouts remained hidden, following the strangers.\n\nThey wandered in the jungle for many days, and while it was clear they did not know the way, they were slowly but surely approaching the sacred Golden Temple. When the scouts reported this, a war party was swiftly assembled to stop the trespassers. They were soon surrounded from all sides and an ambush was launched. Panic soon spread among them, and they frantically fired their guns at the foliage. After the initial shock, they reorganized to better defend themselves, so our warriors retreated.\n\nAnother ambush was going to be launched on the following day, but thankfully the intruders understood the warning and turned back. The strange zebras were then never seen again."
 colthage_other.98.d_colthage:0 "Abstract:\nIt has long been claimed that a temple made entirely out of gold can be found somewhere within the jungles of southeastern Zebrica. While it is extremely unlikely for an entire temple to be made out of pure gold, the amount of witness accounts and stories makes it possible that some kind of unusual structure does indeed exist. If this structure is magical in nature, it could explain the unusual weather patterns in the region that create a tropical climate despite it being near the Tropic of Capricorn. An expedition is necessary to verify the validity of the claims.\nExpedition Review:\nTwo routes were proposed for the expedition: An overland route and an overseas route. The latter was chosen despite its greater length, as it was safer and easier. A small fleet with military escort vessels set sail from Colthage and headed eastwards. Following the coast, the ships turned southwards as they sailed past Hindia and Kiria. After several weeks, the fleet landed at the destination and disembarked. Local griffon explorers and zebras were hired to guide the expedition through the jungle. The journey proved to be extremely perilous: Disease ravaged the expedition, and dangerous animals caused additional casualties. Nevertheless, slow and steady progress was made. But when the supposed location of the temple was near, a large warband of natives emerged from the jungle and ambushed the expedition. In the confusion, many fell. By the time order was restored, the natives were already gone. Due to the high number of casualties, the risk of another native attack and lack of potable water, it was decided that the expedition should be aborted. Everyone capable of walking turned back and headed to the ships.\nConclusions:\nThe expedition proved to be unprepared for the challenges of a tropical environment. Fatalities due to disease were especially high, and the terrain was more difficult to navigate than expected. Lack of water was another serious issue. Recommendations for future expeditions into such enviroments will be prepared. As for the temple, it was aggressively defended by local natives, so it would require an entire well-supplied army to get past them. Unfortunately, it is not logistically possible to mount such a large expedition at the present."

Only those who too curious for their own good sometimes land on the frozen shores and soon regret their life choices. Everyone else keeps their distance, and if they have no choice but to sail close to the coast, they come heavily armed with the largest cannons possible.\n\nBut now, something unusual happened.\n\nAn entire fleet of ships landed on the coast, and hundreds of striped equines disembarked. Some of them wielded weapons, while others carried strange instruments. Without much hesitation, the group started heading further inland into the frozen wastes. All this time, the dragons were watching them from afar, confused yet intrigued.\n\nThe group followed a glacial river, going upstream and headed directly south. Eventually, they entered a valley surrounded by tall cliffs. This was the perfect place for an ambush, so the dragons struck. The prey fired their weapons to no avail, only felling smaller whelps. Against elder dragons, they had no chance. Soon the entire group was dispersed and scattered, forced to flee back to their ships. All this time the dragons preyed on them and hunted down those who were not fast enough.\n\nIn the end, only one ship managed to depart. The rest were left on the shore, their crewmembers and passengers slain. The dragons celebrated their victory and scavenged whatever they could. The might of the dragons had been proven once again. Perhaps the other races would from now on avoid the island forever."
 colthage_other.99.d_colthage:0 "Abstract:\nWhile the north pole has already been reached by a scientific expedition, the same cannot be said of the south pole. Due to a large scale dragon infestation, such a feat has not yet been accomplished. Modern technology however presents an opportunity to attempt it. New weapons can pierce the scales of dragons, while improved insulation helps with survival in extremely cold temperatures. With proper preparations, it should be possible to reach the south pole despite the odds.\nExpedition Review:\nA fleet with a strong military escort was prepared. Due to the danger of the mission, most personnel in the expedition were soldiers, with only a few scientists. The fleet departed from Hippone, sailing westwards. Once it passed Abyssinia it turned southwest, following the Arabian coast, before finally turning directly south. While approaching the island of the ice dragons, several nearby ships tried to warn the expedition, telling them to turn back. These warnings were ignored. Once the island was reached, landings proceeded without problems. There were no reports of any dragon activity, so the expedition headed south as soon as it was ready to do so. A glacial river was followed as it provided the shortest and easiest route to the polar glaciers. Eventually the group reached a valley surrounded by cliffs. The soldiers were on high alert as dragons were sighted, but there was no time to prepare before the beasts launched an all out attack from all sides. Hundreds of dragons, large and small, assailed the expedition. The assumption that the guns could pierce dragon scales proved to be false, and only a few small dragons fell in the battle. The expedition was ordered to retreat back to the ships where heavy naval guns could be used, but constant attacks by dragons made this a difficult task. In the end, only 42 zebras reached a ship and managed to depart.\nConclusions:\nCasualties in the expedition ended up being extremely high due to weaponry proving to be ineffective against elder dragons. Another expedition to the south pole should not be attempted until a powerful enough weapon can be mass-produced."

Over the years, the costs of rent had steadily grown while the free zebras of the village continued to languish in poverty. Meanwhile, the landlord and her family prospered in a luxurious mansion, never lifting a hoof thanks to their slaves and servants doing all the work.\n\nThe constitutionalist revolution had brought hope to the downtrodden villagers. Word spread of imminent landreform, of a utopia where the zebras would own the land they worked on. This scared the landlord family so badly that they left the village when constitutionalist forces passed through the area. A celebration was held, and the future looked bright.\n\nThen the Ten Tragic Days occured.\n\nNow the landlord had returned with a vengeance, accompanied by Zerutra's armed lackeys. She demanded all unpaid rent to be paid within a week, with interest. The free zebras were suddenly on the verge of debt bondage. Some considered suicide while a few escaped into the hills, never to be seen again.\n\nOnly a day before the deadline for rent payment, a group of strange zebras appeared on the outskirts of the village. They appeared like bandits, and many villagers thought this was the final blow to end their miserable lives. But as the bandits galloped into the village, they left the peasants alone, and headed straight for the mansion. The landlord's guards opened fire, so the bandits spread out and surrounded the building. They shot back and stormed the building. After a brief but fierce firefight, the entire landlord family was brought before the villagers in chains, and all the slaves were set free. The bandits also brought out all the valuables and foodstuffs in the manor, taking a small share and giving away the rest.\n\nThe joyous but confused villagers asked the leader of the bandits who he was.

 POLITICS_ZALATHEL_ZARCA_DESC:0 "As the son of Zamilcar Zarca, former head of the powerful Zarca family and longest serving Sufrit of Colthage, Zalathel grew up in Colthaginian high society during a period of peace and prosperity. Since his birth, he was seen as the successor of his father, and thus received far more attention than his siblings. He was educated in history, military science and politics, becoming fascinated with ancient Colthage in the process. His love for his homeland grew as rapidly as the size of his ego did. By the time he became an adult, he saw himself as the embodiment of Zonician civilization, and was ready to succeed his aging father who was preparing to retire. However, everything changed when the Storm King attacked.\n\nDespite joining his father in the defence of the city, the Storm King's forces overwhelmed the defenders. Zamilcar perished in the chaos and Zalathel was forced to abandon the city of Colthage with his sister and two brothers. The zebras fled high into the Alaudid Range to lead a guerilla force to harass the Storm King's army as it continued to rampage in Northern Zebrica. When news of the Storm King's death reached Zalathel, he led his forces to the capital and executed those who had surrendered to the enemy. With the city secure, he was seen as a liberator by many, but did not hesitate to crackdown on any opposition to the Zarcid rule. He turned to the warlords that had risen up throughout Colthage and those who would not step into line where quickly taken out.\n\nElections were soon held, which were claimed to be rigged, and the Senate approved Zalathel as the successor of his father. Now the new Sufrit, he has enough strength and support to keep power, but his position is a precarious one. Scientifids and militarists have taken advantage of the chaos, rebuilding their power. In the west, the anti-Zarcid Constitutionalist movement is plotting against his rightful rule, while in the east, the Coltvans are rising up against their landlords. Only time will tell if he is able to continue the legacy of his father, the position he was groomed for, or if the house of cards collapses around him."
 POLITICS_ZANNO_MZELQATID_DESC:0 "Zanno Mzelqatid is a son of a landowning well-off family in Western Colthage. He attended university in Wingbardy thanks to a government exchange program and there he became part of the ever growing urban middle class that read republican Griffonian literature and spoke out against the Zarcid regimen as an affront to Colthage's own republican traditions.\n\nIn 1006, when the chaos of the Storm King's invasion was dying down, Zanno travelled around the nation gathering support from the citizenry to campaign for an end of Zarcid tyranny and promised them true political and economic reform. All that had to be done was for them to make their voices heard to the Senate. Unfortunately this led to Zanno being arrested a week before the senate voted Zarathal Zarca in as Sufrit. Zanno was eventually released from prison on bail, but managed to make his way across the border into the Hippogriff-run Zumidian Mandate where he declared the election as illegitimate and began gathering supporters.\n\nPersonally, he is often seen as aloof and often not in touch with reality. In Wingbardy he ended up becoming an advocate of Spiritism and believes he is a medium who can talk to the dead and magical spirits. He claims the spirit of his dead brother visited him and asked him to dedicate his life to helping others, and to never drink alcohol or smoke. He is also a strong believer in homeopathy, a system of alternative medicine denounced by practitioners of both healing magic and medical science. Regardless, he is well liked by people he meets and is held in high regard by the employees of his plantations. He introduced sweeping education, medical, and social reforms for the plantation and the nearby towns, building schools and hospitals (staffed by actual doctors thankfully). He is against slavery and the semi-official class system in the nation and wishes to see a true liberal democratic Colthage."
 CTH_baltazar_zakbar_desc:0 "While the Scientific Clique has no formal leadership, Baltazar Zakbar is widely acknowledged as the political figurehead of the faction. He supported the Zarcids from the very beginning, primarily because of Zamilcar's efforts to modernize the country which aligned with the goals of the Scientifids.\n\nHaving studied law and economics extensively and even worked as a teacher at the University of Colthage, Baltazar is an economic mastermind who was credited with laying the foundations for Colthage's economic miracle in the 900s. It was he who balanced the budget, established a gold standard for the zhekel and signed lucrative commercial treaties with Wingbardy and Sicameon. Without his genius, Colthage would've remained as backwards as many other zebra countries. However, his reforms came at the expense of the common folk, who lost much of their land and wealth to mighty magnates.\n\nBaltazar's influence was so great that Zamilcar grew worried. Shortly before the Storm King's invasion, he sent the economist far away to Griffonia to negotiate a loan, wanting to get him out of the picture. This move likely saved Baltazar's life, as he was on another continent when flames of chaos engulfed Colthage.\n\nAfter returning to his home, Baltazar was quick to assert dominance once again. His relations with the Zarcids had soured, especially because he saw Zalathel as nothing more than a selfish, hot-headed youth. The only thing that kept him from trying to take over the country was General Batrun Zaryes, who deeply distrusted Colthaginian intellectuals. It was clear to him that more preparations needed to be made before the Scientifids could assert dominance and guarantee order and progress in Colthage."
 CTH_batrun_zaryes_desc:0 "If there was one zebra who could've challenged Zamilcar Zarca head-on, it was Batrun Zaryes. He was a military stallion who rose through the ranks during Zamilcar's reign, thanks to the Sufrit's patronage. Eventually Zamilcar gave him a position in the government, and Batrun quickly proved to be a capable administrator as well.\n\nHe used the opportunity to build up his power base, forging alliances with other generals, earning the popularity of the commoners and building his personal army. His power grew quickly, much to the dismay of the Scientifids. They were concerned and advised Zamilcar to turn on Batrun. The old Sufrit saw the general's growing influence as a threat to his regime and agreed to do so: He disbanded Batrun' personal army and arrested many of his supporters.\n\nSome years later, Zamilcar perished during the Storm King's invasion. Batrun re-established his army to fight off the invaders and reluctantly worked together with Zamilcar's eldest son, Zalathel Zarca. Thus he was able to take advantage of the chaos and rebuild his diminished power base. After the restoration of peace and order, Batrun stood as the second most powerful zebra in Colthage.\n\nBatrun is a counterweight to the Scientifids, and is very popular both among soldiers and citizens. Over the years, he earned the personal loyalty of many generals and admirals and in practice is the true head of the military. He opposed the state-directed economic policies of Zamilcar and is a proponent of free economy and business interests. It is clear that he has aspirations to "save" Colthage, so anyone who opposes him must tread carefully. They must remember that in the end, true political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."
 CTH_zebra_rarity_desc:0 "Jezabzella's patrician parents had a very clear future planned for her when she was a filly. As a scion of the immensely wealthy Zeshmid dynasty, her destiny was to continue the family's legacy by embracing the life of a merchant and marrying some zebra from another equally wealthy (preferably even wealthier) patrician family.\n\nHowever, she has bucked traditions since the beginning, and defied her parents' will. She studied foreign literature and took up political writing, had a knack for causing embarrassment for those who courted her which earned her the nickname "Lady Oleander", and most annoying of all, she joined the constitutionalists (which was a horrid disgrace to her father, who was loyal to the Zarcas).\n\nHaving studied political science from across the world, she's keenly up to date with global political discource. She also has a fascination with the harmonic society of Equestria and is an admirer of Princess Twilight and her friends. This eventually led her to establish the harmonite faction within the constitutionalists, which quickly grew in popularity.\n\nNo matter the occasion, she usually dresses up as if she's going to the ball. In part this is because she adores high fashion and dressing up, but she also loves it when others underestimate her. If they are against the common zebra getting rights and dignity, it is clear that they are not good individuals, so she doesn't feel bad about crushing them like ants."
 CTH_zenut_zaranzid_desc:0 "Zenut Zaranzid has much in common with the late Zanno Mzelqatid. He, too, comes from a landowner dynasty from western Colthage, and was influenced by liberal ideas during his studies. He also grew disillusioned with Zamilcar's authoritarianism, although he did not openly oppose the Zarcids. But this is where the similarities end.\n\nDuring Zamilcar's reign, there was a small uprising in the west. Zamilcar dispatched Batrun Zaryes to put it down. It was during this expedition that Zenut met him. Zenut negotiated on behalf of the rebels and managed to convince Batrun that their revolt was justified. Together, the two convinced Zamilcar to accept the demands of the rebels. Thus began an unusual friendship between a soldier and a politician.\n\nZenut used his ties with Batrun to his advantage, becoming a Senator in the Colthaginian Senate. He, too, opposed the Scientifids despite supporting some of their policies. However, when Zamilcar turned against Batrun, Zenut had no choice but to find another ally. This ally was Zanno Mzelqatid, the head of the Constitutionalist movement.\n\nAfter Zamilcar's death, Zenut joined the anti-Zarcid movement, which was the right choice as the rebellion succeeded and Zalathel was overthrown. But Zanno did not listen to his advice about cracking down on Zarcid supporters. This proved to be a fatal mistake when the Ten Tragic Days occurred.\n\nZenut was not surprised by the coup, and initially even supported Zaryes. But his old friend died in the chaos, and when Bezelshazzar Zerutra rose to power, he knew something had to be done to oppose him. He declared himself in rebellion of the coup and filled the void left by Zanno. However, he would prove to be a very different leader than him, in both good and bad ways..."
 CTH_bezelshazzar_zerutra_desc:0 "Born in an impoverished rural village in Trotkat, Bezelshazzar Zerutra saw a military career as the only way to escape the poverty of his home. He did his best to learn how to read, immersing himself in books about great historical figures, which allowed him to become the personal secretary of a general. With his hoof in the door, Bezelshazzar could begin to climb the ladder of military hierarchy. He entered a cadet school, earned a commission and was soon promoted to captain. Under Zamilcar Zarca's rule, he led numerous "pacification campaigns" into rebellious regions such as Coltva and distinguished himself as a capable leader. He earned a reputation of always paying his soldiers, sometimes employing ruthless methods to acquire the funds needed.\n\nNumerous brutal operations to crush rebellions took a toll on the zebra, and he soon developed a dependency on alcohol. At the same time however, he was promoted to the rank of general, joining the upper echelons of Colthage's military. But this was not enough for him. The stories he had read as a colt, about larger-than-life heroes, instilled in him a desire to make his mark on history. He now dreamed of becoming Sufrit, hoping to succeed Zamilcar once he died.\n\nSoon the Zarca did die, but nothing went as expected. Colthage erupted into chaos, and the weakened central government was barely restored by Zamilcar's offspring. There was little Bezelshazzar could do besides help with crushing rebellions as always. After the dust settled, it was clear he wasn't the only one vying for power. But the competition and chaos only made him more determined. One day, he would become Sufrit, and he would make things right."
 CTH_zannido_zidon_desc:0 "To some, he is Zannido Zidon, a ruthless bandit who takes what he wants. To many others however, he is Bandolier, hero of the common folk who steals from the rich and gives to the poor.\n\nLittle is known about Zannido's early life. He grew up on a large farm estate near Zur as the son of a sharecropper and learned to read at a local temple. He was nothing more than an average peasant, until the fateful day when the rich owner of his home estate harassed his sister. Zidon killed the zebra, saving his sister but becoming an outlaw in the process. Left with no choice but to flee, he escaped to the hills where he joined a notorious group of bandits to survive. Eventually he was arrested by Zamilcar's Rural Guard, avoiding a death sentence thanks to previously selling stolen goods to a general and instead being conscripted into the army. Not long after, he killed his commanding officer and deserted, returning to banditry. It was around this time when he earned the infamous nickname "Bandolier".\n\nNow it appeared that the average peasant had become an average bandit, stealing from others to survive. But his life changed again when he met a supporter of Mzelqatid, who convinced him that he could utilize banditry to fight back against the cruel landowners and help the common zebras of Colthage. He pledged his loyalty to the revolution, proving to be an excellent and cunning strategist, rising quickly through the ranks of the Constitutionalist army and rallying followers to his cause. The revolutionaries who have a patrician background see Zidon as little more than a criminal who cannot be trusted, but he has become legendary among the commoners, who see him as their hero."
 CTH_BATNOAM_ZARZA_DESC:0 "Born to a middle class Coltvan landowner, Zarza spent his entire early life trying to escape the condition of his Coltvan birth. His father had tried for years to earn the respect given to any Colthaginian of his status, but he was looked down upon as nothing more than a country hick. Zarza would continue his father's objective by doing all the dirty deeds asked of him by the local Colthaginian government, eventually earning a reputation as a ruthless, and mildly competent fixer. He enrolled in a local military academy and received an officer's commission thanks to his work as a grunt, and a decently sized bribe.\n\nThe one time Zarza made use of his Coltvan heritage was when the Storm King invaded Colthage. He met up with general Zoblos and they hid in the jungles of the eastern province, committing horrid reprisals on Storm King and Coltvan rebel forces alike. Though it should be noted, he never won a battle he personally led.\n\nAfter tenuous peace settled in Colthage and Zalathel became Sufrit, Zarza was promoted to a general thanks to Zoblos' recommendation, despite his complete lack of competence. However, his loyalty to the Zarcids is questionable at best. He is a zebra of opportunity with a desire to always be on the winning side. Should the tide turn against the Zarcas, he will be among the first to take advantage of it. Unless, of course, he is offered a deal he cannot resist."

During this time the §GLandowners§! grew rich and powerful, and now extend strong control over their huge tracts of land.\n\nRecently two new organisations have been rising in popularity. §gConstitutionalists§! wish for a return to democratic government and an end to the Zarcas. The §PHarmonites§! go a step further, seeking to bring radical changes to the nation and rebuilding along harmonistic lines.\n\n§YLoyal factions will provide bonuses to the nation and disloyal factions will grind the nation to a halt. These bonuses or penalties increase with their power. However, powerful factions may make demands of the Sufrit, push their own agendas, or even plot against the Sufrit if they are disloyal.§!"

 CTH_SCIENTIFID_TOOLTIP:0 "The scientific clique is a group of academics who have been an influential faction since Zamilcar Zarca came to power. During his reign, they acted as technocratic advisors, reforming education and importing the industrial revolution to Colthage. The clique's members, commonly known as Scientifids, are proponents of positivist scientific politics. This means they value order and progress above all else.\n\nEach level of §YPower§! provides the following modifiers:\n2% Research Speed\n2% Production Efficiency Cap"
 CTH_MILITARY_FACTION_TOOLTIP:0 "While much of the Colthaginian army was scattered to the wind by the Storm King, the old generals from Zamilcar's time remain in charge. In the chaos following the invasion, these generals were responsible for re-establishing order in Colthage. They became warlords who rule over their forces like decadent kings. Yet they are also fiercely patriotic, ready to fight against anything that threatens Colthage. Anything.\n\nEach level of §YPower§! provides the following modifiers:\n2% Organization\n2% Surrender Limit"
 CTH_LANDOWNERS_TOOLTIP:0 "The rich landowning aristocrats of Colthage are a fairly new faction, whose wealth is tied to the powers they were given during Zamilcar's reign. Traditionally landowners have not been influential in Colthage, with the mercantile patricians dominating the nation, but things have changed. Zamilcar rewarded those loyal to him with sizeable grants of land, while Scientifids consolidated rural property into large estates. This created a new, proud class of landlords who dominate their leaseholders and slaves.\n\nEach level of §YPower§! provides the following modifiers:\n0.1 Political Power Gain\n2% Consumer Goods Factor"
 CTH_CONSTITUTIONALIST_TOOLTIP:0 "Constitutionalists have their roots in the establishment of the Colthaginian Republic almost two hundred years ago, when the ancient democratic constitution was restored and amended. But like other factions, they were formed during the reign of Zamilcar Zarca as an opposition to his dictatorial and oligarchic rule. Its members, many of whom are middle-class urbanites and patricians, seek to restore liberty and democracy to Colthage, but not necessarily bring about social and economic reforms.\n\nEach level of §YPower§! provides the following modifiers:\n10% Economy and Mobilization Law Cost"
 CTH_HARMONITES_TOOLTIP:0 "Harmonites are the youngest of all factions within Colthage and many still consider them to be a part of the constitutionalists. They are seen by some as radicals, influenced by foreign ideas from countries such as Hippogriffia and Equestria. They advocate for a welfare state where all zebras are equal. While the harmonites share the background of other constitutionalists, they have gained more popularity among the poor and downtrodden.\n\nEach level of §YPower§! provides the following modifiers:\n5% Stability Factor\n10% Trade Opinion Factor"
 CTH_LOYALTY_TOOLTIP:0 "§YFaction Loyalty§! represents a faction's relationship with the ruling government. Generally, if Loyalty drops below §Y50%§!, the Faction will become §RDisloyal§!. A loyal faction grants bonuses, while a disloyal faction gives maluses. Worst of all, a disloyal faction with high enough §YPower§! can launch a §RCoup§! to overthrow the government."
 CTH_POPULARITY_TOOLTIP:0 "§YFaction Powerbase§! represents a faction's level of influence in the nation and amount of support in the government. There are five levels of power, with higher levels providing stronger modifiers. While powerful factions can be beneficial, they can also be dangerous: A faction with §RVery High§! power will slowly lose loyalty, and a §RDisloyal§! faction can launch a §RCoup§! to overthrow the government."
