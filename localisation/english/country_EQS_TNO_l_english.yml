 EQS_TNO_chaos_in_canterlot:0 "Chaos in Canterlot"
 EQS_TNO_chaos_in_canterlot_desc:0 "The Princesses are nowhere to be found, their whereabouts known by nopony. News is already spreading fast, Canterlot and even Equestria threatening to spiral out of control if something is not done. It is now up to Princess Twilight to take leadership, and solve this problem before it is too late."
 EQS_TNO_assemble_the_elements:0 "Assemble the Elements"
 EQS_TNO_assemble_the_elements_desc:0 "The Bearers of the Elements of Harmony are national heroes, and Princess Twilight's closest friends. Their help will be invaluable in fixing Equestria's situation, and so Twilight has summoned them to Canterlot for their help and advise to rule."
 EQS_TNO_reassure_the_ponies:0 "Reassure the Ponies"
 EQS_TNO_reassure_the_ponies_desc:0 "The ponies of Equestria are terrified, unsure of the future with the diarchs gone. Princess Twilight must inspire confidence in them like Celestia did to restore order. In the name of friendship and harmony, we will go out and convince them that nothing is wrong, and that Twilight's leadership will see continued peace for Equestria."
 EQS_TNO_meet_with_the_nobles:0 "Meet with the Nobles"
 EQS_TNO_meet_with_the_nobles_desc:0 "The nobility in Canterlot may have been mostly ceremonial, but they are still important in the day-to-day running of Equestria nonetheless. They paid respect to Celestia before; Princess Twilight is sure that with a few words, she and they can see eye-to-eye as well."
 EQS_TNO_the_leaders_of_equestria:0 "The Leaders of Equestria"
 EQS_TNO_the_leaders_of_equestria_desc:0 "The mayors, the bureaucrats, the businessponies. There are many important ponies in Equestria beyond the capital, and their help is needed now more than ever. Twilight and her friends must meet with them to give them the support and the orders needed to keep Equestria alive."
 EQS_TNO_uphold_harmony:0 "Uphold Harmony"
 EQS_TNO_uphold_harmony_desc:0 "No matter what, we must make sure that Harmony is maintained in Equestria. Our principles are what make us who we are, our friendships defining what we as a country represent. Even if all else is lost, we must remain harmonious together, even if the world burns around us."
 EQS_TNO_equestria_saved:0 "Equestria Saved"
 EQS_TNO_equestria_saved_desc:0 "Under the leadership of Princess Twilight, Equestria has been saved from the chaos of the past and is ready to continue its period of stability and peace, much like the reign of Princess Celestia. Twilight is confident that they will return soon, and until then, she will act as the new crown of the nation. Long live Princess Twilight! Long live Equestria!"
 
 EQS_TNO_the_regency_begins:0 "The Regency Begins"
 EQS_TNO_the_regency_begins_desc:0 "Equestria has fallen into total war, and it is clear why. We are surrounded by traitors to harmony, to friendship, and most terrible of all, the Princesses themselves. Our holy Regent, Princess Twilight Sparkle, is now willing to do whatever it takes to destroy these false states and bring about Celestia and Luna's return... by any means necessary."
 EQS_TNO_redefining_friendship:0 "Redefining Friendship"
 EQS_TNO_redefining_friendship_desc:0 "The fact that Celestia left only means that we did not understand the true meaning of Friendship. Others do not see the truth like Twilight; they unfortunately have their own misguided visions of what Friendship looks like. The true Elements of Harmony will show us the way, and must be in their purest forms for Equestria to survive."
 EQS_TNO_honesty:0 "Honesty"
 EQS_TNO_honesty_desc:0 "Lies are the basis for the destruction of friendship. We are surrounded by lies, blinded by what we are told by others and what we tell ourself. The truth must be revealed, and be our only guide; the Regent will accept no other alternative. You will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth."
 EQS_TNO_loyalty:0 "Loyalty"
 EQS_TNO_loyalty_desc:0 "It was the absence of loyalty that caused the Princesses' absence, and the lack of it in Equestria is disgusting. Traitors and heretics have no place in the ideal new Equestria, and the Regent requires no deviation. You will swear your complete and utter loyalty to the Regent and her friends, and follow her commands without question."
 EQS_TNO_generosity:0 "Generosity"
 EQS_TNO_generosity_desc:0 "Equestria struggles to survive while some of its people still thrive on their own possessions. This is nothing but greed, and against everything Friendship should be. Generosity is giving everything you have in service of others and in particular the Regent. Your prosperity was given to you by her, and thus you must give back in return."
 EQS_TNO_laughter:0 "Laughter"
 EQS_TNO_laughter_desc:0 "Pinkie Pie is the Element Bearer of Laughter, and during her long friendship with the Regent she taught her what that means. It means to always be happy no matter the situation, to carry on and keep Friendship alive no matter how the situation seems. To always smile, to always laugh. So smile, everypony."
 EQS_TNO_kindness:0 "Kindness"
 EQS_TNO_kindness_desc:0 "Kindness is a luxury, but an important one all the same. Acts of kindness are what create and save Friendships, and it is the same thing that will save Equestria. Always be kind to your friends... and show none of it to your enemies, the treasonous subequines lurking in our midst. They do not deserve it, and they are not your friends."
 EQS_TNO_shut_the_doors:0 "Shut the Doors"
 EQS_TNO_shut_the_doors_desc:0 "It was the insidious influences from those outside of Equestria that led to its fall and the disappearance of the Princesses. No more shall we tolerate such. From now on, we will be alone, cut off from the world to be left to our own harmony, the way that things should be."
 EQS_TNO_enshrine_the_princesses:0 "Enshrine the Princesses"
 EQS_TNO_enshrine_the_princesses_desc:0 "Everything we do, we do for the Princesses. They are the guiding lights of Equestria, they were the country itself, and even without their presence we still serve and honor them. We must never let our loyalty falter; our faith must be unyielding, and our praise towards our holy leaders must never cease."
 EQS_TNO_friendship_brigades:0 "Friendship Brigades"
 EQS_TNO_friendship_brigades_desc:0 "The regular army is simply not up to the task of securing our rule. If we are to defeat our enemies and bring about the Princesses' return, we will need a larger, more disciplined force composed of soldiers who will carry out the Regent's orders without question. The Friendship Brigades shall be that force."
 EQS_TNO_everypony_in_place:0 "Everypony in Place"
 EQS_TNO_everypony_in_place_desc:0 "In a friendship, every pony has their place. There is a role for them all to play, much like the Elements of Harmony all had a role to play. And yet we let Equestria become complacent, prioritized the concept of individuality, a foolish notion. We are all one under the Regent, and where she tells you to go, you must go."
 EQS_TNO_celestial_artwork:0 "Celestial Artwork"
 EQS_TNO_celestial_artwork_desc:0 "It is not enough to just be loyal to the Princesses; we must show our devotion in not just our thoughts and deeds. Great works to the glory of the Princesses, paintings of their grace, statues of their beauty, reminders of their power must be commissioned, so we are all reminded of what we fight for, and what we must prove to regain."
 EQS_TNO_cult_of_the_crown:0 "Cult of the Crown"
 EQS_TNO_cult_of_the_crown_desc:0 "We are not worthy of her presence. We are not worthy of her grace. Not while we do not believe, while we still hold doubts or lack devotion. They may call us a cult; is that not what her majesties Celestia and Luna deserve? A portrait of them in every home, including one of the Regent will remind everypony of that fact."
 EQS_TNO_open_the_schools_of_friendship:0 "Open the Schools of Friendship"
 EQS_TNO_open_the_schools_of_friendship_desc:0 "Just as Celestia once taught the Regent in her School for Gifted Unicorns, the Regent must now teach the youth of Equestria in her new Schools of Friendship. We shall bring all schools under the direct control of the Regency and enforce a new curriculum written by the Regent herself. Our students must learn the true nature of harmony."
 EQS_TNO_rewrite_the_journal:0 "Rewrite the Journal"
 EQS_TNO_rewrite_the_journal_desc:0 "The Friendship Journal that the Regent made long ago was well-intentioned, but ultimately misguided. Twilight sees that now, sees all the mistakes she made in the past, and it is time to correct them. The journal must be rewritten, so that it can be copied and distributed as the new rules and examples to follow."
 EQS_TNO_repurpose_the_cmc:0 "Repurpose the CMC"
 EQS_TNO_repurpose_the_cmc_desc:0 "The Cutie Mark Crusaders have potential, that much is certain. At one point, they even learned under the personal mentorship of the Regent herself. But they lack purpose, and numbers. We can provide both, with mandatory membership and a duty to play in the plans of the Regency."
 EQS_TNO_magic:0 "Magic"
 EQS_TNO_magic_desc:0 "When the five Elements are together, united by the spark of friendship, only then does the sixth Element of Magic appear. That was the Regent's very first lesson long ago, during one of the holy Princesses' return. It leads the other five, and as the Princess and Element Bearer of Magic, there is no better proof of authority that our holy Regent has."
 EQS_TNO_absolute_standards:0 "Absolute Standards"
 EQS_TNO_absolute_standards_desc:0 "Everything must be nothing less than perfect for the Princesses. Everything must be in just the right place, and everypony must behave exactly as needed. There is no room for deviancy, no room for error. Perfection is not just expected, it is required. Tardiness is not an option."
 EQS_TNO_our_work_has_just_begun:0 "Our Work Has Just Begun"
 EQS_TNO_our_work_has_just_begun_desc:0 "The traitors lay broken at our hooves. Our Regency stands triumphant, society remolded as the Princesses intended. But yet they still do not return. This can only mean one thing; we have not done enough. We must take the lessons learned to heart, and go further than ever before; we can not let everything we have done been for nothing."
 EQS_TNO_the_horned_traitors:0 "The Horned Traitors"
 EQS_TNO_the_horned_traitors_desc:0 "In the Northeast a truly insidious group of traitors has risen, with ideals that run counter to even the ancient foundations of Equestria. The Unicornian Sisterhood has its aims displayed right in the name; it is dedicated to raising one pony race above the rest, when the nation was built by all three tribes. It is time to teach them a lesson in friendship."
 EQS_TNO_protracted_warfare:0 "Protracted Warfare"
 EQS_TNO_protracted_warfare_desc:0 "The war against the Sisterhood will not be an easy or a short one. The mountain ranges they hold will prove difficult to cross, and their territory is vast. We will have to settle in for a long war if we are to be victorious, or even survive against their determined onslaught."
 EQS_TNO_into_the_fold:0 "Into the Fold"
 EQS_TNO_into_the_fold_desc:0 "The ponies of Bales cried out for our liberation, for the welcoming and friendly hooves of the Regent to save them. And now that they are no longer forced to serve the Sisterhood, they are signing up in masses to serve and help us defeat them, to cast down the unicorns that once oppressed them. Grab a gun and a friend, because the war is not over yet!"
 EQS_TNO_shackle_the_unicorns:0 "Shackle the Unicorns"
 EQS_TNO_shackle_the_unicorns_desc:0 "Unicornia, a failed experiment caused by failed ponies, has fallen. The Earth Ponies and Pegasi freed of their oppression, they are not to blame for what has transpired. No, it is the unicorns who must be closely watched from now on. The leaders will be executed, and those remaining will never have the chance to betray Equestria again."
 EQS_TNO_the_false_princess:0 "The False Princess"
 EQS_TNO_the_false_princess_desc:0 "The Southwest has seen a new pony, a heretic who claims the title of Princess Platinum's descendant and direct heir. These are nothing but falsehoods, dishonesties to mislead ponies into fighting for them against our Regent. We need to deliver cold hard Honesty to them, by force."
 EQS_TNO_expose_the_lies:0 "Expose the Lies"
 EQS_TNO_expose_the_lies_desc:0 "It is not the fault of the ponies in the false Equestria that they have been lied to, fed nothing but what their 'Princess' wants them to hear, and deluded into thinking their cause is true. They deserve the truth, and we will provide it for them. When they learn their world is a lie, and that we are the ones who bring friendship, then they will change their tune towards their monarch."
 EQS_TNO_rush_them_down:0 "Rush Them Down"
 EQS_TNO_rush_them_down_desc:0 "The 'Princessdom', a fake state as it is, appears much stronger than it is. In reality they are weak, only one step away from being broken. And broken they shall be. We must be swift, and with only one quick buck the whole rotten structure will come crashing to the ground."
 EQS_TNO_burn_the_south:0 "Burn the South"
 EQS_TNO_burn_the_south_desc:0 "Upon a closer look, the issue was not just of a monarch claiming a dead throne, but of vile separatism from the Crown and the rule of the Princesses. This can not stand, will not stand under the watchful rule of the Regent. The dissidents will find no quarter or shelter, and the rugged south will once again find loyalty in service to Canterlot."
 EQS_TNO_accelerando:0 "Accelerando"
 EQS_TNO_accelerando_desc:0 "The Southeast was always a hotbed of separatism, but none of us could have expected the musical uprising that occured there, bring forth a crescendo of socialism. Still, only we can bring an end to this piece, and cause a finale to the aspirations of heathens."
 EQS_TNO_danger_of_the_jungles:0 "Danger of the Jungles"
 EQS_TNO_danger_of_the_jungles_desc:0 "The jungles are a dangerous place, filled with deadly traps and creatures for both friend and foe alike. Our Regent would know, having been on adventures there multiple times. The most important aspect in fighting there will be preparation, both for the enemy and the terrain itself. Plans, things that the Regent favors, will be crucial to our success."
 EQS_TNO_the_native_loyalists:0 "The Native Loyalists"
 EQS_TNO_the_native_loyalists_desc:0 "The natives of the Southeast are not content with just standing by as the Republic rips away every tradition they once held dear, but they have no way to fight back. They, the Neighua and the thestrals worship the sun and moon respectively, and by extension the Princesses that we do. That makes them loyal to us, and if we can only provide them the means they will rise up in support of us."
 EQS_TNO_in_with_the_old:0 "In With the Old"
 EQS_TNO_in_with_the_old_desc:0 "The Southeast requires a new, more local administration to ensure that the chaos that once enveloped it does not happen again. It is not the migrant or new Equestrians that we can rely upon, but the always-loyal and tested natives that can ensure devotion to the Princesses is absolute. Let them deal with such filth as the Baltimarian degenerates."
 EQS_TNO_the_eastern_revolution:0 "The Eastern Revolution"
 EQS_TNO_the_eastern_revolution_desc:0 "Manehattan, once a loyal part of Equestria, has fallen to revolution similar to that of Severyana long ago. This time, however, we can not stand by and let it fester anti-Princess thought. This uprising is one that will be nipped in the bud."
 EQS_TNO_break_the_illusions:0 "Break the Illusions"
 EQS_TNO_break_the_illusions_desc:0 "The UESR is filled with nothing but idealists, ponies who can't see the truth in front of their faces. They cling to impossible visions, wishing to see them become impossible realities. It's time to give them a cold dose of reality, and show them what friendship is really about."
 EQS_TNO_relentless_assault:0 "Relentless Assault"
 EQS_TNO_relentless_assault_desc:0 "We can not let ourselves be bogged down by a stale front in the East. There is no choice but to remain on the offensive, continuing our assault until there is nothing left of the traitorous communists. There will be no ceasing to our attacks, no quarter given. They will feel the full fury and might of us, with the Princesses watching over us!"
 EQS_TNO_extinguish_the_dream:0 "Extinguish the Dream"
 EQS_TNO_extinguish_the_dream_desc:0 "There will be no revolutions. There will be no more dreams of a new society, except that which the Regent brings. Such thoughts are extinguished under a new order, a new future. There will be no harsh punishment this time, but there will be a warning to all those who saw treason occur and did nothing; such acts will never be tolerated again."
 
 EQS_TNO_to_meet_the_deadline:0 "To Meet the Deadline"
 EQS_TNO_to_meet_the_deadline_desc:0 "The deadline for the Regent, and for all of Equestria looms ever closer, and yet we are still far from finished in our duties for the Princesses. To not be tardy, we must give more, become harsher and more loyal, show truer friendship than we ever have. And that will include giving that friendship to not just ourselves, but all of Equus."
 EQS_TNO_the_empire_of_snow_and_ice:0 "The Empire of Snow and Ice"
 EQS_TNO_the_empire_of_snow_and_ice_desc:0 "The Crystal Empire. The Regent and her loyal assistant personally saved it from destruction just years ago, yet now they refuse to acknowledge our rule over ponykind. Their arrogance will be their undoing; there is no pony too great to re-learn real friendship."
 EQS_TNO_the_crystal_heart:0 "The Crystal Heart"
 EQS_TNO_the_crystal_heart_desc:0 "The Crystal Heart was the very artifact that Princess Celestia, blessed be her name sent Princess Twilight to save, making it an artifact of holiness. The Crystal Ponies do not deserve to have such visible daily; it must be heavily guarded by only our most loyal friendship brigades, to prevent another King Sombra from rising forever."
 EQS_TNO_work_the_mountain_mines:0 "Work the Mountain Mines"
 EQS_TNO_work_the_mountain_mines_desc:0 "Many ponies have seen the light and embraced our rule. Many others have not. For those unfortunate souls who can not understand yet, they will find penance working in the far north of the Crystal Mines, giving the Regency what it needs one way or another."
 EQS_TNO_ponies_united:0 "Ponies United"
 EQS_TNO_ponies_united_desc:0 "Crystal Ponies and the Four Tribes were always meant to be together, no matter what others may say. We will respect their autonomy with their long struggle with the enemy of the Princesses, the terrible King Sombra, but over time they will become inseparatable with the lands of the Regency. Ponies united, together in friendship."
 EQS_TNO_children_of_the_moon:0 "Children of the Moon"
 EQS_TNO_children_of_the_moon_desc:0 "The thestrals, our loyal subjects. Their devotion to Princess Luna is unquestionable, and as we are the Regent in place of her, that means they are by extension loyal to us. They will be the shadows in the darkness, the ear that hears the voices of treachery. They will keep the Principality safe from enemies within and without."
 EQS_TNO_servants_of_the_sun:0 "Servants of the Sun"
 EQS_TNO_servants_of_the_sun_desc:0 "Before Celestia's disappearence, there remained a small group of ponies fanatically loyal to her and her sun, willing to lay down their lives in service of her. They serve the Regency now, and their devotion will not go unused. They can act not only as a militant arm of our proud forces, but also as the preachers and spreakers, filling our ponies with pride and diligence."
 EQS_TNO_redemption_through_labor:0 "Redemption Through Labor"
 EQS_TNO_redemption_through_labor_desc:0 "The crimes such as treason, heresy, and worst of all tardiness are great, but there is still a chance for redemption, for a return to friendship. The rock farms of Southern Equestria always need more labor, and there is now plenty to go around. If they can prove themselves once more, perhaps they can one day rejoin our ranks as our little ponies."
 EQS_TNO_the_original_traitors:0 "The Original Traitors"
 EQS_TNO_the_original_traitors_desc:0 "Before there was the civil war for the Regency, before there was even the return of Princess Luna, there was the creation of Stalliongrad. An insult by its mere existence to the Princesses, it willingly chose to reject their blessed leadership to run their own rotten, degenerated state. It started with them, and it ends with them."
 EQS_TNO_purge_the_revolutionaries:0 "Purge the Revolutionaries"
 EQS_TNO_purge_the_revolutionaries_desc:0 "There are few loyalists remaining in Severyana. Perhaps many just did not have the courage or loyalty to fight against the communist menace, but many were unfortunately tainted by their lies and fight us even now for twisted ideals. There is no saving them; they will only find solace in death."
 EQS_TNO_the_new_tsaritsa:0 "The New Tsaritsa"
 EQS_TNO_the_new_tsaritsa_desc:0 "The title of Tsaritsa is a defunct title, or so many had assumed. As the de facto leader of Severyana, Princess Celestia was by divine right the Tsaritsa of the region, and so the title now belongs to the Regent until her return. She does not need official legal power for her authority to be absolute, but she will use it nonetheless."
 EQS_TNO_severyana_reclaimed:0 "Severyana Reclaimed"
 EQS_TNO_severyana_reclaimed_desc:0 "There was no Stalliongrad. And there was no Our Town. Both were experiments that failed and are meant to be forgotten. There is only Equestria. There is only the Princesses. Never doubt their leadership, for they bring the ponies peace and friendship, and nopony else."
 EQS_TNO_save_the_princesses:0 "Save the Princesses"
 EQS_TNO_save_the_princesses_desc:0 "Long ago, in the Canterlot Attack of 1002, Queen Chrysalis, may her name be consigned to Tartarus for eternity, defeated the holy Princess Celestia in single combat. This was not only a terrible insult, but also proof that the Changeling race will always be a threat to ponykind and its beliefs. They must be destroyed at any cost, for the safety of the Princesses when they return."
 EQS_TNO_rescue_the_deer:0 "Rescue the Deer"
 EQS_TNO_rescue_the_deer_desc:0 "The Deer were meant to join us in Harmony, under Queen Velvet, a friend of Princess Celestia. But insidious forces destroyed that notion, placing a pretender on the throne. Olenia is too volatile to leave alone; it must be brought under our benevolent protection, and allowed to experience real harmony just as we have."
 EQS_TNO_hunt_the_queens:0 "Hunt the Queens"
 EQS_TNO_hunt_the_queens_desc:0 "The Queens of the Changeling Lands are dangeous. They can rival the power of alicorns, of Princesses, if given the chance. So they will not be given one. They must be hunted down, exterminated, thrown into graves en masse. It may not be easy, or pleasant, but ultimately it is necessary."
 EQS_TNO_bring_down_the_drones:0 "Bring Down the Drones"
 EQS_TNO_bring_down_the_drones_desc:0 "The Drones may not have ruled or have any power, but they were complicit all the same in the attack on Equestria. So, they too must be punished with wide-reaching reprisals, shown the consequences of their actions. Many may die, but it is a sacrifice the Regent is willing to make."
 EQS_TNO_aid_the_yaks:0 "Aid the Yaks"
 EQS_TNO_aid_the_yaks_desc:0 "During the learning period of Princess Twilight, the Yaks were convinced to leave their isolationism and embrace friendship. But the Jaks rejected that, wanting isolationism instead of our protection. So, we will bring it to them by force. Any real Yak will embrace us, and anyone else will be proven a traitor."
 EQS_TNO_towards_the_far_north:0 "Towards the Far North"
 EQS_TNO_towards_the_far_north_desc:0 "The Polar Bears and the Penguins. Races of cold, typically cut off from the rest of Equus. Our mandate requires their integration, so they must see service to the Regent as well. Who knows? Perhaps they will take better to friendship than we expect."
 EQS_TNO_cleanse_the_hives:0 "Cleanse the Hives"
 EQS_TNO_cleanse_the_hives_desc:0 "We have beaten them, we have broken them, yet still they resist. We are left with no other choice; the changeling race must be purged of any subequine thoughts until it is ready to integrate as friends with pony society. That day may be long off, but we are well-prepared to continue our efforts until it comes, or the last changeling falls dead at our hooves."
 EQS_TNO_those_from_beyond_equus:0 "Those From Beyond Equus"
 EQS_TNO_those_from_beyond_equus_desc:0 "The griffons do not belong on Equus. They were sent as a colonial venture, a way for the Empire beyond the seas to extend its power and meddle in our rightful affairs. That protection is long gone now, and we remain as we always have. If the griffons can learn friendship, then we will accept them. If not... we are more than willing to send them back where they came from."
 EQS_TNO_kneel_the_dragons:0 "Kneel the Dragons"
 EQS_TNO_kneel_the_dragons_desc:0 "We have had a troubled relationship with the dragons. Once enemies, turned friends. But many still antagonize us, continue to test patience we no longer possess. They will recognize the authority of the Regent above any Dragon Lord, and they will do it learning humility above all else."
 EQS_TNO_ascension:0 "Ascension"
 EQS_TNO_ascension_desc:0 "Everything is in place. Yet the Princesses are still missing. So, we will continue. Twilight has seen reality; she must do more. Accomplish more. And for that, she must ascend past who she is now. The Regent will cast off her current shackles to lead us into an even brighter age, ready to take any action for the glory of our Princesses! All Hail the Eternal Regent!"

In the smallest villages a single squad of soldiers might be the only sign of the Regent's authority.\n\nSilver Shill looked up from his produce stand to watch the two soldiers patrolling the village boundary. Although many ponies here were upset about their presence, Silver didn't mind them. They were quite harsh, but these were tough times, and what right did he have to judge their methods?

She didn't even have half that amount, but how could he say no to such a cute foal?\n"Yes, it's just enough. Here you go!"\n\nSilver smiled to himself as she ran off, apple in hoof. He didn't notice the soldiers approaching until they were right in front of him.\n\n"How much does an apple cost here?" the soldier asked, cocking her rifle.\nSilver shuddered. "4 bits."\n"And yet you told that foal she could afford one?"\n"Well... er... yes."\n"In other words, you lied."\nThe soldier said this with such malice in her voice that Silver immediately realized he was in deep trouble.\n\nAs he was taken away at gunpoint, Silver reflected on his life. He thought of his dreams of starting a business, the plans he'd laid to make it happen, and the ponies he'd met along the way. Since the most merciful fate he could hope for now was life in a labor camp, those plans were destined to remain just dreams.\n\nIn the name of Honesty, a fair merchant lost his livelihood."

He had once worn it with pride, but now it felt like a terrible weight he couldn't escape. Being a Wonderbolt used to mean being an elite flyer famous throughout Equestria, but now it meant something quite different. Instead of tricks and stunts, they practiced formation flying and airborne assaults. Rumor had it the academy students would be joining the other Wonderbolts in combat soon.\n\n"Vapor, do you ever feel like something's wrong?"\n"No," the other pegasi replied, "why would I?"\n"You should know why. When we were young, we thought becoming Wonderbolts meant helping the ponies of Equestria. Now we're serving a military with standing orders to disregard civilian casualties. Has nothing the Regent's done seemed... off to you?"\n\nVapor's face tensed up. "It's not our place to say. We swore an oath to faithfully serve Equestria and its princesses, and I intend to keep it."\n"I'm not so sure," Sky said, "I don't know how much more of this I can take."\n\nAs the pair passed by the offices of the academy's military police unit, Vapor approached the nearest MP and said, "This stallion is attempting to conspire against the Regent."\n\nSky stood in stunned silence as Vapor reported on the conversation they just had. It was only as the MP cuffed his hooves that he realized what was happening.\n\n"Vapor, how could you! You were my wingpony, my friend!"\nVapor remained silent as Sky was dragged away. A large part of her was heartbroken, but deep down she knew she made the right choice. If he persisted they both would have been found guilty of treason. After a lifetime spent lifting Sky up, she wasn't about to let him drag her down.\n\nIn the name of Loyalty, Vapor had betrayed her oldest friend."

They'd quickly looted the most recent harvest and everything left in the orchard, and now they had moved on to the house. They took furniture, kitchenware, and anything else that was even remotely valuable. He would say they'd taken everything that wasn't nailed down, but they also removed the door and several of the floorboards.\n\nThe officer overseeing the process approached Pistachio and his parents.\n\n"We thank you for your contribution to the Regent's cause. You are truly generous ponies! Times may be hard, but when Equestria is secured and Celestia returns you will regain everything you've lost and more!"\n\nPistachio gritted his teeth. He was surprised the officer could repeat such an obvious lie with a straight face. The army had stripped every farm in the region bare. There was no way these thugs were ever going to repay all of their victims. Even if compensation was coming in the distant future, just surviving until then would be a serious challenge.\n\nAs Pistachio held in his anger, he watched his parents try their best to smile and nod at the officer.

Their dark purple full dress uniforms, polished rifles and serious faces cut an intimidating figure. Each and every one of them was eager to demonstrate the iron discipline and fanatic loyalty that would soon make them infamous on the battlefield.\n\nTo many of the ponies lining the streets, the whole display seemed utterly bizarre. A parade showing off military might was the kind of thing one expected to see in the Changeling Lands, not the home of ponykind.\n\nIt was only after the parade that the real demonstration began.\n\nThe Friendship Brigades fanned out across the city, hunting down traitors, dissidents and other unreliable elements. Canterlonian nobles, many of whom were rumored to have sympathies for the Unicornian Sisterhood, saw their estates burned to the ground. The soldiers went so far as to target any ponies who had refused to attend the parade or who looked bored during it.\n\nBy dawn the next day Canterlot was a changed city. It wasn't just the mass carnage, something had changed inside the common ponies as well.

It was already almost full, but that did not faze her as she grabbed another sheet to begin another attempt at a rough draft for a new Friendship Journal, one that millions of ponies and foals would look to as the new law of Friendship. The Regent knew that she could write it; it was simply waiting for inspiration to strike as she sat quill at the ready.\n\nThe old Journal of Friendship she had made long ago was also sitting on her desk, the pages worn from use. It was the baseline for the new one, but there was still so much to change, so much to correct. She had been so ignorant back then; not seeing the bigger picture, not knowing how much more there was to friendship. But only Twilight could teach the ponies what she had learned herself, and that required words for them to folow. Perhaps classes as well; it would remove the excuse from those who did not wish to read her texts, the savages.\n\n"Loyalty is a defining trait in Friendship between ponies," Twilight said to herself as the quill danced across the paper. "True loyalty can be seen anytime in any situation, and is required for such a friendship to exist. Such loyalty, of course, must extend both ways; anypony who does not remain loyal to their friends does not deserve them or the right to exist among those better suited for it..."\n\nHours later, Twilight's work was complete.

"I didn't realize that I'd be receiving visitors today. I wonder who they are." She felt her very soul light up with the slightest shred of hope as she continued speaking to herself. "Could they be emissaries of Celestia and Luna, perhaps, to tell me that they'll be returning soon?"\n\nAnd then she noticed the uniforms they wore, the outfits of traitors and communists.

 EQS_UESR_SABLIN_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 1st of January, 985 in Princessyn (now Stalliongrad)\n\n§YBiography§! Born in Princessyn amidst the Hearth's Warming Eve celebrations of 985, Valery Stablein was only a child when his family pledged themselves to the service of Staliongrad's Winter Revolution and its legendary leader, the Marksist theorist Steel Stallion. Stablein grew up dreaming of Stallion and of the revolution, but when he arrived as a commissar under the command of Stalliongrad's army of the proletariat, the young threstral found only disappointment. Stablein dreamed of a true pan-Equestrian revolution, a foolish hope of unity, strength, and a socialist magic of friendship to all ponies no matter their tribe, but Stalliongrad, he knew, would never be the place for it.\n\nTraveling south from that degenerated workers' state, Stablein found a place for himself within the thestral rights movement. Batponies, from Manhehattan to Tenochtitlan to the sunny shores of Coltfoalnia, could only find their rights in the form of a mass popular movement, a revolutionary vanguard that neither Princess Luna or Nightmare Moon could ever provide. When the dam broke and the Princesses and their despotism departed Equestria at last, Stablein stormed a radio tower in Detrot and broadcast a message for all the east to hear. He expected none but the most faithful of his revolutionary thestral movement to listen, but they did. Stallions and mares flocked to join him, the dreamers, the dissidents, the colts and the fillies. Now, Stablein and his revolutionaries fight against all hierarchy, ready to make the ultimate sacrifice for the dream.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"
