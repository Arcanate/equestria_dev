 EQS_TNO_chaos_in_canterlot:0 "Chaos in Canterlot"
 EQS_TNO_chaos_in_canterlot_desc:0 "The Princesses are nowhere to be found, their whereabouts known by nopony. News is already spreading fast, Canterlot and even Equestria threatening to spiral out of control if something is not done. It is now up to Princess Twilight to take leadership, and solve this problem before it is too late."
 EQS_TNO_assemble_the_elements:0 "Assemble the Elements"
 EQS_TNO_assemble_the_elements_desc:0 "The Bearers of the Elements of Harmony are national heroes, and Princess Twilight's closest friends. Their help will be invaluable in fixing Equestria's situation, and so Twilight has summoned them to Canterlot for their help and advise to rule."
 EQS_TNO_reassure_the_ponies:0 "Reassure the Ponies"
 EQS_TNO_reassure_the_ponies_desc:0 "The ponies of Equestria are terrified, unsure of the future with the diarchs gone. Princess Twilight must inspire confidence in them like Celestia did to restore order. In the name of friendship and harmony, we will go out and convince them that nothing is wrong, and that Twilight's leadership will see continued peace for Equestria."
 EQS_TNO_meet_with_the_nobles:0 "Meet with the Nobles"
 EQS_TNO_meet_with_the_nobles_desc:0 "The nobility in Canterlot may have been mostly ceremonial, but they are still important in the day-to-day running of Equestria nonetheless. They paid respect to Celestia before; Princess Twilight is sure that with a few words, she and them can see eye-to-eye as well."
 EQS_TNO_the_leaders_of_equestria:0 "The Leaders of Equestria"
 EQS_TNO_the_leaders_of_equestria_desc:0 "The mayors, the bureaucrats, the businessponies. There are many important ponies in Equestria beyond the capital, and their help is needed now more than ever. Twilight and her friends must meet with them to give them the support and the orders needed to keep Equestria alive."
 EQS_TNO_uphold_harmony:0 "Uphold Harmony"
 EQS_TNO_uphold_harmony_desc:0 "No matter what, we must make sure that Harmony is maintained in Equestria. Our principles are what make us who we are, our friendships defining what we as a country represent. Even if all else is lost, we must remain harmonious together, even if the world burns around us."
 EQS_TNO_equestria_saved:0 "Equestria Saved"
 EQS_TNO_equestria_saved_desc:0 "Under the leadership of Princess Twilight, Equestria has been saved from the chaos of the past and is ready to continue its period of stability and peace, much like the reign of Princess Celestia. Twilight is confident that they will return soon, and until then, she will act as the new crown of the nation. Long live Princess Twilight! Long live Equestria!"

 EQS_UESR_SABLIN_SENTRY_TRAIT:0 "The Last Sentry"
 EQS_UESR_SABLIN_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 1st of January, 985 in Princessyn (now Petershoof)\n\n§YBiography§! Born in Princessyn amidst the Hearth's Warming Eve celebrations of 985, Valery Stablein was only a child when his family pledged themselves to the service of Staliongrad's Winter Revolution and its legendary leader, the Marksist theorist Steel Stallion. Stablein grew up dreaming of Stallion and of the revolution, but when he arrived as a commissar under the command of Stalliongrad's army of the proletariat, the young threstral found only disappointment. Stablein dreamed of a true pan-Equestrian revolution, a foolish hope of unity, strength, and a socialist magic of friendship to all ponies no matter their tribe, but Stalliongrad, he knew, would never be the place for it.\n\nTraveling south from that degenerated workers' state, Stablein found a place for himself within the thestral rights movement. Batponies, from Manhehattan to Tenochtitlan to the sunny shores of Coltfoalnia, could only find their rights in the form of a mass popular movement, a revolutionary vanguard that neither Princess Luna or Nightmare Moon could ever provide. When the dam broke and the Princesses and their despotism departed Euqestria at last, Stablein stormed a radio tower in Detrot and broadcast a message for all the east to hear. He expected none but the most faithful of his revolutionary thestral movement to listen, but they did. Stallions and mares flocked to join him, the dreamers, the dissidents, the colts and the fillies. Now, Stablein and his revolutionaries fight against all hierarchy, ready to make the ultimate sacrifice for the dream.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"
