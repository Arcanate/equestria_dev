 EQS_TNO_chaos_in_canterlot_desc:0 "The Princesses are nowhere to be found, their whereabouts known by nopony. News is already spreading fast, Canterlot and even Equestria threatening to spiral out of control if something is not done. It is now up to Princess Twilight to take leadership, and solve this problem before it is too late."
 EQS_TNO_assemble_the_elements:0 "Assemble the Elements"
 EQS_TNO_assemble_the_elements_desc:0 "The Bearers of the Elements of Harmony are national heroes, and Princess Twilight's closest friends. Their help will be invaluable in fixing Equestria's situation, and so Twilight has summoned them to Canterlot for their help and advise to rule."
 EQS_TNO_reassure_the_ponies:0 "Reassure the Ponies"
 EQS_TNO_reassure_the_ponies_desc:0 "The ponies of Equestria are terrified, unsure of the future with the diarchs gone. Princess Twilight must inspire confidence in them like Celestia did to restore order. In the name of friendship and harmony, we will go out and convince them that nothing is wrong, and that Twilight's leadership will see continued peace for Equestria."
 EQS_TNO_meet_with_the_nobles:0 "Meet with the Nobles"
 EQS_TNO_meet_with_the_nobles_desc:0 "The nobility in Canterlot may have been mostly ceremonial, but they are still important in the day-to-day running of Equestria nonetheless. They paid respect to Celestia before; Princess Twilight is sure that with a few words, she and they can see eye-to-eye as well."
 EQS_TNO_the_leaders_of_equestria:0 "The Leaders of Equestria"
 EQS_TNO_the_leaders_of_equestria_desc:0 "The mayors, the bureaucrats, the businessponies. There are many important ponies in Equestria beyond the capital, and their help is needed now more than ever. Twilight and her friends must meet with them to give them the support and the orders needed to keep Equestria alive."
 EQS_TNO_uphold_harmony:0 "Uphold Harmony"
 EQS_TNO_uphold_harmony_desc:0 "No matter what, we must make sure that Harmony is maintained in Equestria. Our principles are what make us who we are, our friendships defining what we as a country represent. Even if all else is lost, we must remain harmonious together, even if the world burns around us."
 EQS_TNO_equestria_saved:0 "Equestria Saved"
 EQS_TNO_equestria_saved_desc:0 "Under the leadership of Princess Twilight, Equestria has been saved from the chaos of the past and is ready to continue its period of stability and peace, much like the reign of Princess Celestia. Twilight is confident that they will return soon, and until then, she will act as the new crown of the nation. Long live Princess Twilight! Long live Equestria!"
 
 EQS_TNO_the_regency_begins:0 "The Regency Begins"
 EQS_TNO_the_regency_begins_desc:0 "Equestria has fallen into total war, and it is clear why. We are surrounded by traitors to harmony, to friendship, and most terrible of all, the Princesses themselves. Our holy Regent, Princess Twilight Sparkle, is now willing to do whatever it takes to destroy these false states and bring about Celestia and Luna's return... by any means necessary."
 EQS_TNO_redefining_friendship:0 "Redefining Friendship"
 EQS_TNO_redefining_friendship_desc:0 "The fact that Celestia left only means that we did not understand the true meaning of Friendship. Others do not see the truth like Twilight; they unfortunately have their own misguided visions of what Friendship looks like. The true Elements of Harmony will show us the way, and must be in their purest forms for Equestria to survive."
 EQS_TNO_honesty:0 "Honesty"
 EQS_TNO_honesty_desc:0 "Lies are the basis for the destruction of friendship. We are surrounded by lies, blinded by what we are told by others and what we tell ourself. The truth must be revealed, and be our only guide; the Regent will accept no other alternative. You will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth."
 EQS_TNO_loyalty:0 "Loyalty"
 EQS_TNO_loyalty_desc:0 "It was the absence of loyalty that caused the Princesses' absence, and the lack of it in Equestria is disgusting. Traitors and heretics have no place in the ideal new Equestria, and the Regent requires no deviation. You will swear your complete and utter loyalty to the Regent and her friends, and follow her commands without question."
 EQS_TNO_generosity:0 "Generosity"
 EQS_TNO_generosity_desc:0 "Equestria struggles to survive while some of its people still thrive on their own possessions. These is nothing but greed, and against everything Friendship should be. Generosity is giving everything you have in service of others and in particular the Regent. Your prosperity was given to you by her, and thus you must give back in return."
 EQS_TNO_laughter:0 "Laughter"
 EQS_TNO_laughter_desc:0 "Pinkie Pie is the Element Bearer of Laughter, and during her long friendship with the Regent she taught her what that means. It means to always be happy no matter the situation, to carry on and keep Friendship alive no matter how the situation seems. To always smile, to always laugh. So smile, everypony."
 EQS_TNO_kindness:0 "Kindness"
 EQS_TNO_kindness_desc:0 "Kindness is a luxury, but an important one all the same. Acts of kindness are what create and save Friendships, and it is the same thing that will save Equestria. Always be kind to your friends... and show none of it to your enemies, the treasonous subequines lurking in our midst. They do not deserve it, and they are not your friends."

If we are to defeat our enemies and bring about the Princesses' return, we will need a larger, more disciplined force composed of soldiers who will carry out the regent's orders without question. The Friendship Brigades shall be that force."

Their dark purple full dress uniforms, polished rifles and serious faces cut an intimidating figure. Each and every one of them was eager to demonstrate the iron discipline and fanatic loyalty that would soon make them infamous on the battlefield.\n\nTo many of the ponies lining the streets, the whole display seemed utterly bizarre. A parade showing off military might was the kind of thing one expected to see in the Changeling Lands, not the home of ponykind.\n\nIt was only after the parade that the real demonstration began.\n\nThe Friendship Brigades fanned out across the city, hunting down traitors, dissidents and other unreliable elements. Canterlonian nobles, many of whom were rumored to have sympathies for the Unicornian Sisterhood, saw their estates burned to the ground. The soldiers went so far as to target any ponies who had refused to attend the parade or who looked bored during it.\n\nBy dawn the next day Canterlot was a changed city. It wasn't just the mass carnage, something had changed inside the common ponies as well. They all realized that friendship now meant loyalty to the regent above all, and that the Friendship Brigades would enforce the regent's will by any means necessary."

"Good morning students. My name is Cleansing Light, and I will be your new instructor."\n\nSilver Spoon raised her hoof. "What happened to Ms. Cheerilee?"\nThe teacher moved closer and snarled. "Do not speak that name ever again, and always address me as Ms. Light. Do I make myself clear?"\n"Yes Ms. Light," Silver Spoon replied, shuddering.\n\n"Now class, can anyone tell me the best way to promote harmony?"\nAnother student in the front row raised their hoof. "Making friends with everypony you meet, right Ms. Light?"\n\n"Wrong!" the teacher shrieked, violently slamming her hooves onto the student's desk. "The only way to promote harmony is to obey the commands of Princess Celestia and her holy regent! Befriending the enemies of the Regency, the subequines that plague our lands, is a crime punishable by death!"\n\nBy this point many students were cowering under their desks. After composing herself the teacher continued, "The rot is much deeper that I thought. It appears we'll have to start over from the beginning. You will all serve the regent one day, and you must be prepared."\n\nThe students spent the rest of the day learning new definitions for words like "harmony," and "friendship." It didn't make much sense to them, but in time these lessons would start to sink in.\n\nAs the dismissal bell rang, the teacher briefly held them back.

Scootaloo thought she'd have more time to prepare her escape, but the thugs who took their name, the fake "Cutie Mark Crusaders" had shown up less than an hour after the decree was announced. She'd lost the earthponies and the unicorns hours ago, but there were still several pegasi and a thestral chasing after her.\n\nThey'd been her classmates, once. Foals just like her. What had gotten into them? It didn't matter. The world had gone crazy and Scootaloo had to scoot. She was getting closer and closer, closer to the border of a place where, stories said, the regent couldn't reach you. Her pursuers young wings were tiring out, and so were her's, but Scootaloo was scooting for her life.\n\nA cliff! Curse these hills, there was a ravine coming up fast!  On the other side, Scootaloo saw a patrol wearing uniforms which didn't belong to the regency. She couldn't slow down: she was going too fast, and she'd rather plummet to her death than let the "CMCs" catch her. Scootaloo popped one last wheelie, and accelerated towards the edge.\n\n"Sweet moves, kid," she heard an unfamiliar voice say as she came to some two hours later, "We all thought you were a goner, but you made it."\n\nScootaloo started laughing, then she started crying, then she laughed again.

Born in Princessyn amidst the Hearth's Warming Eve celebrations of 985, Valery Stablein was only a child when his family pledged themselves to the service of Staliongrad's Winter Revolution and its legendary leader, the Marksist theorist Steel Stallion. Stablein grew up dreaming of Stallion and of the revolution, but when he arrived as a commissar under the command of Stalliongrad's army of the proletariat, the young threstral found only disappointment. Stablein dreamed of a true pan-Equestrian revolution, a foolish hope of unity, strength, and a socialist magic of friendship to all ponies no matter their tribe, but Stalliongrad, he knew, would never be the place for it.\n\nTraveling south from that degenerated workers' state, Stablein found a place for himself within the thestral rights movement. Batponies, from Manhehattan to Tenochtitlan to the sunny shores of Coltfoalnia, could only find their rights in the form of a mass popular movement, a revolutionary vanguard that neither Princess Luna or Nightmare Moon could ever provide. When the dam broke and the Princesses and their despotism departed Equestria at last, Stablein stormed a radio tower in Detrot and broadcast a message for all the east to hear. He expected none but the most faithful of his revolutionary thestral movement to listen, but they did. Stallions and mares flocked to join him, the dreamers, the dissidents, the colts and the fillies. Now, Stablein and his revolutionaries fight against all hierarchy, ready to make the ultimate sacrifice for the dream.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"
