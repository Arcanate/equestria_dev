 EQS_TNO_chaos_in_canterlot:0 "Chaos in Canterlot"
 EQS_TNO_chaos_in_canterlot_desc:0 "The Princesses are nowhere to be found, their whereabouts known by nopony. News is already spreading fast, Canterlot and even Equestria threatening to spiral out of control if something is not done. It is now up to Princess Twilight to take leadership, and solve this problem before it is too late."
 EQS_TNO_assemble_the_elements:0 "Assemble the Elements"
 EQS_TNO_assemble_the_elements_desc:0 "The Bearers of the Elements of Harmony are national heroes, and Princess Twilight's closest friends. Their help will be invaluable in fixing Equestria's situation, and so Twilight has summoned them to Canterlot for their help and advise to rule."
 EQS_TNO_reassure_the_ponies:0 "Reassure the Ponies"
 EQS_TNO_reassure_the_ponies_desc:0 "The ponies of Equestria are terrified, unsure of the future with the diarchs gone. Princess Twilight must inspire confidence in them like Celestia did to restore order. In the name of friendship and harmony, we will go out and convince them that nothing is wrong, and that Twilight's leadership will see continued peace for Equestria."
 EQS_TNO_meet_with_the_nobles:0 "Meet with the Nobles"
 EQS_TNO_meet_with_the_nobles_desc:0 "The nobility in Canterlot may have been mostly ceremonial, but they are still important in the day-to-day running of Equestria nonetheless. They paid respect to Celestia before; Princess Twilight is sure that with a few words, she and them can see eye-to-eye as well."
 EQS_TNO_the_leaders_of_equestria:0 "The Leaders of Equestria"
 EQS_TNO_the_leaders_of_equestria_desc:0 "The mayors, the bureaucrats, the businessponies. There are many important ponies in Equestria beyond the capital, and their help is needed now more than ever. Twilight and her friends must meet with them to give them the support and the orders needed to keep Equestria alive."
 EQS_TNO_uphold_harmony:0 "Uphold Harmony"
 EQS_TNO_uphold_harmony_desc:0 "No matter what, we must make sure that Harmony is maintained in Equestria. Our principles are what make us who we are, our friendships defining what we as a country represent. Even if all else is lost, we must remain harmonious together, even if the world burns around us."
 EQS_TNO_equestria_saved:0 "Equestria Saved"
 EQS_TNO_equestria_saved_desc:0 "Under the leadership of Princess Twilight, Equestria has been saved from the chaos of the past and is ready to continue its period of stability and peace, much like the reign of Princess Celestia. Twilight is confident that they will return soon, and until then, she will act as the new crown of the nation. Long live Princess Twilight! Long live Equestria!"
