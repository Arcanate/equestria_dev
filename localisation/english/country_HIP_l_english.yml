 HIP_rozenkampism:0 "Lightningism"
 HIP_rozenkampism_desc:0 "Lightningism continues all of Posada's most notorious policies at an even more intense pace. Chiropterra continues to be devastated, and resources are ruthlessly extracted from North Zebrica to fuel the post-scarcity society on the home front. Calling himself the true heir of Posadism, some fear he aims to persecute ethnic minorities within Revolutionary North Zebrica due to his nationalist roots and belief in biological lumpenproletariat. Crack insists the phenomenon of biological lumpenproletarians is based upon ethnicity and direct heritage, not race, but for the zebras and ponies within Revolutionary North Zebrica, that offers a small comfort as the nebulous "superculture" they are supposed to conform to seems quite ill-defined."

 ### FOCUS ###
 HIP_focus_tree:0 "Hippogriffia Focus Tree"

 ### NAVY FOCUSES
 HIP_continue_navy_modernisation:0 "Continue Navy Modernisation"
 HIP_continue_navy_modernisation_desc:0 "Although our navy is already one of the most powerful in the world, we cannot afford to be lax. We must ensure our navy is always ahead of the competition. As an island nation, the navy will determine whether we live or die."

 HIP_deep_blue_war_games:0 "Deep Blue War Games"
 HIP_deep_blue_war_games_desc:0 "A strong naval doctrine is essential to success. Traditionally we have favoured striking our enemies' ships when they are in ports, but we do have other doctrinal options available should we wish to change our course. No matter what, we must choose a path."

 HIP_expand_the_marine_corps:0 "Expand the Marines"
 HIP_expand_the_marine_corps_desc:0 "When we must invade other countries, it will be the marines who will lead the way, and the landing craft that will carry them to safety. Naval invasions are a nightmare, but with grit and determination we can prevail."

 HIP_freedom_ships:0 "Freedom Ships"
 HIP_freedom_ships_desc:0 "Our civilian shipping industry is invaluable to our continued development. By producing more convoys, we'll be able to trade with our friends regardless of enemy raiding. As an added bonus, readily available convoys will make naval invasions faster."

 HIP_naval_radar:0 "Shipboard Radar"
 HIP_naval_radar_desc:0 "Radar will let us spot enemy ships through the worst conditions nature can throw at us. Future models may even be able to locate submarines or calculate better firing trajectories."

 HIP_royal_shipbuilding_committee:0 "Form the Royal Shipbuilding Committee"
 HIP_royal_shipbuilding_committee_desc:0 "Our many shipbuilders are skilled but disorganized. Different styles, gun measurements, and even engine designs prevail across the country. By forming a committee to centralise administrations and establish national standards, we can drastically speed up production."

 HIP_seapony_squardrens:0 "Seapony Squadrons"
 HIP_seapony_squardrens_desc:0 "We have a long and storied history of the use of submarines. By forming dedicated squadrons of seaponies to crew them, we can quickly adapt to looming problems with design."

 HIP_underwater_supremacy:0 "Underwater Supremacy"
 HIP_underwater_supremacy_desc:0 "As a nation of seaponies, we can afford to invest even further in submarines. As our submarines don't have to carry air, we can hide like ghosts. Our submarines will strike at any troop transports and escape into the depths. No one will ever be able to take our home from us again!"

 HIP_expand_the_escort_fleet:0 "Expand the Escort Fleet"
 HIP_expand_the_escort_fleet_desc:0 "When trading with other nations, it's absolutely critical to make sure our shipments arrive safely. We lack many resources other nations enjoy, and to keep our war machine operational we must protect our trade routes. Modern destroyers will keep our convoys safe."

 HIP_battleship_primacy:0 "Battleship Primacy"
 HIP_battleship_primacy_desc:0 "The battleship is the ultimate expression of naval dominance, and the backbone of the navy. With a large enough battlefleet, no one will ever dare to attack us."

 HIP_imperious_class:0 "The Imperious Class Project"
 HIP_imperious_class_desc:0 "Our naval theorists have discussed a design for a new battleship. This proposed "super heavy battleship" will carry guns twenty-one meters long. It will no doubt be an enormous investment of resources, but when completed it will tear even the battleships of the future to shreds."

 HIP_air_sea_warfare:0 "Air-Sea Warfare"
 HIP_air_sea_warfare_desc:0 "As a people who can shift from soaring through the skies to swimming under the seas, it's only logical to focus our efforts on a navy that does the same. Pairing planes with boats will not only be a symbol of our unity, it will let us strike our enemies in their bases with ease!"

 HIP_rapid_strike_tactics:0 "Rapid Strike Tactics"
 HIP_rapid_strike_tactics_desc:0 "Our pilots will have to fly in quickly, execute their mission, and then return to the carrier to fuel up. We can accelerate this process by refuelling and reequipping in the air."

 HIP_naval_aeronautics_committee:0 "Naval Aeronautics Committee"
 HIP_naval_aeronautics_committee_desc:0 "With our new focus on carriers, we will also need to modernize our carrier planes. Forming a Naval Aeronautics Committee will help us move boldly into the future and strike any navy that dares oppose us."

 ### INDUSTRY FOCUSES
 HIP_seapony_primacy:0 "Seapony Primacy"
 HIP_seapony_primacy_desc:0 "We survived the Storm King's invasion by hiding underwater. The sea shelters us, and it must be the sea we rely upon going forward. Even with modern submarines, our enemies can't reach the sea floor, so we'll always have a safe place to flee to."

 HIP_hippogriff_primacy:0 "Hippogriff Primacy"
 HIP_hippogriff_primacy_desc:0 "We can't afford to cower in the depths any longer. The world is changing, and if we are to take our place as a preeminent nation among the peoples of the world, it's time to change too."

 HIP_expand_the_underwater_dockyards:0 "Expand the Underwater Dockyards"
 HIP_expand_the_underwater_dockyards_desc:0 "The underwater dockyards allow us to produce and repair ships away from our enemies. With a navy being repaired safe from all harm, we will be able to enjoy true naval supremacy, striking our enemies in port while our own ports are underwater."

 HIP_underwater_construction:0 "Underwater Construction"
 HIP_underwater_construction_desc:0 "Constructing buildings underwater makes them immune to strategic bombing. As long as Seaquestria stands with us, we will have an impervious industry."
 
 HIP_shell_oil:0 "Shell Oil Company"
 HIP_shell_oil_desc:0 "Although we have a reasonable amount of crude oil, it isn't enough to fuel our massive navy. We'll need to develop our oil refining process, and synthetic refineries are also worth looking into."
 
 HIP_support_the_oil_industry:0 "Support the Oil Industry"
 HIP_support_the_oil_industry_desc:0 "There's only so far we can get with improving refining. A great wealth of oil lies under the ocean floor, and we can tap into it with modern extraction. Synthetic oil has also been developed by some other countries of the world, and would help us supplant our natural reserves."

 HIP_national_road_network:0 "National Road Network"
 HIP_national_road_network_desc:0 "By constructing a nationwide road network, we can speed up all our future construction. It'll also be useful for supplying any military operations. It will move our society in favor of hippogriffs, however."

 HIP_underwater_railways:0 "Underwater Railways"
 HIP_underwater_railways_desc:0 "Building underwater rails will make future underwater construction much faster, and even help us build things on the surface should we desire to. It will move our society in favor of seaponies, however."

 HIP_public_infrastructure_works:0 "Public Infrastructure Works"
 HIP_public_infrastructure_works_desc:0 "We are a peaceful and isolationist people. It's only sensible to build better roads and bridges to improve our citizens' quality of life."

 HIP_bellbreeze_aircraft_corporation_focus:0 "Form the Bellbreeze Aircraft Corporation"
 HIP_bellbreeze_aircraft_corporation_focus_desc:0 "We are a naturally airborne people. When we fight our enemies in the skies, directing our efforts to maneuverability will let us shoot them down while dodging their attacks."

 HIP_air_industry_fund:0 "Expand Aircraft Funds"
 HIP_air_industry_fund_desc:0 "We need more fighters. They shoot down enemy bombers and escort ours to their destination. [HIP.GetLeader] has approved a special fund for fighters, using some of the royal treasury to personally cover costs."

 HIP_department_of_commerce:0 "Form the Department of Commerce"
 HIP_department_of_commerce_desc:0 "While we are a modern nation, the fact remains that as the world changes at breakneck speed, we run the risk of being left behind. If we are to safeguard our technological advantage, we need to keep advancing."

 HIP_office_of_industral_sciences:0 "Open the Office of Industrial Sciences"
 HIP_office_of_industral_sciences_desc:0 "There are so many topics we can be investigating, from machinery to electronics to battleships to our own biology. We need to open a new branch of the government dedicated exclusively to research and innovation. This Office of Industrial Sciences will ensure we are never behind our peers."

 HIP_grand_alaudia_bauxite_mine:0 "Expand Metalworking Industry"
 HIP_grand_alaudia_bauxite_mine_desc:0 "Hippogriffia is quite resource rich, but much of those resources are particularly hard to get to or require extensive refining to be made usable. To get the most out of our mineral wealth, we will expand aluminum mining operations in Grand Alaudia and develop the Starfield Steelworks so that our industries never want for materials."

 #HIP_develop_starfield_steelworks:0 "Develop Starfield Steelworks"
 #HIP_develop_starfield_steelworks_desc:0 "Nearly everything we produce needs steel, from shovels to battleships. Starfield is the center of our refining of iron ore into steel, so it's only logical to expand production there."

 ### ARMY FOCUSES
 HIP_defence_department:0 "Department of Defence"
 HIP_defence_department_desc:0 "In a world filled with threats, we will need a strong army to safeguard our borders. This Department will both cover our army's modernisation and its central administration."

 HIP_modern_weapon_contests:0 "Modern Weaponry Contests"
 HIP_modern_weapon_contests_desc:0 "By holding contests for the best-designed guns and grenades, we can ensure top-of-the-line performance for all our troops. Soldiers are in short supply, so our guns have to be the best we can possibly make them."

 HIP_army_armament_bonds:0 "Armament Bonds"
 HIP_army_armament_bonds_desc:0 "Selling bonds will help us raise the money to build weapons factories. In the event we're attacked, it'll also let us quickly liquidate our funds to shift civilian factories to military ones."

 HIP_continue_army_modernisation:0 "Continue Army Modernisation"
 HIP_continue_army_modernisation_desc:0 "As a small nation, we have always believed that our first and foremost priority for the army should be better guns than our foes. Some military theorists advocate for changing our course, while others say that what has served us well should remain. Either way, keeping our theory of war modern is absolutely critical in these times."

 HIP_fund_royal_island:0 "Fund the Royal Island Gunworks"
 HIP_fund_royal_island_desc:0 "We have long used cannons in our armies. Big guns let us blast our enemies from afar, keeping our own troops safe. Having Royal Island design new artillery will let us prepare for whatever our enemies throw at us!"

 HIP_army_motorisation:0 "Motorising the Army"
 HIP_army_motorisation_desc:0 "Any attacks on our soil will have to be quickly repulsed, and any terrorist action countered swiftly. Armored cars and mechanized troop transports will keep our soldiers safe as they go wherever they are needed."

 HIP_armor_training_school:0 "Armored Operations Training"
 HIP_armor_training_school_desc:0 "Tanks can punch through lines and quickly encircle enemies. Even if we choose to avoid aggression, tank destroyers are very useful for stopping our enemies' armored advances."

 HIP_royal_engineers_corps:0 "Expand the Royal Engineer Corps"
 HIP_royal_engineers_corps_desc:0 "Combat engineers can dig trenches, set explosives to breach forts, and operate flamethrowers to smoke our foes out. We must not neglect our engineers, especially the defenses they can give to protect our home."

 HIP_signle_and_logistics_school:0 "A School for Signals and Logistics"
 HIP_signle_and_logistics_school_desc:0 "Modern warfare involves more than guns and planes; it also involves distribution of goods and quick communication. Creating a school dedicated to these less visible but still vital topics will make sure we can synchronize and plan with lightning speed."

 HIP_invite_griffon_officers:0 "Invite Griffon Theorists"
 HIP_invite_griffon_officers_desc:0 "The Griffonian school of war has long been that maximal planning and preparation is the method by which victory is won. We can approach them for guidance on our own war machine to help us organize properly."

 HIP_lessons_from_the_enemy:0 "Lessons from the Enemy"
 HIP_lessons_from_the_enemy_desc:0 "The Storm King's tactics were brutal yet effective. Rapidly organized plans and swift offensives let him conquer most of Zebrica, and doing the same could let us take the fight to any would-be conquerors."

 HIP_grand_alaudia_training_grounds:0 "Training Grounds at Grand Alaudia"
 HIP_grand_alaudia_training_grounds_desc:0 "Grand Alaudia has both jungles and plains, and it's respectably distant from Mount Aris. Summoning our entire army there to practice war games, and then conducting extensive surveys on the experience of both foot soldiers and generals, will help us reorganize our army and refine our military doctrine."

 HIP_air_to_ground_warfare:0 "Air-to-Ground Warfare"
 HIP_air_to_ground_warfare_desc:0 "Paratroopers can land behind enemy lines and quickly disrupt their flow of supply. If we can capture their capitals and industrial centers, we might be able to win wars without ever firing a shot."

 HIP_special_service_force:0 "Special Forces Concentration"
 HIP_special_service_force_desc:0 "Special forces, from mountaineers to paratroopers to even more exotic possibilities like amphibious tanks, are a defining part of the [HIP.GetAdjective] military. We'll need to train more to cover our various operations and maximize the impact of our limited soldiers."

 HIP_jungle_special_forces_school:0 "Jungle Special Forces School"
 HIP_jungle_special_forces_school_desc:0 "Jungles are a nightmare to fight on for everyone. However, we have many jungles across our lands, and by training troops in jungle warfare, we can give our special forces a deadly edge in this dangerous terrain."

 HIP_mountain_warfare_school:0 "Mountain Warfare School"
 HIP_mountain_warfare_school_desc:0 "Mountaineers are a necessity on on any mountain terrain, and as our capital lies atop a great mountain, we'll need to invest heavily to protect it. Mountaineers can make the ost of our home, securing it against any attack."

 HIP_national_defence_draft:0 "National Defence Draft"
 HIP_national_defence_draft_desc:0 "In these terrifying times, we have to take drastic measures. [HIP.GetLeader] has, after extensive deliberation, decided to institute a limited draft. This decision is not taken lightly, but we must ensure the safety of all seaponies and hippogriffs. [HIP.GetName] will never flee again!"

 HIP_royal_legion_of_aris:0 "The Royal Legion of Aris"
 HIP_royal_legion_of_aris_desc:0 "We love peace, but in a violent world, sometimes the only way to preserve peace is to fight. The Royal Legion of Aris will preserve our rights and protect our home against anyone who would take it from us."

 ### AIR FOCUSES
 HIP_air_armament_committee:0 "Establish the Air Armament Committee"
 HIP_air_armament_committee_desc:0 "As the world recovers from the Storm King's defeat, it's more important than ever to make sure we have a strong air force to keep our people safe. Whether that's fighters to protect our own airspace, or bombers to take out the enemy's ability to wage war, we have to be ready for whatever the world throws at us."

 HIP_air_land_warfare_focus:0 "Air-Land Warfare"
 HIP_air_land_warfare_focus_desc:0 "Any war must ultimately be won on land. By focusing our air force around winning land battles, we can push our enemies back whenever they advance, securing our borders forever."

 HIP_tactical_bombing:0 "Tactical Bomber Initiative"
 HIP_tactical_bombing_desc:0 "While we favor close air support to win land battles, tactical bombers are a necessity to cover other operations. They can execute any mission with reasonable effectiveness, from strategic bombing to close air support, and are thus wonderfully flexible."

 HIP_escort_fighters:0 "Escort Fighters"
 HIP_escort_fighters_desc:0 "Our bombers will need protection. Whether strategic bombers deep in enemy territory or CAS striking our straits, heavy fighters can reach across vast distances and defend bombers from local planes."

 HIP_consolidated_aircraft_focus:0 "Consolidated Aircraft"
 HIP_consolidated_aircraft_focus_desc:0 "An airforce built for immense range will let us fight our opponents across the continents. The Consolidated Aircraft company has already offered to aid us in our development."

 HIP_fighter_working_group:0 "Fighter Working Group"
 HIP_fighter_working_group_desc:0 "Enemy bombers will inevitably target our homes and factories. We swam underwater to escape the Storm King's armies, but as much of our industry is on land, doing so is immensely costly. Building fighters will let us engage bombers before they strike our land."

 HIP_young_flyers_programme:0 "Young Fliers Program"
 HIP_young_flyers_programme_desc:0 "Are you doing your part? Our air force is the shield against our foes' bombs and the spear we ready against their charges. If we make this clear to our people, we're bound to have many young hippogriffs flocking to the air force!"

 HIP_academy_of_air_sciences:0 "Academy of Aerial Science"
 HIP_academy_of_air_sciences_desc:0 "With new plane models rolling off the assembly lines, we ought to found a new academy dedicated to the theory of air warfare. We'll likely be able to research other, more esoteric technologies as well..."

 HIP_jet_engine_development:0 "Jet Engines"
 HIP_jet_engine_development_desc:0 "The jet engine has the potential to completely revolutionize flight. With it, we might even be able to break the sound barrier. We can't afford to neglect this promising new field of study!"

 HIP_rocketry_school:0 "Department of Rocketry"
 HIP_rocketry_school_desc:0 "Rockets—self-propelled missiles packed with liquid or solid fuel—have the potential to strike a base in the [CHN.GetName] from the comfort of our own mountain. A way to wage war without a single hippogriff or seapony ever having to leave home is incredibly tempting for obvious reasons. We need to find out more!"

 HIP_atom_committee:0 "Atomic Committee"
 HIP_atom_committee_desc:0 "Our scientists have long known that matter is made up of atoms. Recent findings suggest that certain atoms, in particular uranium and plutonium, can be split, and that such an event, properly controlled, could cause a chain reaction, unleashing incalculable destruction and loss of civilian life. We don't want to kill innocents, of course, but even having such a weapon could prove a mighty deterrent."

 HIP_strategic_obliteration_doctraine:0 "Strategic Obliteration Doctrine"
 HIP_strategic_obliteration_doctraine_desc:0 "Victory in war can only be achieved by the total obliteration of our enemy's capability to wage war. Without air bases, dockyards, railways, roads, mines, stockpiles, and industries they will have no capability to stand up to us and the morale of the enemy's population will plummet."

 HIP_bomber_offensive:0 "Bomber Offensive"
 HIP_bomber_offensive_desc:0 "The total destruction of the enemy's capability to wage war can only be achieved by increasing the size of our bomber fleet. More bombers means more bombs, and more bombs means fewer guns for the enemy."

 HIP_trans_continental_air_warfare:0 "Transcontinental Air Warfare"
 HIP_trans_continental_air_warfare_desc:0 "Our enemies lie across the seas on three continents. We must be able to strike them wherever they might be."

 HIP_cluster_bombing:0 "Cluster Bombing"
 HIP_cluster_bombing_desc:0 "We have developed advanced bombs that eject smaller bomblets specifically designed to eliminate enemy personnel and vehicles. The bomblets are dispersed in a wide area in a single precision strike."

 #Political Focuses
 HIP_plecate_the_isolationists:0 "Placating the Isolationists"
 HIP_plecate_the_isolationists_desc:0 "The isolationist policies have long been championed by the seaponies, who view recent events as evidence that we should stick with isolationism instead of opening up. If we are to make progress, we have to make sure that they are placated."

 HIP_self_efficency:0 "Seapony Autarky"
 HIP_self_efficency_desc:0 "Hippogriffia survived for centuries on its own, and it would be beyond irresponsible to abandon this policy. Between invaders, slavers, mad foreigners and countless other threats, we must make sure to rally all the strength we possess for the benefit of our nation, not others'."

 HIP_anti_harmonic_activities_committee:0 "The Anti-Harmonic Activities Committee"
 HIP_anti_harmonic_activities_committee_desc:0 "Stalliongrad, Chiropterra, Griffonia, the Stormlanders: foreign ideologies and interests can be found everywhere, and many of these are driven by interests directly opposed to ours. We must carefully weigh these ideas, and determine which ones are a threat to our way of life and which aren't."

 HIP_committie_for_national_defence:0 "The Committee for National Defense"
 HIP_committie_for_national_defence_desc:0 "War will come to our nation's borders once again, whether sooner or later. The ravages of the Storm King proved that we cannot simply hide, but the next time foreign princesses will not come along to save us. We must plan for all scenarios from now on, no matter how dire."

 HIP_expand_the_royal_acadamy:0 "Universal Education"
 HIP_expand_the_royal_acadamy_desc:0 "Every child born in our nation has the right to be given a full education, both on land and in the sea. Whether rich or poor, and whether seapony or hippogriff, we cannot leave anyone behind."

 HIP_long_distance_friendship:0 "Long Distance Friendship"
 HIP_long_distance_friendship_desc:0 "We want to be self-reliant, but that does not mean that we are going to forget the friends we do have. Those who give kindness can be given it in return, and we will both be stronger for it."

 HIP_leand_lease:0 "Lend-Lease"
 HIP_leand_lease_desc:0 "Even if we cannot directly aid our friends in war, we can still make sure they are given the tools needed to finish the job. Our factories stand ready to churn out countless weapons needed, and our friends will have access to it for the lowest price we can charge."

 HIP_the_mountain_awakes:0 "The Mountain Awakes"
 HIP_the_mountain_awakes_desc:0 "We were asleep, but now we have awaken. The mountain is no longer silent, but it resonates with the sound of labour and preparations. Beware, all who would threaten us. We are ready for you, and we will be your undoing."

 HIP_traditional_studdies:0 "Never Forget Our Roots"
 HIP_traditional_studdies_desc:0 "We cannot, must not, forget who we are. To ensure this, our children will receieve a throrough education in our history and traditions, and all who wish to work towards its preservation and continuation will be given support in their endevours."

 HIP_prepare_for_the_next_war:0 "Prepare For the Next War"
 HIP_prepare_for_the_next_war_desc:0 "The world is turning more and more violent, and it is all we can do to prepare ourselves as much as we can. If that day finally comes, it will not find us unprepared or off guard."

 HIP_expand_costal_fortifications:0 "Expand Coastal Fortifications"
 HIP_expand_costal_fortifications_desc:0 "Anycreature who sets a single hoof or claw on our islands will be met with resistance from the get-go. If they establish a beachhead, it might already be too late, so we must make sure they will never be able to."

 HIP_youth_defence_league:0 "The Youth Defense League"
 HIP_youth_defence_league_desc:0 "We would never place our children in harms way, but in war there are many duties necessary, including several that will keep them able to aid in the struggle, but still remain out of the way of the actual fighting."

 HIP_never_to_fall_again:0 "As the War Approaches"
 HIP_never_to_fall_again_desc:0 "When the Storm King came, we could have lost everything. The next time war comes - and it will come sooner or later - we shall be ready to meet it with all the strength we have."

 HIP_trade_ports:0 "Designated Trade Ports"

 HIP_agricultral_reforms_desc:0 "The agricultural sector has been left languishing in recent times. With all the development both internally and abroad, the time has come for a dedicated effort to make sure that our farmers can keep feeding our people even if the worst happens."

 HIP_encourage_private_enterprise:0 "Encourage Private Enterprises"
 HIP_encourage_private_enterprise_desc:0 "As our nation grows, so will its industry, but it'd only bloat the nation to try to run everything centrally.

 HIP_national_defence_works:0 "National Defense Works"
 HIP_national_defence_works_desc:0 "Modern wars are won not just on the battlefield, but in the factories as well. We must be ready to produce immense amounts of weaponry for when the war comes, and there is no time like the present to get started."

 HIP_stock_exchange:0 "The Aris Stock Exchange"
 HIP_stock_exchange_desc:0 "The world is woven together more tightly than ever before, and like the currents and winds, trade, wealth and prosperity is more understood as a "flow" than a fixed thing. Opening the Aris Stock Exchange will let us partake in this flow, and control it to some extent."

 HIP_encourage_tourism_desc:0 "Our home is among the most beautiful regions in the world, and visitors agree. Opening up for tourist enterprises will net us another source of revenue, as well as making sure that thousands of creatures across the world will go home with positive experiences of us."

 HIP_cut_industral_red_tape:0 "Cut the Industrial Red Tape"
 HIP_cut_industral_red_tape_desc:0 "Our industry suffers from miles upon miles of red tape. It might have been well-intentioned, but it is simply stifling us.

 HIP_encourage_the_automotive_industry_desc:0 "The car did have some difficulties getting established in Hippogriffia, being neither able to fly nor swim, but over time more and more of us have come to enjoy both as a tool and as entertainment.

At the same time we have made leaps and bounds in industrial innovation which would have been impossible without the pressure of war. Our enemies shall be crushed beneath the colossus of Hippogriff industry, and we shall emerge from this war stronger and more prosperous than ever."

 HIP_unity_propaganda:0 "Hippogriff-Seapony Friendship"

 HIP_limited_democratic_representation:0 "Limited Democratic Representation"
 HIP_limited_democratic_representation_desc:0 "Hippogriffia is currently the only harmonist nation that embraces absolutism; in practice even Equestria has local democratic institutions and political traditions which limit the princesses. 11th-century harmony requires checks on monarchical power and giving the people a voice."

 HIP_reform_the_royal_advisory_council_desc:0 "In previous generations, the queen was advised by a council of commoners.

 HIP_shelter_dissidents:0 "Shelter Dissidents"
 HIP_shelter_dissidents_desc:0 "Political dissidents in Colthage are subject to persecution and outright violence.

 HIP_reconciliation:0 "Reconciliation"

 HIP_restore_friendship:0 "Restore Friendship"
 HIP_restore_friendship_desc:0 "The seaponies were not cowardly: they fought in the war same as the hippogriffs. The hippogriffs were not arrogant: they merely wanted to protect their friends from the aggression of the other regional powers. We all did our part, it just wasn't enough given the circumstances. We must stop blaming one another for losing the war, and come together as friends once again."

 HIP_moment_of_truth:0 "The Moment of Truth"
 HIP_moment_of_truth_desc:0 "We have stretched ourselves thin, and with the deadline of returning to the world stage looming, the secessionists and anti-Harmonists are preparing for a final push. We can only hope that our subjects will stand with us, and put their trust in Harmony and unity once more."

 HIP_demobilize_economy:0 "A Time of Healing"
 HIP_demobilize_economy_desc:0 "Silverstream suggests we lower work quotas, ease wartime rationing measures, and redirect our economy to providing for our subjects in these difficult times.

 HIP_permanent_war_econ:0 "A Time of Strife"

 HIP_absolutism_desc:0 "Hippogriffia is still an absolute monarchy. While we have ruled with a light claw for many years, the present circumstances do not allow that.

 HIP_survival_first:0 "Survival First"
 HIP_survival_first_desc:0 "Our kingdom has never shied away from doing what was necessary to survive, whether that has meant biding our time in Seaquestria, vanquishing the Storm King, fighting the North Zebrican War, or indeed signing our surrender. We will continue to survive, and we will endure long after the enemies we faced have faded to dust and memories."

 HIP_history_will_vindicate_us:0 "History Will Vindicate Us"
 HIP_history_will_vindicate_us_desc:0 "These last few months have fundamentally changed life in Hippogriffia.

We must do everything we can to deradicalise the civilian population of Chiropterra and secure a lasting peace."
 HIP_partition_cth:0 "Partition Colthage"
 HIP_partition_cth_desc:0 "Many of Colthage's problems stem from the city of Colthage exploiting the other regions in the republic. Simply putting a harmonist Sufrit in charge would hardly fix the underlying problem. While they may one day reunite if that is their wish, for now at least we should partition Colthage into its constituent city-states, each with their own reconstruction government."
 HIP_align_cth:0 "A Harmonist Sufrit"
 HIP_align_cth_desc:0 "Jezebzella and the other Harmonites and constitutionalists are ready to hold a new convention to draft a new constitution for Colthage which enshrines Harmonist values and ensures no sufrit turns Colthage into a dictatorship as the Zarcids did. We wish her luck, and hope that soon Colthage wil be a shining example of Harmony in North Zebrica."
 HIP_reconfigure_nz_diplomacy:0 "Reconfigure North Zebrican Diplomacy"
 HIP_reconfigure_nz_diplomacy_desc:0 "North Zebrica was hardly stable before the Chiropterrans attacked. In order to ensure lasting peace in the region, we must settle old territorial disputes like the Tobuck issue, using our position as the region's dominant power to act as peacebrokers."
 HIP_request_equestrian_aid:0 "Request Equestrian Aid"
 HIP_request_equestrian_aid_desc:0 "Equestria has some scholars and southeastern moonspeakers who may know how to untangle the webs of hatred and twisted religion which bind the Chiropterrans. We should invite them here as advisors on how to handle the Chiropterran situation."

 HIP_trial_of_bat_leaders_desc:0 "After months of searching, we have found the remaining records of the LMRD's archives of horror.

 HIP_intervene_in_great_war_desc:0 "While we fought the North Zebrican War, our friends in Equestria were embroiled in a far greater conflict against a power as terrible as Chiropterra: Queen Chrysalis and the Changelings. With our newly-expanded forces, we will turn the tide in the Great War!"

 HIP_parliment_and_executive:0 "Draft a Constitution"
 HIP_parliment_and_executive_desc:0 "Queen Skystar has always been an innovator, and she has decreed that modern Harmony requires more than just a benevolent autocrat. She will expand and codify the authority of Parliament, formally devolving legislative power away from the crown and vesting sovereignty in the people, while retaining executive power in the fins of the monarch."
 HIP_entrench_representation:0 "Entrench Representative Institutions"
 HIP_entrench_representation_desc:0 "While we have no need to embrace constitutionalism, our existing representative institutions have proven quite capable at governing. The crown shall take a step back from legislation, and over time the role of democracy in our kingdom will expand naturally."
 HIP_reassert_absolutism:0 "Reaffirm Royal Sovereignty"
 HIP_reassert_absolutism_desc:0 "Queen Novo asserts that Harmony in Aris has always been monarchist, and that the system has worked marvellously. While she has great respect for Harmonic republics, that is not our way. The crown's sovereignty will remain absolute, and the monarchy shall continue to look after the creatures of Aris for centuries to come."
 HIP_trust_carrot_stick:0 "Trust in Carrot Stick"
 HIP_trust_carrot_stick_desc:0 "Chiropterra may have done terrible things, but Harmony means giving your enemies a second chance. The insurgents have largely been pacified, and with the exposure of the crimes of the LMRD, many Chiropterrans truly are sorry and want to rebuild as something better. We will give them that chance, and hopefully we will one day be able to call them friends."
 HIP_skybeak_plan:0 "The Silverstream Plan"
 HIP_skybeak_plan_desc:0 "In order to make our former enemies into future allies, Silverstream has proposed issuing interest-free reconstruction loans to get them back on their hooves. This will go a long way to alleviating the grudges of the war and to making a stable North Zebrica."
 HIP_expand_zarantian_oil_fields:0 "Expand the Zarantian Oil Fields"
 HIP_expand_zarantian_oil_fields_desc:0 "The Imazeeb have discovered huge oil wells deep beneath their territories.

 HIP_nz_reconstruction:0 "North Zebrican Reconstruction"
 HIP_nz_reconstruction_desc:0 "All the armies of the North Zebrican War had a large engineering corps. We should put these veterans and soldiers to work rebuilding the infrastructure of the lands they fought over: building bridges for peace, rather than for war."
 HIP_nzfta:0 "Found NZFTA"
 HIP_nzfta_desc:0 "While direct aid is necessary in the short term, in the long run we want all of our allies to have strong, prosperous economies. We will establish a free trade zone in North Zebrica, eliminating tariffs and using common customs standards to facilitate commerce and prosperity."

 HIP_north_zebrican_coalition_desc:0 "New hope is emerging in the lands of our former enemies.

 HIP_rct_agency:0 "In-Depth Cooperation with the OHS"
 HIP_rct_agency_desc:0 "While many criticize the OHS, they are without a doubt the most effective intelligence agency in the Harmonist world. We should reach out to them, sharing intelligence and data so that we can each protect Harmony better."
 HIP_eqs_agency:0 "Preserving Friendship with SMILE"
 HIP_eqs_agency_desc:0 "The Equestrians are natural allies to Hippogriffia, and their experience dealing with VOPS has probably taught them even more than our experience with the Nightmare's Hoof. We should reach out to SMILE to deepen our cooperation with them."

 HIP_harmonist_syncretic_economics_desc:0 "While we only implemented it out of desperation, in many ways our wartime economy was more Harmonist than our peacetime one: the state, labour unions, and business all working together for the common good.

 HIP_even_more_AHAC:0 "Expand the AHAC's Jurisdiction"
 HIP_even_more_AHAC_desc:0 "Aris First has some big ideas for expanding the power and reach of the AHAC.

 HIP_moderate_security_policy:0 "Crime and Criminals"

 HIP_hardline_security_policy:0 "Enemies and Undesirables"
 HIP_hardline_security_policy_desc:0 "Crack Lightning's proposal is to subordinate the AHAC's mandate to the objective interests of the Hippogriff nation: it is to be used not only as a tool of national defense, but national purification, taking proactive measures to watch and if necessary detain the detractors of Aris First, and those whose racial or cultural background makes them inherently suspect."

 HIP_curtail_the_phalanx:0 "Monitor the Phalanx"
 HIP_curtail_the_phalanx_desc:0 "We expected the Phalanx to disperse after our victory, but instead they have become bolder, swaggering about our streets like flipperball hooligans and disturbing the peace. Raft Wood will ensure the police know that the Phalanx are not above the law, and if the worst should happen, there is always the Anti-Harmonic Terrorism Act."

 HIP_unleash_the_phalanx:0 "Unleash the Phalanx"
 HIP_unleash_the_phalanx_desc:0 "The Phalanx are the most patriotic seaponies and hippogriffs in our nation, and their numbers grow daily. They could prove invaluable as rapid-response units if anti-Arisian radicals attack our way of life. A few words from Crack Lightning to the right officers, and the police won't get in the way of the Phalanx any more."

 HIP_the_storm_breaks:0 "The Storm Breaks"
 HIP_the_storm_breaks_desc:0 "What we have warned about for so long has finally come to pass: Hippogriffia is at war with a foreign power. We must mobilize all of Aris to meet this threat. At the same time, the pressure of war pushes the Aris First coalition to the breaking point..."

 HIP_fuck_off_zeebs:0 "The Zumidian Problem"
 HIP_fuck_off_zeebs_desc:0 "We will close the borders of Zumidia to refugees, and immediately deny all applications to move to Mount Aris. While the coalition is divided on exactly how to go about it, we will ensure that the zebras are not a problem for us much longer."

 HIP_moderate_racism:0 "A Clean Break"
 HIP_moderate_racism_desc:0 "Raft Wood argues that we have already wasted too much money on ungrateful Zumidians.

 HIP_hardline_racism:0 "They Have Their Uses"
 HIP_hardline_racism_desc:0 "Crack Lightning insists that Zumidia is too ore-rich to abandon entirely, and that its zebras could prove useful.

 HIP_hardline_strategy_desc:0 "Crack Lightning's strategy for the North Zebrican War would see us use our naval superiority to launch daring attacks on the enemy's coastal cities, which hold most of their war industry.

If this ragtag bunch is to accomplish anything, cooperation will have to be put into place. One way or another, Hippogriffia will break free from the shackles of capitalism!"
 HIP_hippogriffias_own_path_to_socialism:0 "Hippogriffia's Own Path to Communism"
 HIP_hippogriffias_own_path_to_socialism_desc:0 "Anarchism is an old tradition in Hippogriffia, so why should we turn the ideas of a madfish when we have something perfectly serviceable right here? Power will be devolved and the state abolished."
 HIP_import_the_revolution:0 "The Marksist Revolution"
 HIP_import_the_revolution_desc:0 "A stateless society is a desirable end, to be sure, but to get there will take a transitional dictatorship of the proletariat. It is absolutely essential that at this vulnerable time we not falter. Stalliongrad may have made some errors, but that simply means we must do better this time. After all, isn't dialectics the essence of communism?"
 HIP_the_triumphant_revolution:0 "The Revolution Triumphant"
 HIP_the_triumphant_revolution_desc:0 "Against all the wealth of the capitalists and cruelty of the imperialists, we prevailed. Now Hippogriffia stands ready to begin exporting the revolution globally, as it was always meant to be. To the workers of the world!"
 HIP_reorganise_the_armed_forces:0 "The Blue Military"
 HIP_reorganise_the_armed_forces_desc:0 "Reactionary and monarchist thinking are disappointingly common among our air force, navy, and army. We must begin reeducating our troops and establishing political commissars, to help keep their morale high and to make sure they understand what they are fighting for. We die for more than Hippogriffia now; we die for every oppressed creature everywhere!"
 HIP_peoples_liberation_army:0 "The Revolutionary Army"
 HIP_peoples_liberation_army_desc:0 "The army takes, the army holds, and ultimately the army plants the flag atop the capital.

 HIP_committee_of_global_liberation:0 "The Committee of Global Liberation"
 HIP_committee_of_global_liberation_desc:0 "To have a revolution in one nation and not export it is the height of folly.

 HIP_modern_revolutionary_theory:0 "Modern Revolutionary Theory"
 HIP_modern_revolutionary_theory_desc:0 "It is not sufficient to merely have a talented, adept armed forces; we must have the knowledge and skill to properly employ them.

 HIP_destory_the_methods_of_war:0 "Destroy the Methods of War"
 HIP_destory_the_methods_of_war_desc:0 "War is a horrific affair, and nowhere is that more evident than the horrors brought with strategic bombing. Carpet bombing, napalm, and worse coat whole cities. Such suffering is incalculable, and it is doubly awful how many could have been our comrades. Nonetheless, we must engage in this dirty practice ourselves. Every bullet stopped from reaching the frontline is a comrade saved."

 HIP_peoples_liberation_navy:0 "The Revolutionary Navy"
 HIP_peoples_liberation_navy_desc:0 "The navy will let us bring the revolution to any shores anywhere in the world. With every imperialist ship sent fleeing, with every enemy invasion sunk, the flag of communism flies higher. New admirals shall be trained, and our navy shall be geared around the most critical points, both within a ship and within a battle. One sub's good torpedo to a magazine can destroy a battleship."
 HIP_liberation_of_the_high_seas:0 "Victory on the High Seas"
 HIP_liberation_of_the_high_seas_desc:0 "Wars are won on the operational level, not the tactical level.

 HIP_integrate_the_north:0 "Integrate North Zebrica"
 HIP_integrate_the_north_desc:0 "Tobuck, Warzena, Zarantia. These places have all been burdened by capitalism and reaction, but at last we have freed them. Now we must reorganize administration, rule with a kinder fin, and welcome our brothers and sisters into the fold of revolutionary communism!"

 HIP_the_matter_of_class_enemies_desc:0 "As described in Marks's Capital, the rich are not at fault for being rich; the system simply requires some winners, and they are as much puppets of history as we are. But that does not mean that excessive cruelty is inevitable, nor that it shouldn't be punished. We will attend to each capitalist and reactionary as they deserve, meeting kindness with mercy and wickedness with punishment."
 HIP_redeem_the_monarchy:0 "Spare the Monarchy"
 HIP_redeem_the_monarchy_desc:0 "Unlike many monarchies around the world, the Hippogriffian royal line ruled with kindness and fairness. While we must strip them of their titles in accordance with Marksist theory, we do not need to treat them harshly.

 HIP_a_bit_of_poetic_justice_desc:0 "While Comrade Posada was tempted with the thought of forcing former CEOs to be paid the wages of the lowest-paid employee within their companies, such ideation is contrary to the goals of the revolution. They will instead be placed with the common workers they once oppressed, to hopefully learn some humility and kindness through honest work."
 HIP_fate_of_the_imperialists:0 "A Solution to the Imperialist Problem"
 HIP_fate_of_the_imperialists_desc:0 "Worse than even fascists are imperialists; those who would conquer and subjugate and pillage and burn simply to satisfy their own hunger for more. Hippogriffia slew one such tyrant a few years ago. The time has come to finish off the rest of them."
 HIP_admiral_skystar:0 "Promote New Admirals"
 HIP_admiral_skystar_desc:0 "We will have the largest and grandest navy in the world, and such a fleet will by nature necessitate many new officers. With the sacking of several counterrevolutionary officers, the need is more urgent than ever. Perhaps we can arrange a naval wargame for members of the naval commissariat, to see which of these enthusiastic young revolutionaries is fit to command a fleet..."

 HIP_junior_pioneers:0 "The Junior Pioneers"
 HIP_junior_pioneers_desc:0 "The children are the future of the revolution, and it is paramount that they be trained and taught. As communists we follow a process to achieve communism, and it will be the children raised in a dictatorship of the proletariat who will finally lead us there. They are not merely pioneers of their peers; they are pioneers of the future for us all."
 HIP_praxis_backed_by_theory:0 "Praxis Backed by Theory"
 HIP_praxis_backed_by_theory_desc:0 "Theory without praxis is navel-gazing, and praxis without theory is chaos. Only together can communism be achieved, and so together we shall forge the future. Everyone in the nation will receive a full education, going as far as they desire. Be it technical, academic, or martial, no one shall be untaught!"
 HIP_centeral_committee_of_national_administration:0 "The Central Committee"
 HIP_centeral_committee_of_national_administration_desc:0 "A revolution requires central administration. While some comrades believe it should be limited and small, only anarchists seriously argue for a lack of any centralization. Therefore the Central Committee will be created to ensure activities are controlled and managed on a national level."
 HIP_the_hearts_of_the_griffs:0 "The Hearts of the People"
 HIP_the_hearts_of_the_griffs_desc:0 "False consciousness is a troubling element in every state. Some workers simply do not understand how communism will aid them personally, and believe the capitalist lies that we seek to oppress and hurt them. Therefore we will begin a massive education wave, accompanied by sweeping reforms, to show the people that we are on their side. No proletarian should fear their own dictatorship."
 HIP_raceless_society:0 "Raceless Society"
 HIP_raceless_society_desc:0 "Hippogriff, seapony, zebra, or pony; all are equals in our new communist society. Racism shall be eradicated completely, and those ethnonationalists who would drive a wedge between workers will face the workers' justice!"
 HIP_kickstart_nuclear_program:0 "The Atom Burns Blue"
 HIP_kickstart_nuclear_program_desc:0 "General Secretary Posada has always known that the mighty atom is the hammer with which we shall break the back of capitalism. Our nuclear program must be the most powerful in the world. We shall develop atomic energy that will show the world just how mighty the force of international communism truly is! With weapons such as these, the Storm Kings of the world will cower in terror!"
 HIP_eradicate_poverty:0 "Annihilate Poverty"
 HIP_eradicate_poverty_desc:0 "Every worker, farmer, and soldier deserves a rich, fulfilling life. While many other left-wing states have made efforts to abolish poverty, in most of them the workers did not have the benefit of a truly prosperous economy. Here in Hippogriffia, we are blessed with one of the wealthiest economies in the world, and so we have the capability to reach a 0% poverty rate."
 HIP_seize_private_industires:0 "The Factories of the Future"
 HIP_seize_private_industires_desc:0 "It is absolutely necessary that we continue industrialization and mechanization as intensively as possible. We are surrounded by capitalist vultures eying us hungrily, and to show weakness for an instance risks being devoured. Therefore all private industries shall be seized and nationalized, subject to collectivization as quickly as possible."
 HIP_collectivise_the_farmland:0 "Collective Farms"
 HIP_collectivise_the_farmland_desc:0 "It is insufficient to have the state running all business, for in such a case we have simply created a new form of capitalism--state capitalism! The workers must be placed in charge of their economic production. The easiest place to start will be the seaweed and algae farms, which have always been a hotbed of shared cooperation."
 HIP_share_the_means_of_production:0 "Worker-Owned Means of Production"
 HIP_share_the_means_of_production_desc:0 "Every worker shall own the means of production. The state shall act as administrator when necessary, but all returns shall be directed back into the workers who toil for the good of each other. This, of course, is a temporary arrangement; once our position is secured, we will be able to move beyond the need for a profit-driven economy and into a utility or even gift economy."
 HIP_ensure_luxuary_goods_production:0 "Luxury for All"
 HIP_ensure_luxuary_goods_production_desc:0 "An adequate life is inadequate; good enough is not good enough. Luxury, previously the privilege of the wealthy, can now be the right of all workers. No more shall naysayers claim that communism is the equal sharing of miseries!"
 HIP_establish_the_csr:0 "Establish the CSR"
 HIP_establish_the_csr_desc:0 "However much we may wish it was otherwise, there are still dangerous elements seeking to destroy our communist society. We must form an intelligence agency with strong powers of investigation to root out active and present threats. However, we cannot let such an organization become oppressive. The Committee for the Security of the Revolution will not be turned into a weapon against the people."
 HIP_standardise_living_conditions:0 "Standardize Living Conditions"
 HIP_standardise_living_conditions_desc:0 "In some allegedly communist states,the party bureaucrats rise to wealth and privilege above their comrades. They live in luxurious palaces painted red, and profit as a new labor aristocracy. That can never happen here. Every party member's salary shall be restricted to that of the least well-off creature in the nation."
 HIP_revolutionary_underwater_construction:0 "Aqueous Construction Initiative"
 HIP_revolutionary_underwater_construction_desc:0 "Seaquestria is as much a part of Revolutionary North Zebrica as Mount Aris, and while there are a million engineering and logistical challenges to conducting heavy industry underwater, building factories in Seaquestria will keep them out of reach of our countless enemies. None shall ever touch our aquatic industrial base!"
 HIP_workers_paradise:0 "A Worker's Paradise"
 HIP_workers_paradise_desc:0 "Healthcare, safe conditions, friendly coworkers, fair hours, and the abolition of the wage system - these are all common demands of the proletariat. As the dictatorship of the proletariat grows in power, we find ourselves in a position to answer these calls. Let us banish want forever!"

 HIP_the_immortal_science_of_dialectical_materialism_desc:0 "Caramel Marks was a great scholar, and more than that, she was a great pony. But she is dead, and to adhere to her ideas blindly is to adopt a new religion. We must always apply her methods to her own writings, and to every so-called leftist state in the world. Only then can we see true communism begin to emerge."
 HIP_prepare_for_first_strike:0 "War Plan Uranium"
 HIP_prepare_for_first_strike_desc:0 "Colthage and Chiropterra, two evil states. Chiropterra is an insane cult that practices slavery, sapient experimentation, and worse, and Colthaginian slaver lords profit off the backs of their subjects.

The decision is up to the General Secretary."

 HIP_steal_chiropterras_stuff_desc:0 "The Nightmarists discovered horrifying things in their pursuit of victory at any cost. While we cannot abide such cruel experimentation, we can certainly benefit from their findings and utilize these discoveries against other reactionaries.

 HIP_undersea_reactors_desc:0 "Previously deemed too detrimental on the environment, undersea reactors are rapidly proving necessary.

 HIP_depleted_uranium:0 "Depleted Uranium Applications"
 HIP_depleted_uranium_desc:0 "After nuclear refining is done, we have massive surpluses of depleted uranium left behind.

 HIP_integrate_cth:0 "Sweep the Remainder"
 HIP_integrate_cth_desc:0 "Quaggatai is a nation run by reactionaries for reactionary ends. It must be defeated for the sake of the lives under it and the lives of those adjacent to it.

We will seize these lands through diplomacy or combat as material conditions require."

 HIP_absolute_education:0 "Absolute Right to Learn"
 HIP_absolute_education_desc:0 "Any creature that desires to learn shall be able to. From preschool to graduate, all learning will be provided for by the state.

 HIP_harmonic_cooperation:0 "Cooperate with the Harmonists"
 HIP_harmonic_cooperation_desc:0 "Comrade Silverstream leads a minority faction in the party advocating for avoiding excessive brutality or authoritarianism.

 HIP_democratic_centralism:0 "Democratic Centralism"
 HIP_democratic_centralism_desc:0 "It is only logical to follow Steel Stallion's application and allow for the majority to rule, as they do in bourgeois democracies.

 HIP_the_hippogriff_model_desc:0 "Steel Stallion was a great pony, but to call yourself a "Stallionist" is to put up a hero to be worshipped instead of another traveler along the same path. We must always improve upon those that have gone before, and Stalliongrad's system fell to infighting and factionalism after Stallion's death.

 HIP_an_admitted_monster_desc:0 "Posada did terrible things by her own admission. We can respect the good work she did for the workers without praising or legitimizing the atrocities she committed. For the nation to begin healing, it is time for all of us to confess our own wrongdoings."

 HIP_ignite_atom:0 "Ignite the Fires of the Atom"

 HIP_purge_moderates_desc:0 "Within the Party and the populace at large, there are many who profess loyalty to our cause while objecting to our methods.

Technological superiority was of insufficient use against our foes, and now we are faced with a grim question.\n\nWhat do we do now?"
 HIP_anarchia_mama:0 "A Different Approach"
 HIP_anarchia_mama_desc:0 "This war has only confirmed the fears of the anarchists relating to "Revolutionary North Zebrica": the supposedly materialist authoritarian communists are in fact themselves utopian idealists, lost in their visions of post-scarcity and blind to the real material conditions of this nation-state. We can no longer trust in benevolence among our rulers. It's time to seize our own fate!"
 HIP_prepare_insurrection:0 "Prepare an Insurrection"
 HIP_prepare_insurrection_desc:0 "The blue tyrants have betrayed us before, and there is no doubt they will do so again when the opportunity presents itself.

 HIP_peaceful_transfer:0 "The Peaceful Transfer of Power"
 HIP_peaceful_transfer_desc:0 "While the authoritarians have failed, they are not our enemies. Rather, they are misguided comrades we must help see the error of their ways.

 HIP_one_more_try_desc:0 "Revolutionary communism has not failed us; we have failed revolutionary communism. But we can't give up, or toss the chick out with the eggshells.

 HIP_cheat_on_treaty_desc:0 "The treaty has no legitimacy because it is signed between class enemies.

 HIP_request_foreign_aid_desc:0 "We have comrades from all over the world eager to help us.

 HIP_our_own_anarchism:0 "Seaquestria's Own Anarchist Society"
 HIP_our_own_anarchism_desc:0 "Anarchism is more than a word. It is the opposition to all tyrants, to all powers, to any form of control. We are not anarchists out of idealism, but cynicism! We have seen the fruits of authoritarianism in the horrors of the North Zebrican War! Our rallying cry is simple - never again."
 HIP_anti_hierarchy_movement:0 "The Anti-Hierarchy Movement"
 HIP_anti_hierarchy_movement_desc:0 "Hierarchy is the placing of one life, one will, one culture above another.

 HIP_school_based_life_desc:0 "Before the invention of agriculture, seaponies lived in communal, non-hierarchical shoals.

 HIP_wingnot_accords:0 "Revisit the Wingnot Accords"
 HIP_wingnot_accords_desc:0 "Our mandate was only ever meant to be a temporary measure to ensure the security of Hippogriffia and Zumidia. It's time to meet with Zumidian community leaders at their historic Wingnot Palace to work out the future hoof in claw."

 HIP_expand_highwing_mines:0 "Expand the Highwing Mines"

 HIP_ain_tougot:0 "Urbanize Ain Trotgourait"

 HIP_self_rule:0 "Institute Self-Rule"
 HIP_self_rule_desc:0 "It only makes sense to restore Zumidia to its own state. The Zumidian people deserve to have a ruler of their own. The only question remaining is to what extent we should grant them autonomy. A new conference at Wingnot should take care of that."

 HIP_north_zebrican_union:0 "The North Zebrican Union"
 HIP_north_zebrican_union_desc:0 "It is time to formalize our cooperation with Zumidia into a North Zebrican Union. Mutual protection, economic aid and free trade, and scientific collaboration between our peoples will ensure a harmonic bulwark against any foreign threats."

 HIP_withdraw_from_zebrica:0 "Withdrawal from Zebrica"
 HIP_withdraw_from_zebrica_desc:0 "As we learned from the Storm King's rampage, Zebrica is a dangerous place.

 HIP_CIV_hold_them_back_desc:0 "Every inch of land we lose is an inch we may not get back. Even if we are on our back hoof, it is critical that we keep what we have from the enemy! Do whatever it takes to hold the line, no matter the cost!"

 HIP_CIV_grab_a_weapon:0 "Grab a Weapon"
 HIP_CIV_grab_a_weapon_desc:0 "Being willing to fight is good, but useless if we do not have a gun to give them. Raid the armories, scavenge what you can, take everything of use against the masses who would see our cause burn to ash!"
 HIP_CIV_we_need_more_guns:0 "We Need More Guns!"
 HIP_CIV_we_need_more_guns_desc:0 "What we have taken is good, but we need more and the means to produce them are limited. Cut whatever corners we can, take quantity over quality, for numbers are what will win this war!"

 HIP_CIV_our_last_chance_desc:0 "This is it. If we lose, if we fall here, our cause is dead. Our masters will never return, and our failure will be eternal. So we must win! If your friend falls, take their place and kill two of them for it!

 HIP_SIR_we_got_the_music_desc:0 "Three. In all our time, the only sirens we have ever known have been ourselves. And now it is us against the entire world.

 HIP_SIR_ready_the_masses:0 "Ready the Masses"
 HIP_SIR_ready_the_masses_desc:0 "The magic of my sisters and I are powerful, but it is clear that magic is not the only weapon is this world now. Heroes and monsters do not win battles, armies and weapons do. Adagio may not realize it, but we will need these things if we are to survive in this era now."
 HIP_SIR_no_time_for_games:0 "No Time for Games"
 HIP_SIR_no_time_for_games_desc:0 "Factories are useful tools. They make what others want, and fuel the endless greed that drives creatures to the strife sirens consume. And yet we need them for other things, modern innovations like construction and excavation. Balance is not a word a siren knows well, but we will need to find it nonetheless to avoid a return to the abyss."
 HIP_SIR_an_army_of_our_own:0 "An Army of our Own"
 HIP_SIR_an_army_of_our_own_desc:0 "Conquest requires an army to enforce it. Whereas once the world was backwards, a time where my powers stronger than any mortal, now technology poses a threat to even myself and my fellow sirens.

 HIP_SIR_seize_the_factories:0 ""Seize" the Factories"
 HIP_SIR_seize_the_factories_desc:0 "Other "leaders" in this world do things like nationalize factories, taking them for usage by their "state" instead of private industries. I, as a siren do not have to deal with such trouble. Why would I, when the hippogriffs running them already listen to my every command? It's just telling them to have them do what I want, when I want."
 HIP_SIR_taking_what_we_have:0 "Taking What we Have"
 HIP_SIR_taking_what_we_have_desc:0 "Steel. Aluminum. Rubber. Resources critical to the creation of any army. We must use everything we have to our advantage, so I must send hippogriffs to find more of what we need. Adagio might be interested in these magical crystals under Mount Aris too..."
 HIP_SIR_defending_what_matters:0 "Defending What Matters"
 HIP_SIR_defending_what_matters_desc:0 "There is only one thing that matters here anymore. My survival. Mine, and my fellow sirens. Everything else is secondary.

 HIP_SIR_the_means_of_production:0 "The Means of Production"
 HIP_SIR_the_means_of_production_desc:0 "Weapons are no longer made by craftsmen and blacksmiths in forges, but by ordinary creatures lined up in factories. Normally places like these would be ideal for sowing discord, but in this case I need every factory working for the future.

 HIP_SIR_those_who_fight_for_us:0 "Those who Fight for Us"
 HIP_SIR_those_who_fight_for_us_desc:0 "A modern army is built on discipline, order and the "chain of command". All traits that for sirens are practically unheard of. But an army that fights itself is bound to collapse, so it seems I will need to keep our soldiers on a tighter leash..."
 HIP_SIR_last_minute_preparations:0 "Last Minute Preparations"
 HIP_SIR_last_minute_preparations_desc:0 "Most of these nation-states that now live on this world have forced that have years of experience in war. Mine does not have that luxury, and we don't have the time to make up for it.

 HIP_SIR_the_sound_of_our_voice:0 "The Sound of Our Voice"
 HIP_SIR_the_sound_of_our_voice_desc:0 "A voice is a siren's very being, the core of who they are and what they do. And with it comes a certain inherent right, that to rule over those lower than one's self. Hippogriffia was a start, but this small island is in no way the end of my plans... the rest will just take time."
 HIP_SIR_the_siren_constant:0 "The Siren Constant"
 HIP_SIR_the_siren_constant_desc:0 "Having to manage every single affair on this island is tiring, and ultimately a waste of ability. But keeping one to absolute loyalty usually has negative effects on their capability to manage said affairs. What I need is someone new, someone else who can deal with the trivial issues in my stead, while being loyal without a song or magic."
 HIP_SIR_what_comes_after:0 "What Comes After"
 HIP_SIR_what_comes_after_desc:0 "In shortsighted foolishness, many creatures choose to take up arms and fruitlessly fight against me, even after my victory. My conquests will not end in peace, nor will they resolve over time. A siren's voice will pacify the crowds, but true stability will only come with effort."
 HIP_SIR_the_collaboration_corps:0 "The Collaboration Corps"
 HIP_SIR_the_collaboration_corps_desc:0 "My collaborator has already gone to work in my name, and has come with a curious request. He wishes to start his own official group of underlings, loyal to him and by extension to us to exert force all over Aris. I see no reason why I should not allow him this opportunity, as long as it has results."
 HIP_SIR_spread_the_song:0 "Spread the Song"
 HIP_SIR_spread_the_song_desc:0 "It only takes one listen to my voice for the magic to do its work, but once is never enough to truly appreciate such a gift. Use the radios, spread the music, let all hear the songs I sing all the time, to keep them in line and give me the adoration I deserve."
 HIP_SIR_utilize_the_seaponies:0 "Utilize the Seaponies"
 HIP_SIR_utilize_the_seaponies_desc:0 "The underwater realm I and the others used as a springboard to take the island still has its uses if used well. With us in control of the so-called Pearl of Transformation and its shards, we by extension control all access to and from the deeps, and building in a place no one else can reach may prove beneficial in time."
 HIP_SIR_all_to_the_surface:0 "All to the Surface"
 HIP_SIR_all_to_the_surface_desc:0 "Now that it has served its purpose, the realm beneath the waves and the seaponies that live there serve no more use to me, at least in their current forms. They are needed on the surface, where they can gain a true purpose, just like the rest of the hippogriffs. Abandon the seas, and take your place in the world that belongs to me."

 HIP_SIR_preparing_for_the_next_step_desc:0 "What I have is good, but I always need more. More magic, more to put this world in its rightful place. So, I must take. With a little chaos, deception and just a hint of envy, I will create a wonderful storm of hatred to feed off of. It will not last, but while it does... we will have all the magic we could possibly need."
 HIP_SIR_the_rising_resistance:0 "The Rising Resistance"
 HIP_SIR_the_rising_resistance_desc:0 "The hippogriffs may no longer be in power, but they are not done fighting yet. Even now they plot from their shadows, seeking to overthrow our rule as a thorn in our sides. Ending these games once and for all should be our highest priority."
 HIP_SIR_lies_and_deception:0 "Lies and Deception"
 HIP_SIR_lies_and_deception_desc:0 "Can you really trust the one they call Posada? Her claims of a new society may be grand, but they are rooted in a truly insidious ideology, one which is incompatible with "Harmony" itself. Their crimes can not be allowed to continue, so why do you let them into your very ranks? Can't you see that you're playing right into her hooves?"
 HIP_SIR_fear_and_doubt:0 "Fear and Doubt"
 HIP_SIR_fear_and_doubt_desc:0 "Aris First tells you that they only have the interests of hippogriffs at heart and nothing more. But in truth, their ambitions are far greater than they would have you believe. Nationalism is a rot, a poison that kills everything you claim to fight for. It causes pain, suffering and death, and allowing it into your nation will cause all those things to closely follow."
 HIP_SIR_break_them_apart:0 "Break Them Apart"
 HIP_SIR_break_them_apart_desc:0 "The resistance is at a breaking point, the various factions at each other's throats. All they need is the smallest push to go over the edge, and we are very willing to provide that push. Once their unity is in the grave, hunting down whatever remains will be foal's play."
 HIP_SIR_the_revolutionary:0 "The Revolutionary"
 HIP_SIR_the_revolutionary_desc:0 "Posada. A nobody turned firebrand revolutionary, and the face of the communist faction of the resistance. Her ideals are fundamentally flawed, her words of "equality" are nothing but lies, but her fanaticism means she will not fall easily. But still, she will fall."
 HIP_SIR_the_princess:0 "The Princess"
 HIP_SIR_the_princess_desc:0 "Princess Skystar is the linchpin in everything the resistance is and has done.

 HIP_SIR_the_nationalist_desc:0 "Crack Lightning, a wolf in sheep's clothing. Charismatic, intelligent, and deceptive. In a different situation, he might have been even been able to take over this country. Unfortunately for him, we are the ones who hunt wolves.

 HIP_SIR_death_of_the_revolution:0 "Death of the Revolution"
 HIP_SIR_death_of_the_revolution_desc:0 "After a fair bit more effort than we had originally hoped, Posada has finally been captured.

While we are able to transform between our seapony and hippogriff forms thanks to the shards of Novo's Pearl of Transformation which every hippogriff carries, the overwhelming majority of our citizens spend nearly all their time in one form or another. This leads to different cultures, different ways of life, different economic and infrastructural needs, and a different attitude towards the world: seaponies see very little to gain from the outside world, since no one but us makes things for undersea living, while the hippogriffs mostly desire increased interaction with the broader world.

 HIP_future_infantry_rifle:0 "Project SALVO"
 HIP_future_infantry_rifle_desc:0 "One of Terrafin's dearest desires is to see every infantrygriff carrying a weapon of the future. This has already manifested in the use of magical weaponry, but we must go further. Imagine recoil-dampening spells, weapons firing three times as fast as traditional rifles, guns that fire small explosive charges to effectively shoot around corners! Although the venerable slugthrower will be very hard to improve on, our scientists are surely up to the task."
 HIP_future_tank:0 "Project SHATTER"
 HIP_future_tank_desc:0 "Heavy tanks are obviously the future of armored warfare, but current heavies simply aren't powerful enough and run into problems with their transmissions and engines. A true super-heavy tank, not merely an upscaled heavy but a tank designed to kill them, will provide a powerful front-line advantage over heavy tanks and comfortable superiority against anything lighter.\n\nTo be properly useful, of course, it will have to be amphibious as well."
 HIP_future_bomber:0 "Project STARFIRE"
 HIP_future_bomber_desc:0 "Traditional bombers remain highly vulnerable to fighters and interceptors. To counter this threat and truly become a global power, we will have to design something radically different. Flying far faster and higher than traditional bombers, our Valkyrie will be virtually invulnerable to conventional AA as well as interceptors. While this may necessitate some compromises in other parts of the design, it will surely prove worthwhile once completed."
 HIP_nuclear_air_to_air_missiles:0 "Project FALLOUT"
 HIP_nuclear_air_to_air_missiles_desc:0 "A single strategic bomber can rightfully be called a "Flying Fortress," and an entire formation of them is extremely difficult for our fighters to engage. Project FALLOUT would see some of our fighters armed with unguided air-to-air rockets tipped with a low-yield nuclear warhead: the massive blast wave would turn enemy bomber's formations against them, downing an entire wing in a single fireball."
 HIP_nuclear_depth_charges:0 "Project BOTTOMFEEDER"
 HIP_nuclear_depth_charges_desc:0 "Our current depth charges are effective, but due to their limited blast radius they often fail to disable their targets, particularly if the submarine detects the charge and changes depth before it goes off. The Exotic Weaponry Commission has come up with a solution to that problem which some are calling overkill: arming our depth charges with low-yield nuclear bombs, to kill every submarine in the area regardless of changing depth."
 HIP_nuclear_land_mines:0 "Project TATZLWURM"
 HIP_nuclear_land_mines_desc:0 "Our pioneer corps could benefit from the recent explosion of new uses for nuclear technology. If we could engineer a safe, reliable demolition charge with a nuclear payload, it would make collapsing large buildings and clearing out the biggest minefields so much easier. They could also serve quite well as area-denial weapons."
 HIP_nuclear_naval_mines:0 "Project BARNACLE"
 HIP_nuclear_naval_mines_desc:0 "While it may seem insane to leave nuclear weapons floating around in the ocean, the fact is that a single naval mine, if equipped with a nuclear payload, can sink entire flotillas of enemy vessels, and can effectively deny a much larger area to the enemy since enemy vessels those far away from the blast could be damaged or sunk."
 HIP_nuclear_torpedos:0 "Project BARRACUDA"
 HIP_nuclear_torpedos_desc:0 "One obvious naval application of nuclear weapons is in torpedos. A torpedo tipped with a nuclear warhead, even a low-yield one, could effortlessly sink even the heaviest warships. With our recent advances in nuclear technology, this formidable new weapon may finally be in reach."
 HIP_nuclear_rocket_artillery:0 "Project TANKBUSTER"
 HIP_nuclear_rocket_artillery_desc:0 "Project TANKBUSTER aims to produce the smallest nuclear weapon yet: one capable of being fired out of a conventional rocket artillery system. The idea of equipping even our ground forces with nuclear weapons is tantalizing, although Terrafin is quick to point out the logistical and strategic limitations of such an endeavour. Still, if the project is successful its value in destroying armoured formations, area denial, attacking fortifications, and sheer Shock and Awe cannot be overstated."

 HIP_embolden_the_marksists_desc:0 "As Rosey Luxembark wrote in "On the Severyanan Revolution", either the most radical parts of a revolution will inevitably come to dominate, or the revolution will slide back into reaction and monarchism. There are a contingent of students who, despite being Marksists, restrict their demands to a democratic socialist state with a figurehead monarchy.

 ### EVENTS ###

 hippogriff.1.d: "A devastating hurricane with sustained winds over 220 kilometres per hour slammed into Hippogriffia from Warzena and Chiropterra, with the heaviest damage done to East Aris. Although our ability to shift between hippogriffs and seaponies let us avoid any deaths due to flooding, it provided no protection against the trees hurled through the air or the gusts slamming us into walls. The death toll is thankfully low, although the property damage is devastating. The economic impact of this disaster cannot yet be calculated, and many seaponies are using it as an evidence that the surface is too dangerous."
 hippogriff.1.a: "So much destruction..."

 hippogriff.100.t:0 "Zumidian Tank Trials"
 hippogriff.100.desc:0 "Over the past few weeks, the army has been trialling various proposals for tank designs in Zumidia. After our victory over the Storm King, the army searched for the latest advances in land warfare from around the world. Of particular interest was Stalliongrad's use of tanks during their revolution. Royal Island Arsenal has been hard at work developing a series of proposed tank designs and experimenting with how best to integrate them into our land forces. The original T1 prototype was scrapped early in development, but the T2 and T3 prototypes are looking promising.\n\nThe T2 is a small and fast light tank with a crew of four. It has 16mm of armour and a max speed of 72 km/h on roads. The T3, however, is the exact opposite. A joint collaboration with Equestria, the T3 is designed with a crew of ten and has a maximum speed of 10 km/h over roads. With seven guns, it is built to overwhelm the enemy with superior firepower as it advances with the infantry, rather than outmanoeuvring the enemy lines.\n\nA third contestant had also entered the trials; Cross Tide, an eccentric inventor and racing car driver, submitted his own design based purely on speed. While more lightly armoured than either the T2 or T3, Tide's tank supports a crew of two, it is armed with a 37mm cannon, and has an astonishing speed of 120 km/h on roads. However, army analysts are not confident that it could stand up to any form of anti-tank weapons that it would be liable to face.\n\nAs the trials conclude, a decision must be taken. Which design will the army adopt?"
 hippogriff.100.a:0 "The light tank should be our focus."
 hippogriff.100.b:0 "The heavy tank is the way to go."

 hipflavour.1.t:0 "Foreign Literature in Universities"
 hipflavour.1.desc:0 "Ever since we exposed ourselves to the outside world after our long sequester in Seaquestria, foreign products have been coming into Hippogriffia. Perhaps the most important of these are books, and the ideas they hold. From works of literature to science to philosophy, our younger generation are voraciously devouring this new reading material, and as they do so, they pick up some of these ideas and make them their own.\n\nOf greatest concern to us are the political ideas they have been absorbing: while Hippogriffia has always been a stable absolute monarchy, many among the younger generation are now discovering that there are other ways of organizing society, ranging from constitutionalism to republicanism to nationalism to even the most radical ideas, such as fascism and communism. Right now their curiosity is intellectual, but we know how fast these intellectual ideas can take hold, and the threat they could eventually pose to our rule."
 hipflavour.1.a:0 "We should keep an eye on this."

 hipflavour.2.t:0 "The Socialist and Liberal Clubs"
 hipflavour.2.desc:0 "New ideas are spreading across Hippogriffia, brought in by our renewed contact with the outside world. Clubs have formed discussing and spreading these ideas, which range from liberal ideas of free trade and representative government inspired by the Griffonian "three principles" to more radical ones, with some of these clubs even forming up around communist ideas imported from Stalliongrad, although none have yet called for anything like a revolution. Most of the membership of these clubs consist of curious young griffs prone to experimentation, as well as a few older ones who are dissatisfied with the monarchy and its handling of the Storm King's invasion."

 hipflavour.3.t:0 "The Aris First Committee"
 hipflavour.3.desc:0 "A group of veterans, protectionist economists, and community activists gathered together today to announce the formation of the Aris First Committee, a group "Dedicated to preserving traditional Hippogriffian values and protecting our economy from foreign takeover." The most prominent leaders were seapony Raft Wood, the Queen's former advisor who had first proposed the move to Seaquestria, and hippogriff flying ace Crack Lightning, who gave a patriotic speech at the opening of the committee:\n\n"Mount Aris stands tall, and like the mountain we must stand alone. We cannot depend on foreigners to help us, and neither should they depend on us. We have always been strong, self-sufficient, and proud of our cultures and traditions, and the Aris First committee will see that that stays true into the 11th century and beyond."\nHe was met with thunderous applause, and launched into the second half of his speech with even more vigor: "Liberal intellectuals would have us believe that harmony means opening our markets and our borders to everycreature, or funneling money and resources into charity projects in the North Zebrican Mandate. I believe harmony means a well-ordered, self-sufficient society that looks after its own. Aris First stands for the auto worker who is tired of seeing foreign cars drive their wages down, for the veteran tired of zebras accusing us of cowardice when we defeated the Storm King, for the small business owner tired of competing with foreign conglomerates who cheat the market. More than that, Aris First stands for our culture, our values, our history, and for a bright future for all Hippogriffia!"\n\nMany newspapers have denounced Aris First as xenophobic, backwards, or fearmongering. Still, their membership is quickly swelling, particularly in Seaquestria where seaponies see very little to gain from international trade, as there are few foreign products they want and many are concerned about underwater manufacturing being unable to compete with industrial giants in Equestria and Griffonia."
 hipflavour.3.a:0 "It's good to see them standing up for our values."
 hipflavour.3.b:0 "We must accept progress and not seek to shut out the world."

 hipflavour.4.t:0 "The First Socialist Conference"
 hipflavour.4.banned.desc:0 "Banning the socialist book clubs has not eliminated these ideas, it seems. Reports trickle in daily of these clubs organizing in the nooks and crannies of Seaquestria, and of more and more of our citizens gravitating towards this enticing "forbidden knowledge." From what little information we have on these meetings, their disdain for the government has grown since we banned them, and while they once talked of abstract ideals, they have now become more like conspiratorial groups plotting revolution.\n\nAmong the seaponies, the largest of these underground groups are anarchists, who call for a complete abolition of the state and claim to represent the "natural way of life of the seaponies," advocating for democratic non-hierarchical school-based living. Meanwhile, the most popular group among hippogriffs is a communist faction which emerged around a charismatic and eccentric seapony named Posada, who claims that Hippogriffia is uniquely suited to achieving "a post-scarcity society" but only if it is revolutionized into a dictatorship of the proletariat.\n\nRecently, we have received a tipoff that the anarchists and communists are planning a conference to debate their ideas and form a coalition, presumably with the aim of combining their forces for some plot against the government."
 hipflavour.4.desc:0 "The socialist book clubs have begun spreading outside the universities, as idealistic students try to spread their ideas among the general populace. While many of these groups profess "harmonic socialist" and "democratic socialist" ideals and want to work with the government to implement socialist economics in Hippogriffia, there is an undercurrent of sedition in these groups, as they all want at least as much devolution of power away from the monarchy as the liberals do.\n\nMore alarmingly, some of these groups openly call for the complete transformation of Hippogriffia. These more radical groups are gaining popularity among the poorer seaponies and hippogriffs who are skeptical of the possibility of reform. The largest of these radicals among the seaponies are anarchists, who call for a complete abolition of the state and claim to represent the "natural way of life of the seaponies," advocating for democratic non-hierarchical school-based living.\n\nMeanwhile, the most popular group among hippogriffs is a communist faction which emerged around a charismatic and eccentric seapony named Posada, who claims that Hippogriffia is uniquely suited to achieving a "post-scarcity society" but only if it is transformed into a revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat.\n\nWhile these groups are currently small, their membership is rapidly growing, and news has reached us that they are planning a conference to debate their ideas and form a coalition of some kind, presumably organized around whichever faction's ideas prove most persuasive."

 hippogriff.16.t:0 "Crack Lightning Returns"
 hippogriff.16.desc:0 "Aviator and Storm War hero Crack Lightning touched down at Queen Novo Airport this morning to an awaiting crowd of reporters and fans. His trusty custom-built aeroplane, the Spirit of Starfield, gleamed in the morning light as it taxied to its parking spot. His three-month solo tour of the world has been the talk of Hippogriffia, with many wondering what he'd discover beyond the borders of the island. His words to a reporter from Aris Post have been reprinted in numerous outlets, and his celebrity has turned them into a rallying cry for the isolationist elements within Hippogriffia:\n\n"There are many great sights in the wider world, Karthin chief among them, but I must say on the whole, the Storm King's barbarism is the rule rather than the exception outside of our fair nation. They have very little to offer us except for endless 'isms': communism, liberalism, republicanism, all ideas which griffons and even ponies kill each other over every day. We need to remain strong in the face of this violent new world, and reject these foreign ideas which would disrupt our peaceable way of life.""

The Director was quite sympathetic to their case, as ever since they opened up their country they have been inundated with fascist, communist and other anti-harmonic radicals trying to spread their ideologies and undermine one of the few harmonist states in North Zebrica.\n\nThey requested we share our experience combatting communist influence in Rijekograd, as well as conduct joint training exercises for their agents to better prepare them to nip subversive activity in the bud.

In his letter to us, Director Arclight praised the AHAC's efforts at securing Hippogriffia against subversion. His letter also contained the first of hopefully many lessons from the OHS, gleaned from many years of combating communism in Rijekograd. He warned us was to stay vigilant against all forms of socialism, even so-called moderates, stating that "Behind every Nova Whirl there is a Caramel Haze. Behind every so-called 'Democratic Socialist' there is a tyrannical overlord waiting to be unleashed." Violet Facade read this out before the committee, which has taken this warning to heart."

 hippogriff.4.t:0 "The OHS Rejects our Request"

The committee has elected to thank Director Arclight for his consideration, but not to push the issue further as it is clear that his mind is made up."

Citing concerns about growing communist and fascist influence in Hippogriffia, as well as the threat of infiltration from foreign powers, they have requested to coordinate a program where their "Anti-Harmonic Activities Committee" would share intelligence and training with SMILE. Director Bon Bon is entusiastic about this plan, saying that it is just as important to protect harmony in Hippogriffia as it is in Equestria, but Princess Twilight Sparkle has expressed some reservations. She sees some of the AHAC's actions, such as the censoring of books, as unacceptably stifling to learning and damaging to the trust between Queen Novo and her subjects.

In it, she expresses concern over some of the book bans the AHAC has issued, stating that: "Harmony and knowledge go claw-in-fin, and harmony requires governing with a light hoof and trusting your subjects. However good the intentions behind it, the AHAC's activities undermine that trust. Therefore, [EQS.GetLeader] has regretfully declined your request to share intelligence between SMILE and the Anti-Harmonic Activities Committee."\n\nThis comes as a great disappointment to the AHAC, whose chairpony Violet Facade expected our friends in Equestria to enthusiastically support our fight against extremism in Hippogriffia."

They cite Wingbardy as "a hotbed of socialist and fascist radicalism," paying particular attention to the doctrines of Beakolini and the way supposedly-apolitical Wingbardian literature subtly advances fascist ideology.\n\nThis move has been met with condemnation from a singularly unexpected source: while Raft Wood and most of the rest of Aris First have praised the move as "the first step in freeing our culture from foreign influence," Crack Lightning has criticized the ban, arguing that Wingbardian books are no more dangerous than any other, that the ban is poorly worded, and that it rests on an idea of so-called "Crypto-fascism" which he finds preposterous. His voice is joined by the usual choir of progressive harmonists who oppose the AHAC, with Silverstream and Skystar both urging Queen Novo to rein in the AHAC, seeing the ban as yet another example of an escalating trend of xenophobia within the committee, with Skystar being particularly passionate about not wanting to go back to the lonely days of hiding from the world."

Some more cautious elements within our military have cautioned that this would necessitate sharing classified information with the Hippogriffs and could end up costing a significant amount of money.

 hippogriff.17.desc:0 "Queen Novo's niece Silverstream has denounced the AHAC's move to expand coverage to foreign nationals today, saying that it's "Stupid and wrong and not Harmony" to impose our values and laws upon others, and that it "Treats creatures who should be our friends with suspicion and fear." Aris First founder Raft Wood has praised the move as "The first step in removing foreign influence from our Mountain," lending credence to Silverstream's statements that the AHAC is turning into a weapon of xenophobia.\n\nAHAC chairpony Violet Facade insists her fears are overblown, and that the measure is primarily intended to combat tax evasion, pointing to the AHAC's fining of businessgriff Plumage Moonfeather for hiding money with his New Mareland associates, which would not have been possible without the new measure."

 hippogriff.18.t:0 "What is "Harmony"?"
 hippogriff.18.desc:0 "After weeks of deliberation, the AHAC proposed their definition of Harmony to Queen Novo to be signed into law. Progressives opposed setting down a legal definition of Harmony as being against the spirit of Harmony, with Skystar and Silverstream begging the Queen not to "Put Harmony in a cage of ink and paper." Meanwhile, the Aris First movement largely endorsed the move, with Raft Wood proclaiming his full confidence in Violet Facade's judgement and expertise. Queen Novo decided to at least give it a read before making a decision. The report addressed each Element of Harmony in turn:\n\nLoyalty, contrary to the Equestrian understanding, was about pride in your home and loyalty to the Queen and Hippogriffian Harmony itself, not about your personal friends.\nHonesty is more than telling the truth. It was also about behaving in an upright and correct manner for your station.\nGenerosity is when well-off creatures willingly used their wealth to help their country and those less fortunate, and is thus incompatible with forced wealth redistribution.\nMagic is not only magic, but the pursuit of excellence in all of one's talents.\nLaughter and Kindness, being altogether too vague to be given a rigorous legal definition, should be considered secondary Elements.\n\nThe report concluded that under the definition, Hippogriffia should stop looking to Equestria and especially to Griffonian republicans, liberals, social democrats, and other false-Harmonists for guidance, as these were all either too laissez-faire, too individualistic, or too focused on anti-harmonic notions of constitutionalism or economic redistribution to truly understand Harmony as we do.\n\nNovo set the report down, declaring:"

Crack was charming, debonnaire, and clearly in a good mood, gushing about the new law the AHAC had been drafting.\n\n"You've truly outdone yourself," he said, "The AHTA is exactly what this country needs to remind us of who we are, what we stand for, and who our enemies are."\n"I don't know, I thought it was fairly mundane."\n"Oh don't sell yourself short!" Crack exclaimed, "Take ah, paragraph three, section four of the current draft. It's brilliant. 'Any creature who publicly propagates false or misrepresented statements which they know or should reasonably be expected to know will undermine the public's faith in the fundamental institutions of Hippogriffia will be considered culpable in any resultant unrest or anti-Harmonic activity.' Just that section alone will allow us to uproot all those unpatriotic and anti-Harmonist elements easily! Plus the way paragraph two lets you cut through all those messy police jurisdictions and procedures to ensure that the ones who truly deserve it face justice."\n\nViolet sipped her coffee. She didn't like the twinkle she saw in the hippogriff's eye, and slowly opened her beak:\n"Well, uh, Crack, it does require the statement to be false..."\nHe waved a claw dismissively. "Or misleading, or misleading! You underestimate your own genius, Ms. Facade!"\n\nAfter Crack had left, Violet thought long and hard on what he'd said. She'd never intended to write a law with such ruthless implications, but it seemed she'd done just that. Lightning's enthusiasm unsettled her. He reminded her of the demagogues and dictators of Griffonia, going on about unpatriotic elements and lambasting due process as a barrier to "true justice." Despite her doubts, some part of her didn't care if Crack Lightning liked it or not. The AHTA would be a powerful tool, and in the fins of a responsible leader, a tool for good."

This body, unique in Hippogriffia's history, has the power to draft and pass legislation, though the Queen possesses an absolute veto. Delegates from across Hippogriffia gathered in a new meeting hall on Mount Aris. As the Queen gave the opening address, the energy in the hall was enthusiastic, but also a bit tense. Rumors had spread claiming that radical Aris First members or leftist agitators planned to disrupt the session. Many also feared that unresolved tensions between Hippogriff and Seapony delegates were going to flare up.\n\nIn the end, the session was disrupted by something entirely unexpected. One delegate, clearly bored by the opening speeches, began loudly humming to himself. This annoyed the delegate seated beside him, who suddenly took the floor and proposed a measure banning "humming, mumbling and other distracting behavior" during parliamentary sessions. The humming delegate, now offended, took the floor to defend his conduct and argue that the measure violated the delegates' liberties. Several delegates, each eager to make a name for themselves, followed by giving increasingly impassioned speeches either supporting or opposing the measure.\n\nThis continued until Princess Skystar, also in attendance, asked to be allowed to speak. She chided the delegates for focusing on pointless minutiae while serious issues required consideration, and reminded them that creatures everywhere were depending on them for assistance. This rebuke seemed to snap the delegates back to attention, and the rest of the session focused on more consequential issues. In spite of this incident, many remain hopeful that the Royal Parliament will show the benefits democratization can bring to Hippogriffia's government."

Now the council has been revived, with its membership consisting mostly of political newcomers. The councilors met in a hall on Mount Aris with Queen Novo, members of the extended royal family, and many eager spectators in attendance.\n\nUnfortunately, the inexperience of the new councilors created unforeseen problems. Many of them appeared absolutely starstruck in the presence of the Queen and other royals, and their opening speeches contained nothing but excessive praise for Her Majesty's Government. The councilors continued in this manner until Silverstream suddenly turned towards the Queen and blurted out, "I'm confused! If they only wanted to flatter you, couldn't they have just sent in fan mail?"\n\nAfter a brief silence, Queen Novo began to laugh, as did the councilors. This moment seemed to break the ice, and the councilors then spoke on several local and national issues they wished to bring to the government's attention. The Queen listened attentively to each of their speeches and promised that her government would work to address all of their concerns. Though the Queen still rules in Hippogriffia, she is always looking for input from her subjects."

But if things went wrong today... he didn't want to think about it.\n\nTerramar perked up as he heard Sky Beak return. His face was ashen, and he couldn't seem to look Terramar in the eye. "I don't know how to tell you this, but the congress voted for secession. You're going to have to decide who you want to live with. Like I said before, no matter what you choose remember that I will always..."\n\nBefore he could finish, Terramar bolted out of the room. Laying in bed, he stared up at the ceiling and cried."

She'd seen it unprepared in the face of foreign invasion, humiliated by forced exile in Seaquestria, and triumphant in the final battle with the Storm King. She'd seen it struggle in tough times and prosper in times of plenty, but she'd never seen it like this.\n\nAcross her realm, Hippogriffs and Seaponies variously blamed her, her government, her military and each other for the country's defeat. There was sedition in the press and violence in the streets. Some even had the gall to call for immediate secession. That could not and would not be allowed to happen.\n\nIn a meeting with her cabinet, Queen Novo discussed the steps that had to be taken to weather this storm. She would invoke the same emergency measures used during the migration to Seaquestria and suspend due process. The press would be censored and the army would mobilize to restore order in the streets. After the meeting concluded, the Queen found Skystar in her room. The Princess sat in stunned silence as the Queen explained her plan. "Mother!" she exclaimed, "how could you do such things!?"\n\n"I am doing what must be done! There is no other way to save our realm. I know that I will be called a tyrant by many, maybe even by you.

Among the latter were Silverstream and her brother Terramar, browsing the few shops still open near the city center.\n\n"Silverstream, it's getting late, don't you think we should head back now?"\nSilverstream pouted as she replied, "Oh, come on! Why is it a crime to stay out past sunset!? I know things are bad right now, but the Queen's new policies seem a tiny bit excessive."\n\n"Yeah, the press censorship and mass arrests might be an overreaction," Terramar looked towards the palace, where a crowd of angry Hippogriffs was confronting a police barricade, some even throwing rocks. "But at least the curfew is working. That crowd was twice as large earlier today."\n\nOne of the policegriffs suddenly collapsed after several rocks struck his head. This was the last straw for the police, and they soon brought out a large fire hose. The siblings looked on in astonishment as the police turned on the water and sprayed directly into the crowd.\n\nThe scene quickly descended into chaos as the crowd dispersed in every direction. Silverstream and Terramar managed to duck into a nearby alleyway and catch their breath.\n"I can't believe it..." Silverstream said, her eyes wide with fear.\n"I know," replied Terramar, struggling to keep his voice steady, "I never imagined I'd see things like this here...

 hippogriff.51.d:0 ""The Right to Truth Removed!" the morning papers cried after the arrest of a notable journalist.\n\nThis outcry was followed by a series of protests calling for the repeal of the Anti-Harmonic Terrorism Act (AHTA). This piece of legislation grants the government the power to, among other provisions, arrest any individual who instigated unrest or other "anti-Harmonic activities" by publicly disseminating "false or misrepresented" statements that, in turn, undermine the institutions of Hippogriffia.\n\nThe recent bout of unrest began when a journalist uncovered the conditions prisoners endured in Hippogriffian POW camps during the war. To call the accommodations "horrible" would be an understatement. Prisoners were forced to live in hastily constructed hostels which were unheated and in poor condition, leaving them to the mercy of the weather. They were malnourished and received medical care only when in their deathbeds. In short, their circumstances were nightmarish and hidden away from the public eye, until an intrepid journalist brought the facts to light.\n\nThe journalist was arrested when he made his findings public, leading to massive protests around the nation calling for his release and the law's repeal. Some members of the government believe that the protestors' demands should be met, most notably Azrael. "This vile act goes against everything a Harmonic society stands for!" he proclaimed during a recent rally. "The truth must always be sought out, for it shall set you free! And how can we call ourselves practitioners of Harmony if we are not free?"\n\nHowever, not all share these views. "Violet Facade made the right decision when she promulgated this law. Without it, Hippogriffia would have no defense against traitors who seek to do her harm" Crack Lightning, a vocal member of Aris First, stated at a press conference.\n\nWhatever the government decides, it will have serious consequences for Hippogriffian society."

Swift Claw had been glad to answer at first, enthusiastic even, but as time wore on it became clear Silverstream would never stop asking. It reminded him of his three year old daughter. Swift Claw had become increasingly convinced that the new "Royal Friendship Advisor" was as useless as she was annoying.\n\nAs her tour finally concluded and Swift Claw bade her farewell, Silverstream announced that she'd thought of at least three changes which could be made to "make the whole place more friendly," and said they'd be hearing from her soon. Getting back to his coworkers for coffee, Swift Claw was surprised to hear them all talking about Silverstream: how friendly she was, how appreciated they felt when she came to them, how her questions made them feel like somegriff actually cared about what they were doing. How they hoped their kids grew up to be as kind and thoughtful as her. When Swift Claw mentioned how she'd said she was going to change their workplace, they all agreed that whatever she suggested would definitely make things better.

They'd spent so long worried this communist was coming for their heads, but now that they finally met her she was just another dorky, enthusiastic seapony like Skystar herself.

Whatever it was, it was always something, and while we struggled and fought and sometimes failed, the rich kids would cruise on by like it was nothing."\n\nSkybolt let the anger he'd felt for so long propel him further: "I made it. I was lucky. But so many others didn't. And you know what? I shouldn't have to become an officer to make more than a pittance. You shouldn't have to be brilliant to live a good life, because the navy needs sailors just as much as it needs officers. And we have the capacity!

She knew the professional thing would be to stay in one spot, and that she should probably be in hippogriff form, but she was simply too giddy to stay still, and she wanted to experience this wonderful day in the form she preferred. Posada began her speech, her lure bobbing in front of her as she gushed to the crowd:\n\n"Comrades of the Supreme Workers' Council, I could not be more pleased to see you all here. Today, we've taken the first step to making our dreams a reality, and have boldly entered a new era. The revolution has truly begun, here in Hippogriffia! And I am honoured to accept the position of General Secretary, and swear to do my duty to the revolution, to bring about a new world from the ashes of the old. As my first act, I would like to call a vote to rename our country to something that better reflects its true purpose and character. When I look around I see not only hippogriffs, but also ponies, seaponies and zebras. I propose that this be the inaugural meeting of the Supreme Workers' Council of Revolutionary North Zebrica, to better reflect our aims and our makeup.""

 hippocommie.3.d:0 "Posada sat in her office with a list of names before her. The material conditions in North Zebrica made it so that the purges necessary for the establishment of Stalliongrad and most other communist states were unnecessary here, but the revolution wouldn't be totally bloodless. The names before her, twelve in all, were the worst of the reactionaries: the imperialists. A small group of warmongers who wanted to go out and conquer other nations and crush their creatures over some ridiculous theory of Hippogriff supremacy or a sheer lust for conquest.\n\nPosada's own body bore the scars of imperialism: her time imprisoned on one of the Storm King's airships had taught her to loathe them, and the writings of Caramel Marks had given her words to express that revulsion. Colonel Razorbeak, Director Solid Stone, all the others: these twelve had wanted to use their positions in the military and government to make Hippogriffia as vile as the Storm King. Posada had already gotten the Supreme Workers' Council's authorization to deal with them, and there would be no half-measures. Next to the orders which would end these twelve lives was a letter, written by her old friend Crack Lightning. They had drifted apart thanks to his involvement with Aris First, but the war hero had written to her as a friend, pleading her to spare them. Posada picked up her pen. Would imprisonment suffice, or would she turn to the bullet?"

She'd invited Skystar to speak with her, and had gotten some tea for the two of them. She paced about her office, checking the clock constantly until, two minutes after the scheduled time, she heard a knock on her door.\n\nSkystar walked in, wearing her communist party uniform with the same dignity with which she wore her old royal garb. Without a word she took a seat in front of Posada's desk, forcing the General Secretary to scurry to her own seat and sit down after her.\n\n"How is the revolution progressing, comrade Posada?" Skystar asked with stiff formality, pouring them each a cup of tea. Posada was flustered, taking a long sip of the mango-flavoured liquid to buy time. While she thought of her response, something cracked in Skystar's expression and she launched into a bubbly series of questions:\n\n"Did I get it right? Cuz like the revolution only started with overthrowing us right, cuz like you need to do so much work to build the new society and all? That's how that works right? We're still in a revolution right?"\n\nPosada spat out her tea. Once she'd finished laughing, she regained some of her composure and answered:\n\n"Well, yes! Yes that's exactly right. No hard feelings about the overthrowing part?"\n\n"Oh, many hard feelings! I was angrier than I've been in... well, ever. But those are in the past, and I've seen what you've been doing. I want to be part of it, if you'll have me."\n\n"Of course we'll have you!" Posada paused, chuckling to herself. "You know, when I was planning the revolution, I never expected I'd end up having a tea party with the princess."\n\n"Wait, did you just make me princess again?"\n\n"N- no, I mean-"\n\n"Well then it's just tea with a comrade, right?""

As a connoisseur of torture, Autumn Breeze, hopefully you'll get to enjoy the special feeling of being one of the first subjects of a new method."\n"The situation is simple, fillies and gentlecolts.

We don't know the precise effects, but they should be very interesting. I'm sure you'll have plenty of time to contemplate them yourselves."\nThe doors slammed open, and a breathless Skystar rushed in, her eyes bloodshot and watery. "Don't do it, Posada! They might be evil... they might be monsters... they might even deserve it... but lowering yourself to their level would make you a monster too!"\n"The Supreme Workers' Council has voted to leave their fate up to me, Skystar," Posada replied coolly. "And they're going to get what they deserve."\nSkystar dropped to the floor. "Look at them, Posada! They're helpless prisoners. What you're about to do to them is the kind of thing THEY do, not us! Remember about how you spared my family? How you didn't have the capitalists shot? Please, I'm begging you - don't corrupt yourself with torture! Do you want to have that stain on your soul for the rest of your life?"\n"You feel strongly about this?" Posada inquired.\n"More so than anything since Hard Line tried to kill my mother," she whispered. "Please. Just shoot them."\nPosada frowned. As it was in her claws, she could choose to only have them shot, showing mercy to monsters who didn't deserve it. Or she could go ahead with the plan, and risk losing Skystar as a friend.

 hippocommie.7.t:0 "The Fate of Chiropterra"
 hippocommie.7.d:0 "Posada hadn't slept in almost two days. The presidium had been endlessly debating what to do with the Chiropterran occupation zone, with the proposals getting more and more desperate as new facts about Chiropterra came to light. This was a society engineered from the ground up for a thousand years to be as ruthless as possible, arranged in a vast stratocracy. Given their crimes and the depth of their hatred for their occupiers, incorporating Chiropterra as an ordinary administrative region was out of the question. Whichever option was adopted, it would take generations to fully uproot the Chiropterran system, which had taken root in the minds of every Chiropterran citizen even with their government gone. Three proposals lay before the presidium, each sickening in its own way.\nThe first would represent a concession to absolute evil. There were two Chiropterran Moonspeakers, two out of the entire country, who had somehow twisted the Nightmarist faith into something resembling liberation theology. Posada could withdraw the majority of the occupation force and put these two in charge, although in order to administer Chiropterra they would have to use much of the old power structure, which meant letting war criminals return to their old jobs and potentially setting Chiropterra up to rise again and exact revenge.\nThe second proposal would mean remaining in the Chiropterran quagmire for generations. The creatures of Chiropterra would be mostly spared death, but the Nightmarist faith would be completely banned, even in its most casual incarnations, and the entire population of Chiropterra would have to attend reeducation camps, where the next generation would learn of the evils of the Chiropterran system so that they might grow up better than their parents. This was guaranteed to be met with massive resistance and endless insurgencies, but its proponents argued that the first plan was naive and the third plan monstrous.\nThe third option was genocide. Justice would be applied in its harshest form, with everyone above the rank of sergeant immediately shot. A blue terror of massive proportions would erase Chiropterra, with those who were not shot put into permanent reeducation camps. It was horrific, it was bloodier than even the Storm King's methods, but it would finally destroy one of the most evil nations in the world."

 hippocommie.8.d:0 "The most nauseating crimes Chiropterra committed were done by their medical science division, the LMRD. Now that this data is in our claws, we have to decide what to do with it. While the methods were monstrous, they advanced medical science years ahead of us, and a group of former Harmonists have persuasively argued that it would be a crime against their victims to burn the information they gathered on Polio, Malaria, and a dozen other diseases which could save so many lives. More controversial are the military applications of their research. While their combat drugs were undeniably effective, many of them were temperamental, and we only have a vague understanding of how they work since so many of their records were destroyed. Adopting these would mean turning our own soldiers into the lab rats of Chiropterra's worst, even from beyond the grave. Still, Terrafin and many others in our own military science division have urged us to put aside these qualms and use these military applications, as doing so would make our troops more effective and almost certainly save lives.\n\nFinally, an even more controversial option has been proposed: Chiropterran scientists advanced medical science immensely, and with the destruction of so many records, much of their data only exists in their heads. Certain technocratic elements have suggested that by offering amnesty to a mere half-dozen of Chiropterra's monsters, we could advance our own medical research dramatically. They would be kept on a tight leash, and obviously we would not let them use their old methods, but there is some appeal to putting these evil minds to work building a better world. Terrafin as well as numerous others have objected to this idea, stating that they do not wish to work with such creatures and that offering them amnesty would sully their entire department."

Prototypes included triple-barreled rifles, fletchette guns, caseless ammunition, and all manner of other methods to increase rate of fire, all with the goal of creating a rifle that could fire off a burst of three to five rounds before the recoil from the first shot was felt.

With added weight from snorkels, fully-sealed armor, and an amphibious engine, anything short of the solid basalt of the ocean floor will be unable to support it, making it rather useless for amphibious assaults. Terrafin has suggested that we take the extensive data from the project and apply it to a more traditional super-heavy tank, as without all the extra weight and complexity he could design a good tank, but some within the project insist that the concept is possible. In particular they point to the double-tread idea which performed well in models but has not been rigorously tested and would take extensive redesigning."

The rifle of the revolution will no longer fire lead or steel slugs, but finned sub-calibre darts made of pure tungsten. The new rifle can achieve incredible rates of fire, pierce enchanted griffonian armor, and in larger calibres even punch through light tank armor! Comrade Posada was thrilled to learn that it also had far greater range underwater than any conventional or magical rifle, and has ordered the rollout of the newly-named 'Caramel-pattern Flechette Rifles' to all branches of our infantry. The cost of the ammunition, being made of tungsten and soon perhaps even depleted uranium, would be prohibitive had we not already abolished money!"
 hippocommie.11.d_caseless:0 "Caseless ammunition has many benefits, including lightening the load carried by each soldier, but our chemists had difficulty creating a material that would both hold the bullet in place and act as a propellant while not being prohibitively difficult to manufacture.\n\nThe solution came from an unexpected source: a chemistry graduate student named Carlos Gonzalez, who was working as a lab assistant on the project, applied a bit of Zumidian alchemy to the problem and finally created a formula which worked. Terrafin has already named the first working caseless firearm the 'Gonzalez-pattern light machinegun.' Terrafin recommends the new ammunition be rolled out as soon as possible, since it halves the weight of ammunition and turns the weapon into a beautiful closed system with no ejection ports to allow dust in, and no material wasted. Full adoption will take years given the lack of backwards compatibility, but the 'Gonzalez' is already proving a hit with troops, especially ammunition carriers."

Such weapons are, so far, the only method of reliably delivering strategic nuclear weapons, despite the promise of ICBMs continuing to grow. But there are three competing proposals before the General Secretary's desk, and only one can be chosen.\n\nThe first proposal, lead by old Air Force generals, suggests strongly incentivizing the growth of strategic bombers through major research grants. These would largely stick to established wisdom and not risk major changes.\n\nThe second proposal offers experimental improvements to designs, focused around achieving more lift with bigger bomb bays at a greater range. Terrafin has signed his name to this project, believing it is likely to succeed and will prove highly valuable.\n\nThe third proposal argues that enemy interception technology is too advanced and a totally new design is required to stab into the heart of enemy airspace. By flying higher than enemy interceptors can reach at Mach 3, it will be able to deliver nuclear payloads with safety anywhere. This so-called "deep-penetration bomber" would likely prove massively expensive and fuel-hungry, but proponents argue such costs are well worth it."

The most successful of these has been a group of more progressive-minded harmonists, spearheaded by Silverstream, who have petitioned to form a Harmonic Socialist wing of the RWP.\n\nWhile they supported the monarchy against our revolution, they argue that there is strong compatibility between the ideals of harmony and the aims of communism, citing the works of Karamelka Sladkaya and Vasiliy Pantsushenko which praise the values of friendship and harmony even while they denounce capitalism for failing to live up to these values. Silverstream in particular spoke of the optimism she shares with Posada's followers, and argues that we should put aside our differences with the harmonists and work together to create a better future for all creatures."

The RWP-A is also likely to advocate for more moderate foreign policy than Posada's, as they primarily consist of seaponies who still tend to be more isolationist than the fervent internationalists who make up the majority of the RWP, and see far less to gain from military intervention."

While few took the nationalist's word for it, he protested that "Beakolini himself went from being a socialist to being a nationalist, so why can't I do the opposite?"\n\nEven with this alleged conversion, the "National Communists" have voiced their opposition to the mainstream RWP's internationalism, arguing that other races and societies are too backwards to achieve communism in a "civilized manner" as we have.

We can hardly say that we are sweeping aside the old world if we allow not only capitalists but the royalty themselves to swim among us. We allowed rightist temerity to win out that day, and so I move to reopen the issue of Queen Novo, and suggest we follow what every successful revolution has done and have the primary symbol of reaction in Revolutionary North Zebrica executed immediately."\n\nPosada glanced at Skystar, noticing the young commissar had started to cry even as Hard Line was met with boos and hisses by most of the Workers' Council. Posada had to shut this down at once, and addressed him from across the room:\n\n"Comrades, please! Do not boo him, engage with him. Now, remember Caramel Marks said that it is a sign of weakness of a people to hold their enemy at their mercy and not exact revenge."\n\n"Exactly General Secretary, it was a moment of weakness-"\n\n"Wait!" interrupted Posada, "I am so sorry, esteemed comrades, that wasn't Caramel Marks, that was Beakolini." She heard a tiny giggle coming from Skystar, and continued, launching into a tirade at the momentarily dumbstruck Hard Line: "This body already made its decision, and it was in a moment of courage and clarity, not 'rightist cowardice.'

The message she was greeted with was nothing she had expected.\n\n"My friends," came the voice of the infamous radical Moonspeaker Dusk Wane, "It is time for us to leave our mistakes behind us. I have spoken with the communist leaders, and they have agreed to withdraw their forces and provide amnesty for those still fighting in the hills, so long as we accept our crimes and move forward to build a better Chiropterra."\n\nGuava Drop hissed, but Silver Spike shushed him. She'd always been at least slightly sympathetic to Dusk Wane's message, even if he did border on heresy.\n\n"We have been lost, my friends, for a very long time. I have been to old Tzinacatlia; our true faith is one of sharing, and tolerance of difference.

She knew death would come for her, and was ready to face it with dignity. Then she heard Guava Drop whimpering, and glanced behind her to see that her foals had disobeyed her and come out of hiding. All of her strength vanished.\n\n"What about my foals?" she whispered to the hippogriffs, "Will they be taken care of?

This is compounded by the appallingly-poor accuracy of the design, which is inaccurate and short-ranged even compared to standard rocket artillery.

Look at the evidence for UFOs. Look at the evidence for advanced technology used to build the pyramids of Maregypt. Look at the evidence for rare psionic talent. Look at the evidence for life-seeding. Consider all of it, taken together, as one!"\n\n"What evidence?!" the reporter demanded. "The visions in your head?"\n\nPosada smiled bemusedly.

While Posada vigorously argued for The Internationale, which she said reflected the dreams of liberation for every worker, two other songs garnered substantial approval among the deelgates.\n\nThe first, the aggressive "The People's War," had a substantial appeal among the more militaristic elements of the RWP, and its upbeat and bombastic rhythm has made it a favourite among many hippogriffs outside the party. It is also a new song, composed in Hippogriffia itself as part of the new musical movements which have sprung up after our revolution, as opposed to the Internationale which is more of a classic.\n\nThe other proposal is called "Fourteen minutes to launch," and reflects the dreams of spaceflight which have gripped many of the younger and more technologically-minded communists. With that said, others have dismissed it as effectively putting the entire nation's hopes on technocratic cliques, as ultiamtely only a very few will be involved in any space program, and it is still an open question whether one will ever succeed.\n\nThe debate raged well into the night, but in the end, the Supreme Workers' Council came to a decision."

These things are real, they are here, and they have been here for quite some time." She took a bite of kelp. "As of now, every file we have on these, as well as all reports we've collected from foreign newspapers, are publicly available at the Hall of Records. These things have been spotted by pilots and astronomers, police officers and politicians. They have been confirmed on RADAR from multiple stations. Similar sightings, of flying wheels of fire, date back thousands of years."\n\nShe took a deep breath. "I wish I could say these things were the space comrades we've been awaiting. Unfortunately, we simply don't know. They may be spirits taking physical form, ley lines twisted into knots, time travelers, experimental craft tested by another nation, something else yet, or multiple of the above. Of course they may also be our extraterrestrial comrades come to visit. If they are, however they have not yet revealed themselves to us. If you have ever seen one of these things, be it a disk-shaped craft, a light in the sky, or even another form, please report it! We are very interested in learning about the truth of these unknown craft. Remember, comrades:""

The XB-70 Valkyrie's bomb bay is smaller than a B-52 Stratofortress, it has less range, and it is far, far more labor-intensive to produce and guzzles fuel like no plane before. The XB-70 will not replace the B-52, but it will complement it and serve missions the Stratofortress cannot.

When a successor needed to be chosen, he threw his hat into the ring because he didn't think the other contenders would fund his research. Now he wished more than anything for a break from his new responsibilities. Luckily, there was a proposal on his desk that might give him just that.\n\nAcross from him sat a researcher from the computer science division, eager to hear his thoughts. In front of him was a study which found that local governments that incorporated computers into their operations saw their efficiency increase exponentially. The study recommended that computers be integrated into all government functions, from routine paperwork to decision making at the highest levels. It even speculated that computers may eventually make government by living creatures obsolete.\n\n"It's an interesting idea," Terrafin said, finally breaking the silence, "but I'm not sure how practical it is. The idea that computers can rule us is going to meet with opposition. Many creatures won't put their trust in machines."\n\nThe researcher's face lit up. "Trust is exactly why we need the computers. As scary as rule by machines is in the abstract, there's nothing scarier than being ruled by other creatures. History shows us that even the most ardent revolutionaries can become tyrants once in power. And after... recent events, the people's trust in their politicians has already been shaken."\n\nTerrafin winced at the allusion to the previous General Secretary. As he contemplated the idea further, he began to see its potential. Computers couldn't be corrupt or abuse their power, so relying on them was the logical choice.

Hard Line had always been particularly fond of this quote. It occasionally inspired him to leave the comfort of his office and walk amongst the people, in order to better express their will.\n\nThe streets of the capital were crowded, but all creatures quickly cleared the way as the General Secretary and his guards approached. Hard Line observed his surroundings with smug satisfaction. On almost every street there was construction. New factories, hospitals and schools went up every day. The people were healthy and prosperous, and there were no beggars in sight. Society had come a long way since the early days of the revolution.\n\nThe early days... Hard Line frowned, remembering Posada's rule. He had once considered her a comrade, but as events progressed she rebuked, scorned and mocked his every proposal. He had endured all her denunciations because he knew she was wrong. She polluted and deformed Marksism by tolerating revisionists.\n\nNow she was gone, and he had finally set things right. By destroying the revisionists, he had purified the party and secured the state. Thanks to his efforts, the revolution would last beyond eternity!\n\nAs Hard Line passed by, those who saw him felt either terror or thinly veiled contempt. Almost all of them knew someone who had been executed, sent to a labor camp, or simply disappeared. Not even in their wildest nightmares had they imagined the purges would go so far.\n\nA few onlookers worked up enough courage to shout insults at Hard Line. He ignored them.

 hippocommie.87.d:0 "Skybolt Spear had never been great with speeches, yet he found himself having to make them more and more. As he rose through the ranks of the Blue Navy, each promotion required a new round of orations to the sailors and officers. Now that his sense of duty had led him to the General Secretary's chair, it seemed like public speaking was all he did. Despite this constant practice, he never seemed to get any better at addressing a crowd.\n\nLuckily today's speech would be simple. He had been invited to attend the launching ceremony of the Navy's newest ship. Surrounded by sailors and steel hulls, he would be in his element.\n\nAs the new ship's captain finished speaking, Skybolt took his place at the podium. In his claws he held notecards with prepared remarks, written to be short and sweet. He looked up at the new vessel. "Isn't she a beauty? Brand new and state of the art. Here's to you captain, I'm sure you and your crew will make us proud..."\n\nSkybolt turned his gaze to the audience and froze. The crowd was much larger than expected, and none of them looked happy to see him. Militaristic officers glared, furious at him for ending Posada's most brutal policies. Harmonist sympathizers looked disappointed, feeling he hadn't gone far enough. Many others simply looked concerned for the future. Skybolt had to think fast. He tore up his notecards and took a deep breath.\n\n"And when you think about it, this ship is a lot like the revolution. As it sails its crew will make plenty of missteps and have many disagreements. And they will face many challenges: rough seas, storms, maybe even enemy attacks. But in spite of all these dangers from within and without, the ship will persevere. The revolution will carry on much the same, because like the crew we're all in this together. No matter what happens, we will all do our best to create a better world!"\n\nThese remarks appeared to satisfy the crowd. Many clapped, a few even cheered. Skybolt breathed a sigh of relief and returned to his seat."

He eventually became curious enough to arrange a meeting, and what he found surprised him. She was hopelessly idealistic, but she had passion and determination that seemed almost supernatural.\n\nWith boundless enthusiasm, she had led the revolution to victory and spread it across North Zebrica. When tough decisions needed to be made, she had done what was necessary to protect Hippogriffia and its people. Yet her nature was so trusting that vile, manipulative traitors had made her doubt herself and now... now she was gone. Now it was Crack's job to pick up the pieces.\n\nThe office of the General Secretary was abuzz with activity. A uniformed officer approached Crack and exclaimed, "Sir! Resistance on the mainland is finally subsiding, but we're facing increased pushback from factions within the Party."\nCrack's eyes narrowed. "It was seditious factions that destroyed the previous General Secretary, I won't let them destroy me. See to it that these traitors, especially any remaining Harmonists, are dealt with severely."\n\nThe officer saluted and left just as a bureaucrat approached Crack's desk. "Sir, I have a proposal for you. There are very few communist states that approve of our... unique system. If we were to make a clean break with socialist internationalism, we might be able to normalize relations with the many supremacist states of the world."\n\nCrack smiled. "Sounds good to me. I was never much of an internationalist."\n"I have the announcement right here, it just needs your signature."\n\nCrack opened his desk to grab a pen, but as he looked inside he noticed something stuck in the back of the drawer. It was a photo of him and Posada, smiling with their fins around each other. He paused to consider what he was doing. Posada had always tried to show him the shortcomings of nationalism. Maybe it was time he started listening."

Gallus began, looking around the office, still strewn with Posada's old papers, "What happened? You always talked about Hippogriffia as this beautiful place, but now..."\n"Oh we're just all sad about our leader being dead!"\n"But, what about Novo? And Skystar? Even on Griffonia we got word of what was happening, the way 'Revolutionary North Zebrica' turned against Harmony, conquered its neighbours, the horrible things you all did in Chiropterra..."\n\n"I... I don't know," Silverstream said, her voice breaking, "I don't know what happened. Skystar tried to explain it to me, said that the poor of Hippogriffia saw our family as responsible for keeping them poor, talked about her mom's mistakes... She asked me to form a Harmonist wing in the communist party, and I did, and I tried to stop the violence, but I didn't do enough and now everything is ruined and I didn't do enough and Skystar's gotten really quiet ever since Posada killed herself and I don't know what I'm supposed to do!"\n\nGallus hugged her as Silverstream sobbed.\n"I was never supposed to be in charge! I just put my name forward because I couldn't think of anything else to do. And now, I don't know anything..."\n\n"You know more about friendship than anygriff. They chose you because they knew they needed Harmony to come back. Not restoring the monarchy or anything, but just... apologizing. Making amends, stopping all the anger.

No religious iconography, no ostentation, just a simple headstone of black basalt engraved with an atom symbol and a name: Posada, General Secretary of Revolutionary North Zebrica, 980-[GetYear].\n\nThere was no body underneath it; not even ash remained of Crack's old friend. He swam up to it, noticing the little seashell which had been left. Furrowing his brow, he made a guttural noise and knocked it off, watching it spin off a short way before floating down and settling on the sand.\n\nSkystar had been here. The damned princess had wanted to make a show of caring about Posada, when it was her moralizing, her pleas, her abusing Posada's conscience which led to her suicide. It was despicable, and Crack choked for a moment on the water: he was almost too angry to breathe.\n\nFinally, after remembering how to use his gills, Crack looked down at the headstone. "I'm sorry, Posada," he said. "I should have helped you. I should have seen what was happening to you. You and I, we both knew what had to be done. Even though we were divided at first, we saw while everygriff else was blind. But you were too kind for it. I should have helped."\n\nCrack closed his eyes. Posada had always been an atheist, but he was sure Tiamat had welcomed her after all she had done for the seaponies.\n"Worry not, my friend. You swept away the degenerate monarchy. You crushed our enemies, made the world tremble at us. And I will see that legacy upheld. Aris shall not fall, Posada. And I will punish those... those Harmonist reactionaries, even the ones who call themselves communists, who cursed you for doing what had to be done. They hounded you to your death, but I won't let them do the same for me. I will make them pay.""

Your achievements in Hippogriffia are admirable, as is the way you have addressed the Zumidian zebras as your comrades, rather than your subjects. However, I cannot allow you to continue in your current path, and I hope by the time you have read this letter you will see why.\n\nYou have always spoken against imperialism, but while your presses spill rivers of ink rightly condemning it, your armies prepare to spill rivers of blood to bend the nations of North Zebrica to your will. Do you not see the contradiction? I have praised your state and its achievements, but the culture, the history, and thus the destiny of Hippogriffia is not that of Zarantia, Warzena, Chiropterra, or indeed of Zumidia or Zonicia. And so as one idealist to another, I would like to offer you an alternative vision.\n\nLet us work together, as a commonwealth of independent nations, supporting each other in developing their own unique forms of harmonious life. I ask that we combine our resources to rebuild the nations of this region devastated by this era of war, and then to walk with them in friendship rather than ruling over them in a vast super-state.\n\nI understand that our visions are very different, and that they may seem totally incompatible even, but I trust you will see the wisdom in these words and abandon your current ambitions in favour of something which trusts the creatures of other nations to determine their own destinies.\n\nSincerely,\n-Zeshunamash Zeirutid."\n\nPosada set down the letter, her claws shaking slightly after the third re-read.

 arisfirst.2.desc:0 "The supporters of the controversial Aris First movement gathered together for a rally in Starfield. Waving flags or photographs of Queen Novo, the Aris First supporters cheered and chanted their patriotism in a rowdy display. When their leader Raft Wood got up on the stage, the cheers grew even louder, quickly turning to boos as he told of the latest insults coming from the zebras.\n\n"Cowards, they call us!" he exclaimed to the crowd, "I have it right here, from the mouth of a political chief in Colthage: 'the Hippogriffs boast of their victory over the Storm King, as though fighting a single lucky battle after years of hiding can compare to the grueling campaigns we zebras fought against him all across the continent.' We save them, and this is how they treat us. And then they come to the Zumidian refugee zone and exploit our generosity. No more I say! Queen Novo was right to retreat to Seaquestria, she was right to emerge when she did, and we shall suffer no further slander to our people or our queen!"\n\nThe crowd's cheers were joined by the sound of propellers, as Crack Lightning made a flyover in the Spirit of Starfield, the custom fighter plane he had shot down one of the Storm King's mighty airships with. Over the two hours of the rally, the crowd swelled from some five hundred to nearly a thousand, with hundreds of passers-by and local residents getting swept up in the patriotic jubilation and signing up for the Aris First movement."

Sew Stopper blamed Aquileian imports for destroying his business. While many have condemned the attack as evidence of Aris First's "xenophobic thuggery," others have expressed sympathy for Sew Stopper's situation, even if they don't approve of his actions."

 arisfirst.4.t:0 "The Clothing Partition"
 arisfirst.4.desc:0 "The "Clothing Debate" has come to a head, with Aris First and their opponents both demanding that Queen Novo take a solid position on the issue of foreign clothing in Hippogriffia. Raft Wood has presented a petition with thousands of signatures demanding that government workers only be allowed to wear clothing made in Hippogriffia, claiming that the influx of foreign clothing "Dilutes our identity and damages our economy, leading to unrest and poverty."\nThe petitioners claim that having government employees wear foreign clothing at work sends a particularly bad message, because as servants of the crown they are also representatives of Hippogriffia. It spreads the idea that foreign nations produce better cultural products than our own, which damages national unity.\n\nHardliners within Aris First have demanded the government go even further, pointing to the lax labour laws and lower quality control standards in Griffonia and arguing that "greedy griffons" would still find ways to undercut and eventually destroy the Aris clothing industry even with Raft Wood's proposed ban.\n\nMore liberal voices have denounced the whole issue as "a silly affair" and have argued that no Harmonist government should pass laws mandating what its citizens wear, as doing so is an unacceptable breach of personal liberty. They've also argued that competition breeds innovation, and that the exchange of fashion between Hippogriffia and other nations has caused new and exciting fashion trends to develop, which would be stifled by the government issuing bans. Notably, Princess Skystar and Silverstream have come out against the proposed bans, saying that Hippogriffia should be friendly towards other nations, with Silverstream pointing to the griffon and pony friends she made in Equestria as reasons why Hippogriffs don't need to be afraid of other creatures."

It is no secret that Crack Lightning and I have disagreements, but only now am I realizing the full extent of our differences. Aris First has always stood for isolationism, for putting our own interests ahead of foreign ones, but Crack Lightning and his hardliners, particularly his ridiculous 'Phalanx,' want us to destroy our own traditions in the name of, and I cannot believe I am saying this..."\n\nRaft Wood took a pause, swimming about anxiously and checking for the fifth time if the room was bugged. He was the one who was supposed to know if someone was being watched, but with his allies turning against him he couldn't be too careful.\n\n"The vile Wingbardian ideology of fascism," he concluded. "Many of you have worked with the AHAC, and know that fascism is against our way of life. Rather than withdrawing us from Zebrica, Crack Lightning would see us become even more entangled in it. Worse yet, fascism requires one supreme leader, which means he undoubtedly plans to sideline and eliminate both Queen Novo and, well, me."\n\nRaft Wood let his statement sink in, reading the room for a moment. The signs had always been there, but it felt odd to say out loud that the charismatic hippogriff which had carried his movement to power now sought to remove Raft Wood from the picture.\n\n"The hardliners control the military, the Phalanx, and a significant portion of Aris First. Since we are only now becoming aware of the threat, we have to assume they are several steps ahead of us. We have the AHAC, the intelligence agencies, and the police, plus the fact that very few hippogriffs want to live in a fascist state. We will have to act quickly, yet subtly. Prevent him from raising the jingoistic fervour of the masses to a high enough pitch that they demand we go to war, watch the military for the signs of a coup d'etat, and remove his influence from Aris First. While we're doing that, I will arrange secret AHAC meetings to build a case to arrest him. If we act too brashly, his supporters will hang us in the streets. Too timidly, and he'll have us all shot. I trust you all to know what to do when the time comes.""

If pegasi or bats want to wear hippogriff clothing, they should get it from hippogriffs, or better yet try designing something half as good themselves."\nWhen asked what the harm was, he replied: "The harm is that these knock-offs are the first experience these creatures have with our culture, and having Polomare market these takes jobs away from our hard-working textile workers."\nMore liberal voices have reacted with astonished confusion, with Cross Stitch defending her and Polomare's work as "An attempt to blend the fashion taste of New Mareland ponies with the stylistic trends of Mt.

They admire Crack Lightning, calling him "The Ace" and idolizing his patriotism, prowess, and exploits.\n\nLightning has denounced the Inquirer as slanderous, saying that the Phalanx is just a veteran's organization mainly concerned with physical fitness, sharing war stories, and a life of adventure, and are not even affiliated with Aris First.\nHe said that the Inquirer, which had consistently made AF out as villains, had sunk to a new low by accusing a veteran's organization of being an extremist militia.\n\nThe high command and the AHAC have been pressured to take an official position on the Phalanx."

Well we've had enough, and we're not gonna leave until something is done about this!"\n\nWhile the police managed to disperse the protestors after the third day, numerous newspaper editorials have come out supporting them, and with Lucky Break and other industry leaders refusing to answer the protestors' demands, they have turned to the government in hopes of getting a ban on the import of foreign cars."

Aris First leader Raft Wood, who was once high in Novo's court, has appealed this rejection directly to the Queen, an act unheard of until now, requesting that she overturn the mayor's decision and allow their peaceful gathering to go ahead. Wood said in a heartfelt letter that Aris First has always stood in support of the monarch, and merely wishes to make their message known in a location so in tune with the traditions of the nation they hold dear. As well as assuring her that he and Crack Lightning had already put plans in place to ensure the rally did not ruin the scenery. Finally, he also argued that the mayor's decision was motivated by anti-Aris First bias and pre-existing political agendas against him, and that any other Arisian would allow him to hold the rally.\n\nWhile there is nothing truly illegal about the attempted rally, the concerns of the Mayor are valid, and allowing this petition to be received by the Queen could be a show of official support from the monarch."

 arisfirst.9.desc:0 "Madness today on the streets of Mount Aris as the Aris First rally set to be held there has become a point of martyrdom for one of its leaders, Crack Lightning. Speaking to a small town outside of Mount Aris, as well as broadcasted over the radio, he has railed against the government's choice to prevent his rally from taking place. Stating; "This government claims to wish to bring principles of freedom to our nation, yet they have somehow forgotten the freedom of speech! The Hippogriffs of Mount Aris wish to hear our truth, and somehow they allow one corrupt mayor to prevent us from speaking?"\n\nLightning's remarks were echoed by other Aris First speakers around the country, but the results seem to be lacking. The government's refusal to allow the rally to go ahead seems to have taken some steam out of the movement, especially since the Queen herself made no comment on the issue.\n\nLightning was, however, quick to separate the Queen from her government, saying "Oh Queen Novo! How they have failed and deceived you! One day you shall see that we only fight for your good, and you shall rid yourself of those disgusting foreign lackeys who hold you hostage!" Queen Novo declined to comment on this as well."

They were singing and chanting their love for their country. Steel Feather found himself singing along to "Gods Save the Queen" with a voice he never knew he had, as if it was the first time singing it.\n\nWhen Crack Lighting appeared on stage, the wind gusted through Harmonising Heights, and the music of The Mountain joined Steel Feather as he joined the crowd and the crowd joined Crack Lightning, singing out the love of their nation.\n\nAll the papers had lied, they had lied! Aris First were not thugs, they were Aris! Steel Feather joined in the chants of "One Mountain, One People, One Will!" which the crowd broke into after the national anthem, raising their claws to Crack Lightning: the patriot, the war hero, The Ace.\n\nSteel Feather didn't even remember what The Ace had said afterwards, or what his stolid compatriot Raft Wood had said, but he remembered the pure joy of that night for the rest of his life. Of course, when they passed around the enrollment sheets for Aris First, he signed up and pledged a modest donation.

Raft Wood slowly lifted his head, "My Queen. We seek only the preservation of the nation, the prosperity of its people-" Crack Lightning suddenly cut him off, "-and the removal of all of your enemies, your Highness."\n\nNovo looked down from her throne onto the two hippogriffs. She was the one in power here. She was the one who had the choice of whether to allow these two to take control. They should be at every disadvantage; Raft Wood didn't even enjoy his hippogriff form! And yet, she felt fear. Fear of what was to come, around every corner, dark futures lurked. But was what stood before her any brighter? She had to trust her creatures, her hippogriffs and her seaponies. They said they wanted these two in control. She had to do it. She had to. She just had to.\n\nRaft Wood, seeing the distress of his Queen, spoke up again, "Your Highness, I understand this must be stressful for you. It has been for all of us. The enemies of Hippogriffia still gather on the horizon, and we have made you aware of it. We keep no secrets from you and never shall. The nation must be defended." Crack Lightning rose from the ground, keeping his head low, he handed Novo a piece of paper, "Here are the requested appointments."\n\nLooking them over, Novo breathed, nodded slowly, and tapped a bell on her desk. A hippogriff entered, and she addressed her, "Take the message to Seaquestria. I have chosen to appoint these two to government." Turning back to the hippogriffs in front of her, she declared, "Go then, announce to the people. I must take a personal moment." before hurrying off.\n\nBefore Raft could even rise, Crack Lightning had flown to one of the balconies of the royal palace, and looked down at the crowd that had assembled outside, then he shouted to the high heavens his one message..."

While they agreed on many things, now that it was time to get down to the business of governing Raft Wood couldn't help but feel like Crack Lightning had forgotten what Aris First was about.\n\nOn the Zumidian problem, Raft Wood had wanted to simply abandon them, but Crack Lightning had insisted on exploiting them. Raft Wood wanted to continue the AHAC's policies of acting primarily as protection against actual extremists, while Lightning wanted to use it to perscute alleged "objective enemies" and enforce some vague but extremely-high standard of loyalty which he had yet to properly explain. When Raft had expressed concern about the growing militancy of Crack's Phalanx, Crack had dismissed it out of claw. While they both wanted to promote harmony among classes, Lightning's proposal on how to do so required major economic restructuring in what he called a "Solidarist economic revolution," massively overturning Aris' economic system for the sake of what he called a national reforging. Most worryingly, Crack Lightning was speaking of foreign powers as if a final war with them was inevitable, and arguing Hippogriffia should strike first.\n\nAfter Crack left, Raft closed his eyes, letting his colleague's proposals stew in his mind. Everything was somehow off. He'd felt it ever since the Phalanx formed, ever since Aris First had adopted the "One Mountain, One People, One Will" slogan. One Will.\n\nRaft's eyes shot open, and he turned to his secretary."

Seeing this, Lightning huffed and rolled his eyes at Wood. \n\n"Well...for example your order, Mr Wood, among other items, requests artillery pieces for coastal defence and air defence. While your order, Mr Lightning, asks for more...aggressive products, such as tanks, bombers and ships to support naval landings." \n"What is your point, Mr Moonfeather?" Crack Lightning asked. \n"My point is that you would owe me a lot of money if I had to fulfil both your requests. I hope you are able to pay?" The businessgriff elaborated, clasping his claws in front of himself. \n\n"Of course, we-" \n"Perhaps-" \nThe two duumvirs glanced at each other after interrupting themselves. \nLightning spoke again: "What we mean to say is that we are willing to pay any price to ensure Hippogriffia will defeat its future enemies." \n"Yes, anything to deter would-be aggressors." Raft Wood finished, ignoring the look he got from Lightning for his word choice. \n\nMoonfeather had been watching these verbal spars between these two Arisians with growing intrigue. They disagreed when it came to their defence budget. He would have been concerned about Hippogriffia's security, but all he saw was opportunity. He would stir this rivalry by encouraging them to buy the materials they each sought for their different strategies. Regardless of who would win in this little feud the profits would go to him. \n\nHe hid his growing smile by interrupting the staring contest taking place between Lightning and Wood.

The attempts to limit the patriotic activities of the Phalanx, whose soldiers only wanted to stop foreigners from destroying Hippogriffia. Which foreign power did Raft Wood conspire with?

Her righteous rage when she'd seen Silverstream on the list had reminded Raft Wood why he'd always been loyal to her.\n\nStill, Raft Wood was uneasy. And it wasn't just the war. Crack Lightning had been the ideological thought leader between the two; Raft Wood had just followed his gut instincts and vague feelings that Hippogriffia needed to be protected against foreign influence. Raft's patriotism had blinded him until the last moment; what was he to do now that he could see? How deep had the fascist rot taken root in his movement? Had his own thoughts been twisted away from Harmony by Lightning's venom?\n\nHe wouldn't embrace the progressives wholesale; the very thought of making Hippogriffia into a second-rate Equestria revolted him, to say nothing of the republicans and the socialists and all those other foreign ideologies. But he would speak to Silverstream, and gather what was left of Aris First for a party conference.

That was... odd? She didn't receive any civilian mail.\n\nHeading downstairs, she saw a letter had been passed through the slit in her door. Throwing the door open, there was no sign of the mailpony anywhere. No car he could have come in and no trace of where he had gone.\n\nThe letter looked incredibly mundane.

Of course they'd want revenge for what the LMRD had done to their fellow labourers, even if the exact details were kept secret from them. Of course they'd want revenge for years of hard labour, forced conversions, for being snatched away from their families and made into slaves. Those who hadn't participated in the riots had been ill-equipped to contain them, having no real training, and had quickly abandoned their posts or died. A few had even returned to Zarantia or Warzena, taking their weapons with them and becoming small-time arms dealers or hired guns.\n\nAnd then there were the true Lunarist converts, who had taken their Hippogriff guns and Hippogriff ammunition and went straight to the hills to join the insurgents. When the insurgents heard of the riots in Howling Hills, they'd gotten there before Hippogriff security forces and killed most of the armed labourers, earning the appreciation of the civilian population and taking the Hippogriff guns with them.\n\nOverall, a complete disaster, although there was a silver lining: in the bloodbath, one of the bodies identified belonged to none other than Lady Commander Lightning Charm, one of the lynchpins of the Chiropterran resistance. If Violet and her agents could act fast, they might just be able to salvage the situation while the resistance was leaderless. But that required her utmost attention, and no meddling from Raft Wood."

With staggering coordination, insurgents struck at the garrison's barracks, mess halls, checkpoints and armouries all across Chiropterra. Weapons were stolen, vehicles sabotaged, and hundreds of hippogriffs killed or taken hostage.\n\nLocal informants considered reliable had led units into ambushes; civilian populations thought pacified had turned out to be hiding more insurgents. The AHAC agents Violet had sent to Chiropterra had all been found dead, killed with bombs, knives, or poison. The records Violet had been keeping in her safehouse were taken: if there was anything the resistance didn't know before, they knew it now.\n\nIn a single day, the Chiropterrans had killed all hope that the occupation could succeed: the resistance had gotten bolder after Lightning Charm's death, rather than fragmenting. Raft Wood needed no persuasion. The occupation was over. Over four days of tense negotiations, Raft Wood and a negotiator speaking for Stirling Silver worked out a peace treaty.\n\nHippogriffia would fully withdraw its forces from Chiropterra, and pledge to respect the sovereignty of the Chiropterran nation. In exchange, Stirling Silver would release his hostages, one unit at a time to preserve leverage, and allow the remaining garrison to be extracted from Chiropterra without further harrassment from the insurgents.\n\nFinally, in a move which made Raft Wood nearly lose his composure, the negotiator promised that Stirling would prevent Ocean Spray's Crescent Moon Society from launching a chemical attack on Hippogriffia itself, which had been planned for next month. After signing the treaty, Raft Wood couldn't shake the feeling that he had condemned the next generation of Hippogriffs to another Chiropterran war, perhaps more terrible than the last."

They approached Firstport and tried to clear the roadblock you had marked as the objective."\nThe Lieutenant paused, "There was a machine gun." Colonel Thorn was speechless, but the Lieutenant kept hitting, "They tried to withdraw, but there were snipers on the hills. No bodies were recovered... Colonel, how should I report the operation to High Command?"\n\nThorn gestured for the officer to leave. Sitting down at the table, he looked upon his plan. So meticulous, relying on the idea that they were the victorious power, that they were here to clean up, not win another war. He watched as all the lines made sense, how he failed them so terribly, how he was vain and foolish to think he could expect everything to just work out. \n\nHe couldn't let himself fail them again, so he drew his gun, and added one more casualty to the list."

 arisfirst.70.d:0 "Crack Lightning swirled the whiskey around in his glass, looking around the table at the officers before him.\n\n"Chiropterra," he mused, "Chiropterra, Chiropterra. Such a beautiful state. Every single creature, united in purpose, working towards the greater good. It is a pity, that to fulfil our destiny we had to stifle theirs, but such is the way of the world."\n\n"Sir?" asked Colonel Razorbeak as Crack Lightning paused his speech with a drawn-out sip of his whiskey,\n"The task at claw?"\n\n"Yes, yes, of course. Razorbeak, you and Solid Stone wanted to fill the vacancy for military governor of Chiropterra. I assume you both know the rather gruesome nature of your predecessor's departure, and his predecessor before him. So, out with it. Tell me your plans for the occupation."\n\n"Well," began Razorbeak, "I will start by reducing work quotas. In many districts, the work quotas could drop by as much as fifty percent. I'll ensure that each district is run according to the highest standards: abolish child labour, provide medical care, increase food rations. Drop the death rate; as long as they think they're dead anyways they'll do anything to avenge themselves. Then the matter of reprisals. When terrorist attacks happened, my predecessor would order indiscriminate reprisals, no sense of proportionality. I will set clear rules: when they kill one of ours, we kill one of theirs, preferably chosen from those most likely to have aided the insurgents. Clear rules, clear consequences; justice, not malevolence. I will make sure every community knows that it is the resistance endangering their lives, not us."\n\nSolid Stone scoffed, launching into his proposal without waiting for Lightning's go-ahead.\n"The Chiropterrans will respond to her lenience with greater aggression. My proposal is far simpler. We will confiscate their agricultural machinery and engineer a famine. We will make food relief conditional on compliance. Hunger will succeed where truncheons have failed.""

 hippogriff_abyss.1.t:0 "The Mareiana Report"
 hippogriff_abyss.1.d:0 "A minor incident has arisen lately in the AHAC, involving the recent patrolling of the Mareiana Trench outside of Seaquestria. While the small detachment sent to the depths reported everything as normal initially, we soon lost contact with them hours later, and they did not return upon the scheduled time. It was only a day later, right as a search party was ready to look for them that they appeared from the trench, looking a little worse for wear but otherwise unharmed. Upon being questioned for their extended absence and lack of contact, they repeatedly insisted that they remembered nothing during their time down in the Mareiana Trench.\n\nA minor report on the incident has been filed, and the guards are being sent for further questioning, but other than that the AHAC has seen no need to take further action. Officials are insisting that there is nothing to worry about, and that the seaponies most likely suffered from short-term memory loss due to an accident or something along those lines."
 hippogriff_abyss.1.a:0 "Still, we should hold off on more expeditions for the time being."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.2.t:0 "The Underwater Societies"
 hippogriff_abyss.2.d:0 "More troubling news is coming out of Seaquestria as of late, this time involving issues of a more serious nature. Multiple officials stationed around the underwater nation have reported the formation of what seem to be secret societies all over Seaquestria, each being eerily similar to each other. And yet, despite our best efforts we have been unable to discern their intention, or even what kind of threat they may pose to both seaponies and hippogriffs. What we do know is that they are rapidly growing in number, and while currently constrained beneath the waves some on Mount Aris are afraid that it may spread to the mainland.\n\nEven more worrying is that evidence points to the seaponies sent to the Mareiana Trench as responsible for starting the societies, and we have been unable to find them since only a few short weeks after their return. Fearful whispers speak of a plot growing against Hippogriffia itself, but for now they remained consigned to just that; rumors. All we can do at the moment is wait and see what these societies will do."
 hippogriff_abyss.2.a:0 "Let us hope that the situation does not escalate..."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.3.t:0 "Breakdown of Order"
 hippogriff_abyss.3.d:0 "Just as we feared, the situation has escalated in Seaquestria. Only a few days ago, violence broke out all across the underwater realm, plunging large parts of it into chaos. Small feuds that normally would be resolved with simple words, like running into one another and different tastes in music have all incited physical assaults, seapony fighting seapony until broken up by others. The societies were our initial suspects, but it seems that the phenomenon has affected even them as some in their ranks were sighted engaging in blows. The rest continue to meet in secluded places, unhindered by the crisis.\n\nNo matter the cause, the situation is untenable and something must now be done. A possible solution would be to send in more hippogriff soldiers underwater to enforce peace until the seaponies regain their wits. While it would prove immensely unpopular with some and may take a while, we would at least minimize the damage and spread of the violent outbreak.\n\nAnother option proposed by the cabinet is to seek help from Equestria and the Elements of Harmony. Foul magic seems to be at play here, and the ponies have aided us before in our time of need. With their help, whatever is causing this will surely be caught and order restored quickly, as long as the Equestrians actually agree to help.\n\nOf course, we could also always just wait out the chaos and hope that the seaponies regain their sanity on their own."
 hippogriff_abyss.3.a:0 "We can deal with this ourselves."
 hippogriff_abyss.3.b:0 "The Elements saved us once; we must ask for their aid again."
 hippogriff_abyss.3.c:0 "This chaos is simply temporary, we just have to wait it out."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.4.t:0 "Seaquestrian Order Restored"
 hippogriff_abyss.4.d:0 "After many painstaking months of work by our forces, Seaquestria has finally recovered from its brief period of chaos and the seaponies have returned to their normal friendly state. The initial weeks were the hardest, as at first those affected were incredibly difficult to subdue, constantly struggling and fighting if a single other seapony was nearby. Only isolated did they become docile. This tactic, although slow was used throughout all of Seaquestria, ensuring peace bit by bit. Fortunately, whatever seemed to be possessing them weakened the further we progressed.\n\nThe hidden societies did cause some trouble initially as well, attempting to stop our forces from interferring in the violence. They too were subdued, and after order was completely restored they seem to have regained their senses as well. All of them have disbanded, though just as before when questioned they stated that they had no memory of the meetings or of what was discussed.\n\nWhat caused this terrible incident we may never know, but at least it is over. The Mareiana Trench has also been put on an indefinite ban of travel for the time being."
 hippogriff_abyss.4.a:0 "At least we got that finally sorted."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.5.t:0 "A Plea from Hippogriffia"
 hippogriff_abyss.5.d:0 "Trouble seems to be stirring in Zebrica, for a recent message has arrived from our old friends in Hippogriffia. Seeming to be in a rush, the hippogriff hurriedly explained that Seaquestria has fallen into chaos, and that the aid of the Elements of Harmony were needed. Believing that dark magic was behind it, they hope that as friends the Element Bearers will agree to travel back to Mount Aris temporarily and restore order to the aquatic realm.\n\nThere is no doubt that if asked, Princess Twilight and her friends will agree to help the hippogriffs once more. The question is whether we can afford to send them at the moment. The world is only growing more turbulent, and it is quite possible that we need the Elements here and now. However, denying expected help would sour relations with our old friends, and could result in further chaos in Hippogriffia."
 hippogriff_abyss.5.a:0 "Of course we will help, assemble the Elements!"
 hippogriff_abyss.5.b:0 "Sorry, but we need them here and now."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.6.t:0 "A Quick Wrap-up"
 hippogriff_abyss.6.d:0 ""So the freed cultists have no memory of what started it? No information? Nothing?"\n"I'm afraid so, Queen Novo," replied Twilight Sparkle, "Only fragments of dreams. Once we used the Elements to stop the music, there was nothing left of whatever strange instruments the cultists were playing, and none of them even remembered what they were doing in the last month, or how they got there. I wish we had more to go off of, but we just don't have enough data."\n"It's a terrible shame we couldn't stay here longer," commented Rarity, "I do so love my seapony form, and by the sound of it Skystar and Pinkie have just gotten started on their reunion party."\n"You can feel free to stay a little longer. I'm just glad it's over without too many of us getting hurt. I'm honestly not sure what we would have done without you."\n"Oh it's nothing, really! You're our friends, and besides it was your idea to use a deafening spell before sending us in. Without that, we'd have been helpless against it."\n\nNovo sighed. "I do hate not knowing what almost destroyed my kingdom. But oh well, all's well that ends well. I'll have my magical researchers look over all the data we can find, and share it with you if anything comes up. In the meantime, let's join Pinkie and Skystar out there. It looks like half of Seaquestria's getting in on their party, so let's not miss it.""
 hippogriff_abyss.6.a:0 "We may not know what caused it, but at least it's behind us now."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.7.t:0 "The Equestrian Betrayal"
 hippogriff_abyss.7.d:0 "Terrible news! The Equestrians have, against our every hope and wish, decided not to send the Elements to aid us in our troubles in Seaquestria! We have not been made aware of the reasoning, but it seems highly unlikely that Princess Twilight herself decided not to aid us. More likely the Equestrian government simply ignored our calls for help for their own gain. This is a severe betrayal that we will not be forgetting anytime soon, but for now we have much more pressing matters to deal with.\n\nWith the Elements no longer an option, we are forced back to our original two ideas; either enforcing law and order in Seaquestria or doing nothing. The time spent wasted waiting on the Equestrian response has only worsened the situation, and no matter what we choose there will be repercussions across the nation. Word has already spread about the Equestrian debacle, and there are some calling us fools for ever relying on a foreign power."
 hippogriff_abyss.7.a:0 "Fine, we don't need their help to solve our problems."
 hippogriff_abyss.7.b:0 "Without the Elements we can do nothing..."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.8.t:0 "Peaceful Spread in [HIP_cult_gathering_state.GetName]"
 hippogriff_abyss.8.d:0 "The spread of our cult in [HIP_cult_gathering_state.GetName] was an absolute success, with members now spread all throughout the region. Conflict with non-members was at a minimum, and any confrontation with officials out of fear of our motives was quickly defused without escalation. The entire state is now securely under our influence, and our numbers have been bolstered by the new converts from the population."
 hippogriff_abyss.8.a:0 "The push towards control of Hippogriffia continues."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.9.t:0 "Minor Confrontation in [HIP_cult_gathering_state.GetName]"
 hippogriff_abyss.9.d:0 "Despite some minor conflicts and violence, the spread of our cult in [HIP_cult_gathering_state.GetName] was a success. While non-members did start minor fights with our own agents, they were relatively localized and contained. Some may still be afraid of our intentions and future actions, but for now the state is secure and our numbers grown."
 hippogriff_abyss.9.a:0 "Small roadbumps on the path towards victory."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.10.t:0 "Violent Outbreak in [HIP_cult_gathering_state.GetName]"
 hippogriff_abyss.10.d:0 "Unfortunately, our recent efforts to spread the cult in [HIP_cult_gathering_state.GetName] have been met with multiple outbreaks of fighting and violence. While our members were able to hold off the angry and terrified hippogriffs who had not yet joined us, the situation deteriorated to the point where the police had to intervene. The entire state is now on high alert, and though we have still expanded our numbers and have undercover control of the region, word has spread as the country drifts further towards instability and perhaps even open war against us."
 hippogriff_abyss.10.a:0 "Quite unfortunate, but our goal must stop for none."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.11.t:0 "Song of the Deep"
 hippogriff_abyss.11.d:0 "The capital had been taken hours ago. Fighting had been fierce and bloody, for while the cultists vastly outnumbered those still remaining, they did not have the weaponry or the skill that the royal guard of the palace did. But still, eventually numbers won out as our masses pushed forward endlessly, taking Mount Aris hall by hall, room by room. Each of our loyalists fought to their last breath, for our cause was great, greater than any other on Hippogriffia.\n\nThe throne room itself was the last holdout of resistance, but even that was overrun when the masses made a concentrated push at once. Queen Novo was captured relatively unharmed and is currently behind held captive, but unfortunately Princess Skystar is nowhere to be found. We believe she escaped long before our assault began, though where we are unsure of yet.\n\nBut that does not matter now. Nothing does, except what is to come. We have waited, waited for far too long for this moment. The doors open, and our masters float towards the throne we killed and died for, their tails and fins swishing in the open air. We all bow our heads to the floor. The teal one looks excited and giddy, while the pink one simply looks annoyed at the former. The yellow one just smirks, and by compulsion we rise once more, staring blankly as their three red gems inlaid in their chests glow.\n\nOur task is complete. Now, it is time for the whole world to hear their song as well."
 hippogriff_abyss.11.a:0 "Let the new age begin."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.12.t:0 "The Hippogriff Civil War"
 hippogriff_abyss.12.d:0 "With tensions continuously rising between cultist and loyalist, it was only a matter of time until it blew into the open. Unfortunately, that moment of time is now, as the government has declared us a danger to the Kingdom and started mass arrests. Now, we have no choice but to fight back, and with force. As the army is sent in, we have armed ourselves to prepare for the civil war.\n\nThe areas that we have already secured have already formed into makeshift divisions, but sources say that those loyal to Queen Novo have done the same. We can only hope now that our efforts beforehoof were enough to prevail now."
 hippogriff_abyss.12.a:0 "So it has come to this."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.13.t:0 "Song of the Deep"
 hippogriff_abyss.13.d:0 "What a waste. So many lives needlessly lost in a pointless war. So many voices made silent. This little conflict was nothing more than an annoyance, and yet it was necessary all the same. These mortals sought to undo our plan, one over a thousand years in the making, and had to be eliminated.\n\nOur servants did well, despite their foolish blunder in igniting open war. They were a useful tool, though still only a means to an end. Once the remaining hippogriffs surrendered, there was no more need of such zealotry, and so we dispelled our magic leaving them docile, yet no longer single-minded. They will fall in line with the rest of the mortals, serving a new purpose. Our purpose.\n\nWe have waited far too long for this. What has happened now is only a glimpse of what is to come, of what is our right. This world has become far too complacent, dividing themselves on trivial things such as ideologies or politics. We will offer them a new solution, a new chance to be part of something greater, serving us. Soon they'll find they don't have a choice.\n\nOur time is now, and their time is running out. Listen closely to our music...\n\n...For the show is about to start."
 hippogriff_abyss.13.a:0 "Let the new age begin."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.14.t:0 "The New World"
 hippogriff_abyss.14.d:0 "Change. It was quite obvious to Aria that the world was full of it. Even keeping in mind the fact that she was on an entire new continent now, barely anything was recognizable. What was once mere villages were now massive cities, what once took weeks to create now took hours, and magic... Adagio would never admit it, but Aria could see the writing on the wall. Their magic was no longer undefeatable, and it wasn't just that old fool Starswirl that proved that over a millennia ago. The weapons that creatures now possessed were dangerous, and they needed to be treated carefully.\n\n"There you are, Aria." The purple siren secretly rolled her eyes as the "leader" of the trio swam over. "Where have you been? Don't tell me you've been in Seaquestria with Sonata."\n\n"Of course not, Adagio. I'm getting this place ready for war."\n\nAdagio looked like she had seen Aria sprout a second head. "Excuse me? What are you talking about?"\n\nTurning, the purple siren kept her level, downright-bored disposition as she spoke. "We need an army, Adagio. We can't just go around and sing to the entire world. We're just going to get banished again, or worse. This world has new rules, new weapons, and we need them if we're going to go after our 'birthright' or whatever."\n\nAdagio sputtered for a bit before recovering. "Fine, just be ready to play your part when the time comes. I need to go find Sonata again and make sure she isn't blowing something up.""
 hippogriff_abyss.14.a:0 "It's time for us to change our tactics."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.15.t:0 "Destiny"
 hippogriff_abyss.15.d:0 "It was a disgrace. Truly, there was no better word to describe it. Over a thousand years, and the world had already all but forgotten about them. About her. They thought themselves more advanced just from their new toys, but Adagio could see through it all. Magic still ruled, magic always ruled, and she was the one who was supposed to rule with it.\n\nBut that was not what had happened. Her destiny, her birthright had been taken by fools, ponies who thought themselves above the natural order. Destiny, though, is only delayed, never stopped. They could not take away her voice, the gift of a true siren.\n\nThe time wasn't ready yet. There was still much to be done, more power to gain, more subjects to enthrall. Soon, however, she would make her triumphant return to Equestria. Her plans would come to fruition, with just a bit of patience.\n\nAnd Adagio was very good at that."
 hippogriff_abyss.15.a:0 "We bide our time until the opportunity arises."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.16.t:0 "Another Partner?"
 hippogriff_abyss.16.d:0 ""We need another member in our group."\n\nBoth Aria and Sonata looked up in surprise. "A fourth? You know we've never found another siren in all our lives, Adagio. What do you mean, 'another member'?" Aria asked, a bit of curiosity seeping into her normally flat tone.\n\nAdagio just rolled her eyes. "I wasn't talking about another siren. Doing everything ourselves is just wasting our time, and our voices. We need someone to do the dirty work for us, manage affairs while we look at the bigger picture."\n\nSonata perked up a bit before her expression quickly deflated. "But like, everyone here hates us! Who would even want to help without being under our spell?"\n\n"Sonata has a point," Aria agreed. "For once."\n\n"Yeah- hey!"\n\nAs the two devolved into yet another argument, Adagio looked out the window from the palace. The city of Mount Aris spread before her, the clueless hippogriffs walking and arguing in the streets. And further away, the factories continued to work, along with the housing where the wealthy elite still lived...\n\nAdagio smirked. Perhaps the world wasn't so different as it once was after all."
 hippogriff_abyss.16.a:0 ""I have an idea in mind...""
 
 hippogriff_abyss.17.t:0 "The Collaborator"
 hippogriff_abyss.17.d:0 "Plumage Moonfeather had faced many things in his life. Rival businessgriffs, workers, profit margins, and even the former Hippogriffian government. He knew how to play the game and how to play it well, and that was how he had thrived and become one of the richest birds on Aris.\n\nAnd yet, nothing could have possibly prepared him for the situation he now found himself in.\n\n"You what me to do what now?" he asked, the slightly tinge of fear creeping in as the three sirens stared him down. He fought the urge to take a step back; showing weakness was never a good thing.\n\n"It's quite simple," the siren in yellow said. "We want a hippogriff who can run parts of this island in our stead while we focus on other things. And we believe that you can be that hippogriff."\n\nThe gears in Moonfeather's mind began turning. And then he realized it. This wasn't a meeting for threats or violence, or even being forced into compliance. This was something much better.\n\nIt was a business opportunity.\n\n"And I get to have full control over Aris just for working for you?" he asked, putting on the suave business look he was known for.\n\n"You'll be able to do whatever you want, so long as it also benefits us and keeps this place stable. Grease the gears, so to speak. But let me make something clear." Within seconds the siren was muzzle-to-beak against Moonfeather, staring daggers. "You listen to us. You follow our orders whenever we say them. And if you fail, we will not hesitate to throw you out and let the crowds deal with you instead. Is that clear?"\n\nMoonfeather quickly nodded. "Clear as crystal.""
 hippogriff_abyss.17.a:0 "He will be a useful pawn."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.18.t:0 "Old Enemies"
 hippogriff_abyss.18.d:0 "Adagio was still visibly seething in anger when Aria and Sonata rushed into the throne room, having been urgently called there. "What is it, Adagio?" Sonata asked, beating her fellow siren to the punch.\n\n"They're still alive," Adagio replied bitterly.\n\nSonata blinked. "Who?"\n\n"Starswirl and those 'Pillars of Equestria'."\n\nAria's expression immediately shifted from standard boredom into rage similar to that of Adagio, while Sonata just gave a shriek and tried hiding under a nearby table. "They aren't here, are they?" she asked. "I don't want to be banished again, not so soon after we got out!"\n\nSonata's antics were enough to shake Aria out of her anger, making the purple siren roll her eyes. "Of course they aren't here, Sonata. We'd have noticed them by now if they were." She turned her attention back to Adagio. "But we can't just let them get away with what they did either."\n\nAdagio, in a rare moment of agreement, nodded. "No, we can't. I don't know how they're still alive after all this time, but they have to pay for our banishment. I've tracked one of the Pillars to Maregypt; the others seem to be in Equestria, though I have not found Starswirl yet. But I don't care what it takes. We will have our revenge, and nothing is going to stop us."\n\n"We'll do it together," Aria said.\n\n"Together!" Sonata reaffirmed, sliding out from under the table with a semi-serious expression, a very rare sight for the normally bubbly siren. The trio looked at each other once before nodding."

 #United Aris Resistance events
 hippogriff_abyss_resistance.1.t:0 "Unity in Strife"
 hippogriff_abyss_resistance.1.d:0 "In a nondescript building somewhere in Hippogriffia, three figures sat around a table. The first was Crack Lightning, the nationalist firebrand of Aris First. The second was Posada, charismatic leader of the Revolutionary Workers' Party. Lastly there was Princess Skystar, Queen Novo's daughter and heir apparent.\n\nCrack was the first to speak. "I'll admit, Princess, when I received your invitation to discuss uniting our resistance networks, I was open to the idea. But if I had known that unreliable, nutty communist was going to be here, I would have stayed home."\n\nPosada immediately shot back, "As if I'm happy to see you, you unabashed racist! You've become such a reactionary I'm surprised you can even lead a resistance!"\n\nAs the two continued to trade insults, Skystar's face contorted with frustration. Eventually her patience wore out, and she yelled as loud as she could, "Stop! You have to stop! Can't you see this is exactly what the Sirens want? It doesn't matter what ideology you prefer if there's no one left to support it! They've taken our friends, our relatives, even," she choked on the words, "even my mother, and here you are wasting time with stupid arguments!"\n\nPosada and Crack were stunned into silence. Skystar continued, calmer now, "I managed to send a messenger out to find the Elements of Harmony, but I need help keeping the resistance alive until they arrive. I thought you two could be that help. I heard you were friends once, so I was hoping you'd be willing to work together."\n\nBoth guests sat still, considering what the Princess had said. A moment later, Posada looked up. "Hey, Crack. Remember the first time we met, and how we talked for hours about the battle with the Storm King?"\n\nCrack's expression softened. "Heh, of course I remember. I think I see where you're going: it's time to save Hippogriffia once again?"\n\nPosada smiled. "Yes, but this time let's do it together.""

 hippogriff_abyss_resistance.2.d:0 "Being honest, Adagio was annoyed.\n\nShe had so been looking forward to taking revenge, to enact her plans to start the great and rightful conquests she imagined across this pitiful world. And then this has to happen. The few free hippogriffs remaining, in all their audacity, were actively choosing to fight back, setting back those conquests by who knows how long.\n\nIt was quite irritating.\n\n"The hippogriffs are proving more resilient then we thought," she told her partners, who had gathered once again in a spare room of the palace. "Every day they hinder us at every turn, and we have to expend more magic just to keep the rest in line. We have stopgaps, but this thorn needs to be removed."\n\n"That's obvious, Adagio," Aria replied in her ever-bored tone. "They're led by the former Princess Skystar, along with two nobodys. And they've gotten smarter and started using earplugs, so our magic doesn't affect them anymore."\n\n"Then why don't we just do what we always do?" Sonata asked. "We like, break up friendships all the time. It's how we get people to do what we want! Won't it be easier if they're fighting each other instead of us?"\n\nAria instinctively rolled her eyes. "Sonata, that's... actually an idea. Maybe you're not always the worst."\n\n"Really? Hey, wait a min-"\n\nAdagio cut them off before they could start fighting again. "Then it's settled.

After we had done multiple magical scans to make sure they weren't under the influence of the Sirens, they were let through to the throne room, where they explained that they had been sent by Princess Skystar. The once-royal of Aris had created a resistance against the Sirens, and she needed the help of Princess Twilight and the Elements of Harmony to defeat them.\n\nWhile sending the Elements to help the Princess would undoubtably make them grateful and could help restore the harmonic monarchy on Aris, it would also be very dangerous. If an Element were to be captured by the Sirens... well, nothing good could come of it. None of the Elements will also be available here to help, and should a war break out we would have to call them back no matter what the situation would be..."

 hippogriff_abyss_resistance.4.d:0 ""I didn't think we'd be back so soon," Twilight Sparkle said as she and her friends trotted along the shores of Aris, looking out for any sign of trouble. "When I first got Princess Skystar's letter, I didn't want to believe it, but... something is definitely very wrong here."\n\n"Yeah, yeah, so what?" Rainbow Dash asked. "We'll kick the sirens' flanks and be back in time for dinner, just like the Storm King!"\n\nRarity shook her head. "That was different, darling. These sirens have already captured almost all the hippogriffs in their spell, and they won't be easy to get rid of. We don't even know where to find Skystar, she could be anywhere!"\n\n"Or maybe she's waving at us over there!" Pinkie said bouncing while pointing a hoof inland. The other five ponies looked, and sure enough there the hippogriff was, frantically motioning for them to come over.\n\n"I'm so glad you're all here!" Skystar said as they approached. "I know you all must be really busy and all back in Equestria, but the sirens have got Mom and I didn't know anyone else who could help, so I sent a letter hoping you would get it and here you are!"\n\nRainbow Dash waved a hoof brushing off the remarks. "Don't worry about it," she said, "that's what friends do. So, how can we help?"\n\nThe Princess looked around before leaning in. "It's not safe here. I know a place we can go, and I'll tell you everything there. This way!"\n\nThe ponies looked at each other before following Skystar close behind. They didn't know how exactly they were going to defeat this new threat, but they all knew one thing; they would help Skystar and the other hippogriffs free their homeland, in whatever way they could."

 hippogriff_abyss_resistance.5.d:0 "Raft Wood swam between the underwater coral and seaweed beneath Seaquestria, desperately trying to put as much ocean as he could between it and himself. For months now he had been held prisoner there by the sirens, unable to return to Aris after being completely caught by surprise during their coup. He had nearly given up all hope on ever being able to see the light of day again, until tonight. He had woke up to find his cell door left open, a single note floating in the water.\n\n"Get to Aris and find us. The resistance needs you. -Princess Skystar"\n\nHe didn't know how the Princess had done it, but he wasn't going to question it. Skystar was right, he needed to get back to the mainland. If they were mounting a resistance, he needed to do his patriotic duty to help, no matter what. He just needed to be careful, and made sure that he didn't get caught or enthralled before he could find wherever they were on Aris.\n\nAs Raft Wood swam off, however, he never noticed the pair of eyes watching from the darkest shadows, nor the malicious grin forming right below them. Everything was going to plan."

 hippogriff_abyss_resistance.6.d:0 "Crack Lightning entered the meeting room in a hurry. Skystar and many other resistance leaders were already there. In the center of the room was Raft Wood, the founder of Aris First. Crack grimaced. Although they had once worked together, he had always considered Raft to be a rival, not a partner.\n\nCrack turned to one of the guards. "What have you learned?"\n"Well sir, he wasn't followed, and he doesn't seem to be enthralled, but we can't be sure."\n"Thank you." Crack approached Raft, getting uncomfortably close. "Now Raft, would you care to explain how you managed to escape from the Sirens?"\n\nRaft raised an eyebrow, but his expression quickly shifted to a smug grin. "Certainly Crack. After many months languishing in captivity, I was close to giving up. But in my darkest hour..."\nHe suddenly flung himself down in front of Skystar. On his knees, he reached up to kiss her claw. "Your Royal Highness somehow opened my cell and slipped me this note!"\n\nRaft handed the short note to a stunned Skystar. "I am eternally grateful to you Princess. You are noble and wise, like your mother. It would be my honor to aid the resistance however I can."\nSkystar read the note and frowned. "Raft, I'm glad you got away safely. But I didn't write this note, and I certainly didn't arrange your escape."\n\nThe whole room gasped. Crack roared, "He is under the Sirens' Spell!"\nRaft rose to defend himself. "Preposterous! I think I would know if I were enthralled!"\n"Really!? How would you know!? How can you be sure you aren't!?"\nRaft looked uneasy. "I, I... I don't know, but I'm asking you to trust me!"\nCrack faced the assembled resistance members. "This griff is clearly a Siren plant, meant to destroy us from the inside. To save our movement, we must execute him immediately."\n\nCrack was normally very persuasive, but as he read the room he realized the others had no intention of executing Raft. He scowled. "Well, I will not have anything to do with him, or anygriff who follows him!" he said, leaving in a huff."

He read over the latest intelligence reports, destroying the most sensitive documents immediately. He was interrupted when the door opened and two Hippogriffs entered. The first was one of his agents, the second was a child no more than 10 years old.\n\n"Hey featherbrains, what do you think you think you're doin'? Don't bring a kid into my safehouse!"\n"Take it easy, boss," he replied, frowning. "She's my niece. Her parents got enthralled, and I'm all she's got left. Can you let her stay with us for a while?"\nBlunt observed the sullen expression on the child's face. "Eh, alright, but you better keep an eye on her. Welcome to Aris First, kid."\n\nThe child perked up at the mention of their organization's name. "Are you guys really Aris First?"\nHer uncle beamed. "You bet we are!"\n"Or what's left of it, anyways" added Blunt.\nThe girl began to smile in earnest. "Does that mean I get to meet Crack Lightning and Raft Wood, and help fight back against the Sirens?"\n\nHer uncle tensed, and Blunt frowned. "Listen kid. If you're lucky, you might get to meet the Ace one day. But you're better off not meeting Raft, trust me."\nNow the girl looked puzzled. Her uncle anticipated the next question. "When Raft Wood escaped, Crack Lightning accused him of being a Siren spy. Half of Aris First stayed true to the Ace, like us, while the other half followed Raft."\n"Oh, ok." She paused to think. "But is Raft Wood really controlled by the Sirens?"\n\nThe door slammed open as another Hippogriff entered. Completely breathless, he took a minute to recover and then stammered, "Raft's faction is gone."\nBlunt froze. "What do you mean they're gone?"\n"Every Aris First cell loyal to Raft has gone dark. The leadership's still trying to figure out what happened, but they think our worst fears have come to pass."\nFor a moment everyone was silent. Both the girl and her uncle grew very pale. Finally Blunt turned to her and said, "Well kid, you got your answer.""

That left the remaining sirens to decide what to do with her.\n\n"Did you really think you'd get anywhere fighting us?" Aria asked Posada, the latter refusing to look at either of the sirens. "You're lucky Adagio isn't here, she'd probably think of some creative way to humiliate you before giving you a performance. Personally, I think life imprisonment will suit you just fine."\n\n"What?" Sonata asked, curious. "Why?"\n\nAria rolled her eyes before turning to face her fellow siren. "Because she's still a threat, Sonata. The hippogriffs listened to her, we can't let her just walk away even if she's under our influence. It's too dangerous."\n\nSonata made a weird expression, one she made whenever she was thinking really hard. "But like, we beat her! She won't hate us anymore after we sing. And look at this hat I found she had!" She pulled out a neon cap, one formerly worn by Posada with a hydrogen atom symbol on it. "It's so cool! Do you think I can ask her to make me one?"\n\n"No, Sonata." At this point Aria's voice was taking on a dangerously impatient tone. "We are not letting her go, and you are not asking her for a stupid hat."\n\n"It's not stupid! You're just no fun!"\n\n"Am not!"\n\n"Are too!"\n\nPosada watched from below, still in chains, simply confused at the display the two sirens were putting on before her.

Life was great, he had friends, he had money, and he was content.\n\nHowever, one day, there was a commotion outside the school. There was a minority of Seaponies that also went to the school, a recent initiative put forward when Queen Novo was in power in an attempt to promote racial equality in the Capital. They of course transformed into Hippogriffs to take the classes, but would often take breaks to nearby available pools during their free time.\n\nFor some reason there was a mob forming, barring entry to the Seapony students. Corundum Tenderquill couldn't think of any reason why there would be such a commotion and ventured further into the crowd to get a better look. Weren't they all supposed to be united after all?\n\nWhen he finally got to a position where he could see the Seapony-turned-Hippogriff students, something inside him clicked. He didn't know what it was or how it happened, but he could see clearly now. Why did these Seaponies deserve to go to THE finest institute in the country, taking spots that hard-working Hippogriffs deserve? All they did was flop around all day and sunbathe, while the Hippogriffs do all the work!\n\nFilled with righteous anger, Corundum Tenderquill joined the mob, certain that his school would be a better place if these no-good lazy fish went back to their sea.

 ### LEADERS #####
 HIP_POSADA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 14th of May, 980 in Seaquestria.\n\n§YBiography§!: For most of her childhood, Posada was ostracised by her peers. But she liked it that way, it left her more time to explore and play with her imaginary friends. She became an apprentice bookmaker in her teenaged years. When she first went to the surface, she looked upon the stars in wonder and often would stargaze while contemplating if there were creatures on other worlds. It was on one such night she accidentally drifted over towards Zebrican territory and was captured by the Storm King's forces.\n\nPosada was chained inside the cargo hold of an airship full of looted trophies and treasures from Colthage. During the long journey she suffered at the hands of her yeti captors, but one night she was able to break free of her shackles. Sneaking through the ship's hold, she was seeking to make a quick escape and then follow the stars home when a flash of green light caught her attention.\n\nThe light ebbed from out the crack in the lid of a large golden chest intricately carved with images of horned beasts and bowing goats. Unable to help herself, she broke the chains and opened the lid. What she saw would change her forever. Images flashed before her eyes, images of things nogriff should ever know. Images of conflict, strife, poverty and the stars, so many stars. She saw galaxies at the scale of atoms. She saw how stars burned. And more, much more, she could not understand.\n\nIt is unknown how she returned to Hippogriffia. Her mind was broken, and it was months before she could talk in coherent sentences again. Shortly after the Storm King's defeat, a copy of the works of Caramel Marks crossed her desk at work. She found the book as a symbol that she was destined to rediscover what the chest had shown her and to free everycreature from the shackles of capitalism and monarchy. She founded the Revolutionary Workers' Party and quickly started preaching her ideology to every hippogriff and seapony she could. Now with the RWP in power, the interstellar revolution is upon creaturekind.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Neither"
 HIP_POSADA_SAD_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 14th of May, 980 in Seaquestria.\n\n§YBiography§!: "Everything I did, I did for the revolution."\n\nPosada has believed in the promise of communism for years, and has seen with her own eyes how it benefits the world. But little by little, her idealism has cracked. Reactionaries, once met with rehabilitation, gradually became imprisoned for life and later simply shot.\n\nThe world looks grimmer every day, and the rare rays of light in her life gradually distanced themselves from her, as if fearing being contaminated themselves. Few indeed are the associates she genuinely enjoys the company of anymore, and fewer still the creatures who say what she wishes they would: that she's gone too far and has to stop. \n\nOceans of blood have been spilled at her directive, ruthless operations justified by the fact that this is necessary for a better world. That excuse still holds water, but it seems drier than it once did. The revolution is worth dying for, but is it truly worth massacring for?\n\nPosada knows in her heart that she has become a monster, one the Storm King would welcome with a smile as a sister-in-arms. The only thing that gives her the energy to rise from bed is the terrible knowledge that there are so many worse monsters still left to slay.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Neither"
 HIP_POSADA_GOODEND_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 14th of May, 980 in Seaquestria.\n\n§YBiography§!: Communism has won against all odds, and the dream has been fulfilled. Throughout the lands of Revolutionary North Zebrica, suffering, poverty, and scarcity are things of the past. Nuclear reactors dot the land like gemstones, powering entire cities and providing the state with an ever-growing supply of fissile material. The scientific method has been applied to politics, and government is administrated with maximum efficiency with an eye towards fairness. The stars shine as bright as the souls of the creatures building this utopia.\n\nPosada has known for years that this world was not the only to harbor life. It'd simply be impossible to have only one planet with creatures upon it. Somewhere out there, in the vast cosmos, are Star People, creatures who have moved past the troubles of reaction and violence, and formed glorious civilizations aglow amongst the constellations. \n\nRevolutionary North Zebrica, once the small state known as Hippogriffia, has become a beacon calling out to the stars. Communism has prevailed here, and grand efforts are underway to contact the astral comrades. \n\nPosada has come far from the broken madfish she once was. Her soul has crystallized with a clear purpose: to win the great war against reaction, to uplift the lives of all creatures around the world, and to reach out to the Star People and gain their aid in creating a better, more loving world.\n\nThe aliens will come - and Posada will welcome them with open fins.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Neither"

 CRACK_LIGHTNING_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 4th of February, 977 in Harmonizing Heights.\n\n§YBiography§!: If you'd asked anygriff what Crack Lightning's future held after his rise to fame as an ace pilot in the Storm War, none would have guessed he planned on becoming the voice of the Aris First nationalist movement, much less the supreme commander of Aris' armed forces or the de facto ruler of Hippogriffia.\n\nFew now remember that Crack Lightning opposed the move to Seaquestria following the Storm King's arrival, nor that until his rise to fame he had never particularly cared for traditionalism, for all of that has been wiped away by the bombastic fervour of his commitment to Aris First after his round-the-world flight.\n\nPassionate, young, aggressive, adventurous, seductive, he was everything Aris First needed to contrast the stoic Raft Wood and to rile up the youth into a nationalistic frenzy. Few suspected that his ambitions went far beyond the isolationism of his colleague, and those that did notice found their objections falling on deaf ears as his influence grew and his followers grew more zealous. Now with Raft Wood out of the picture, Hippogriffia is under the full control of Crack Lightning, and there is little doubt that "The Ace," as his followers call him, will put the country's considerable might towards creating the Hegemony he dreams of.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofus"
 RAFT_WOOD_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 13th of June, 950 in Seaquestria.\n\n§YBiography§!: Advisor, populist, nationalist, disgrace, leader. Raft Wood has been many things over the years, rising through Novo's court to become one of her chief advisors during the difficult days of the Storm King. It was his idea to migrate the hippogriff population to Seaquestria, and in the aftermath of the triumphant Storm War he saw his influence fade.\n\nBlamed for everything that went wrong during the isolation, called a coward by hippogriffs and foreigners alike, Raft Wood lost his influence in the court but never his faith in Queen Novo or Hippogriffia. His waning period turned out to be a cocoon, from which emerged a transformed Raft Wood: reaffirming everything he believed in, he masterminded the nationalist Aris First movement alongside ace pilot Crack Lightning, becoming the first to bring mass politics to Hippogriffia.\n\nA vocal supporter of the Anti-Harmonic Activities Committee and the superiority of the Arisian way of life, Raft Wood found his fortunes rising as nationalism and Harmony blended together in the popular consciousness and, eventually, the law of the land in Hippogriffia. When Novo appointed him chairpony of the AHAC and granted him and Crack Lightning extensive emergency powers, Raft Wood expected to comfortably lead Aris into a new era free of foreign influence.\n\nTo his dismay, he soon found himself dragged into two conflicts: the raging North Zebrican War on the one fin, and a shadow conflict with his former compatriot Crack Lightning on the other, who intended to use Raft Wood's movement to transform Aris into a fascist dictatorship. With Lightning exposed and apprehended, Raft Wood stands as the leader of [HIP.GetName], nothing stands in Raft Wood's way of pursuing a strong, united, and pure Aris, save perhaps his own nagging doubts at how deeply Crack Lightning's venomous ideology has seeped into his followers.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofus"
 HIP_RAZORBEAK_LEADER_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 1st of December, 971 in Winggarden.\n\nA harsh and demanding officer, Colonel Razorbeak has spent most of her career as an instructor at Hippogriffia's military academies, attempting to weed out weakness among future officers. Her involvement in the Phalanx, once considered a career-limiting move, led her into Crack Lightning's inner circle during his brief rule as dictator of Aris. Even when the rest of the Phalanx turned on him, Razorbeak remained loyal.\n\nLightning's assassination and the bloody fighting which followed has seen Razorbeak take over as Supreme Commander of Aris, unleashing her signature cold-hearted violence on those who failed The Ace. She now rules with an iron claw, seeking to weed out weakness among the entire Hippogriff race in the same way she once did to cadets at the academy, now completely unrestrained by law and oversight. The people of Aris once called Crack Lightning a tyrant, but Razorbeak is determined to show them real tyranny, and to mould the next generation into a nation of fanatics who will succeed where their parents failed.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"

 
 HIP_SIR_ADAGIO_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Time Immemorial\n\n§YBiography§!: Since recorded history, even before the time of the Princesses of Equestria, when monsters ruled and cowed the native ponies, the sirens have existed in this world. A group of three, they traveled the land spreading fear and hatred with their magical voices, plunging Equestria into further disharmony and feeding off of the negative energy that followed. Only the creation of the legendary Pillars of Harmony were able to defeat them, tricking the trio into banishment at the bottom of the Mareiana Trench, far below the ocean waves for over a thousand years.\n\nAdagio Dazzle is the leader of the three sirens, and for good reason. Even without magic her voice carries with it a stunning amount of charisma, and her elaborate plans are both long and rarely ever fail. Yet despite that she is extremely egotistical and controlling even compared to her fellow sirens, and believes that only she can lead the three to their rightful places as the masters of the entire world.\n\nAdagio believes everything can be solved using their magic and their voices, a sentiment not exactly shared with her partners. She sees Aria as too distracted by her "what ifs" and a constant annoyance due to her constant fights with Sonata, who she sees as a loose cannon at best and an active hinderance at worst. Still, she works with them for a shared dream and her birthright; for everyone in this world to adore her.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"
 HIP_SIR_ARIA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Time Immemorial\n\n§YBiography§!: Since recorded history, even before the time of the Princesses of Equestria, when monsters ruled and cowed the native ponies, the sirens have existed in this world. A group of three, they traveled the land spreading fear and hatred with their magical voices, plunging Equestria into further disharmony and feeding off of the negative energy that followed. Only the creation of the legendary Pillars of Harmony were able to defeat them, tricking the trio into banishment at the bottom of the Mareiana Trench, far below the ocean waves for over a thousand years.\n\nAria Blaze is the serious and level-headed member of the sirens, being a stark contrast to her partners and their eccentricity. While being just as capable of manipulation as Adagio, Aria concerns herself more with what could happen, no matter how unlikely those situations could be. Her plans and backup plans are thorough and numerous, which could even be described as paranoia in some cases.\n\nHaving learned of the new world and the vast differences from the old, Aria is a proponent of less-magical solutions to problems she and the others come across, seeing them as more reliable than continuing to trust in their magic never failing after her banishment. While she does listen to Adagio, she sees her fellow siren as too obsessed with world domination and egotistical to see the possibility of their plans falling apart, and Aria's annoyance with Sonata's carefree attitude has led to many an argument. Still, she works with them side by side, for Aria knows that her fellow sirens are the only creatures she can trust completely.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"
 HIP_SIR_SONATA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Time Immemorial\n\n§YBiography§!: Since recorded history, even before the time of the Princesses of Equestria, when monsters ruled and cowed the native ponies, the sirens have existed in this world. A group of three, they traveled the land spreading fear and hatred with their magical voices, plunging Equestria into further disharmony and feeding off of the negative energy that followed. Only the creation of the legendary Pillars of Harmony were able to defeat them, tricking the trio into banishment at the bottom of the Mareiana Trench, far below the ocean waves for over a thousand years.\n\nSonata Dusk is an outlier among the three, severely lacking in any sort of skill regarding intentional manipulation. Often forgetful and ditzy, Sonata legitimately enjoys music of all kinds, including music being played by others. She hates boredom, and prefers doing things and being in the moment, as opposed to the other two with their long plans and eyes on the future.\n\nSonata frequently gets into arguments with Aria over trivial matters, which constantly results in Adagio having to intervene in their pointless arguments. This has led to Sonata seeing Aria as "no-fun", and Adagio as the leader with the evil plans. The result of this has been her being the siren most involved with the enthralled population, preferring to get away from her partners often when possible and occasionally unwittingly doing something useful in the process. Despite it all, though, she still cares about the trio and does whatever she can to help, even if it isn't always useful.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"
