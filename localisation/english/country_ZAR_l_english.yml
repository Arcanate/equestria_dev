 ### Events ###
 
 zarantia.1.t:0 "The Aguellid"
 zarantia.1.d:0 "Time was like water, flowing on endlessly, and as much as you grasped for it, it just flowed around your hooves. Even if you achieved great things, time could sweep it away so easily, leaving you standing in the ashes of your successes. Nothing lasted, not even nations, and Mekiouzza Ataghan felt her age weigh down on her. Two years ago, all had been right in the world, and yet then it all had come crashing down.\n\nWas this the legacy she would leave her beloved daughter? A nation that had fled into the desert with its tail between its legs, a capitol in the hooves of criminals and warlords, and a people who had lost faith in her. Decades of work, undone in a hoofful of months.  Now she was back where she started all those years ago, now an older, more tired zebra.\n\n"You are brooding, mother." Umalez voice came from behind Mekiouzza as she came up to stand by her mother's side. "You know that you do not need to do this, right? You can retire now, and let me deal with Tobuck. Perhaps the time has come for a younger and more vigorous zebra to take charge? Then you can stay in Agzhat and eat dates. Perhaps it would be a more fitting challenge for you."\n\n"Girl, I will have you caned." Mekiouzza gave her daughter a freezing glare. "I thought I would have peace when your father passed, but his barbed tongue has jumped into your mouth."\n\n"No rest for the wicked, mother, and there is not a greater villain in Zarantia than you." Umalez smile reached from ear to ear.\n\n"That's it, where can I find a cane?" Mekiouzza started looking around herself. She was certain she had seen some reeds she could use somewhere.\n\n"Oh but mother, if you need support to walk I can have one made for you!" Umalez laughed as she fled her mother's wrath."
 zarantia.1.a:0 "I am not dead yet, you insolent whelp!"
 
 zarantia.2.t:0 "The Lost City"
 zarantia.2.d:0 "Menes Amasdag - a trader from Tobuck - had arrived early that morning, and he carried with him news from Tobuck. Said news were enough to make the blood boil, yet Mekiouzza sat calmly on her pew as Menes spoke of Pea Shooter's plans.\n\n"And they say Equestria is the land of friendship," she sighed when Menes was done. "Is there no depth to which he won't sink? Not enough that he squats in our city, he even has the temerity to try to negotiate?"\n\n"It seems that way, your majesty. He asks for one year, and says that at the end of the year the city 'will be given back to you' as he put it... and though he is impudent, I humbly request that the crown repays his diplomacy in kind. Tobuck, much like your tribes, was devastated by the storm king, and though the ponies long for your return, sparing them more violence is the right thing to do."\n\n"A thief has crawled into your house and taken possession of it. Do you drive him out, or sit outside your house to patiently wait for when he deigns to leave?" Mekiouzza responded, Menes bowing his head in response.\n\n"I simply fear that threats, however justified, will only impact what little trade that still can flow to the city. Whatever you choose, though, know that the ponies of Tobuck still long for your return."" 
 zarantia.2.a:0 "Pea Shooter is a rat, and he shall be aware of where he stands."
 zarantia.2.b:0 "It is humiliating, but we can ill afford pride."
 
 zarantia.3.t:0 "From the Chaos, Growth"
 zarantia.3.d:0 "As you reach the highlands of northern Zarantia, the desert slowly gives way to rolling grasslands, which in turn become hills criss-crossed by small brooks. These lands are as fertile as you will find anywhere in Zarantia, and the valleys are filled with olive groves, fields of sorghum and cassava and even vineyards. Cool winds blow in from the north, contesting the hot, dry Zebhara, and gives the region periods of refreshing cool.\n\nHere, nested on the slopes of a large ridge, lies the city of Aghzat. It is a modest place by international standards, with buildings out of mud bricks and rammed earth. The buildings are - unlike the Zonician cities of the coast - built for defense as much as anything else, with many of them almost akin to small fortresses. Yet it is also a place of rapid change. Before the storm king, Colthaginian and Maregyptian investors had both seen the potential in this city, and industries have sprung up in the region. Foreigners are a more common sight than ever before as it escaped destruction and has became one of the few places still fully intact, and thus the best place to do business. The merchants and craftsponies that fled Tobuck and Pea Shooter's reign have settled among the Zarantians as well, doing their part in helping to raise the city up.\n\nThough the last years have been hard on the Aguellid and on Zarantia, for Aghzat, they have been good."
 zarantia.3.a:0 "It's no Tobuck, but it's a good home."

 zarantia.4.t:0 "A Changing World" 
 zarantia.4.d:0 ""Why did we take Tobuck, my daughter?" Mekiouzza asked Umalez before taking a sip of her tea. "Not 'when', or 'under what pretext', but why?"\n\n"Because it was our gateway to modernity. Holding Tobuck would let our people rise to become akin to Colthage, or Maregypt."\n\n"Yes, we would seize a modern city, leave our old ways behind and become like the zonicians, with no trouble. That was why we failed. Yes, failed. Our people are bound by traditions millennia in the making. The future is like the Emerald Sea, vast, inviting, and we galloped out of the desert towards it when we took Tobuck... but the sea can drown you. You can become lost in it, and it is no less deadly than the Zebhara. If we do not have ourselves, then what do we have?"\n\n"And losing our old ways to start playing at being zonicians would make us what? Imposters, dancing to a foreign tune not ours?" Umalez nodded as she noticed mother's point. "But at the same time, that unwillingness to change is what lost us Tobuck."\n\n"Was it?" Mekiouzza asked pointedly. "Or was it blind faith that progress would be inevitable, and that my people had to lose themselves in order to be safe? Or..." she smiled wryly. "Maybe that is just simple fear speaking? It's so easy to flee and refuse to give up anything, and then you've already lost. Clinging to what drags you down can drown you even in shallower seas. It is a difficult issue, but that is why we are here, my daughter...""  
 zarantia.4.a:0 ""We must make sure that they won't lose themselves.""
 zarantia.4.b:0 ""We serve so that the Imazeeb can change on their terms.""

 zarantia.5.t:0 "The Path to Unity" 
 zarantia.5.d:0 ""At times, I do envy the rulers of other nations." Umalez murmured as more tea was poured for her. "Their people might bicker and fight for dominance, but they are still part of the same nation. Being the Aguellid of Zarantia seems to be more akin to herding dragons."\n\n"It is," Mekiouzza responded flatly. "Zarantia is not something written into the fabric of the land. It is an agreement between tribes, and if they feel that the deal is not honored, they will no longer stick around. The question is what the remedy will be."\n\n"In Griffonia, the griffons' empire was brought together through force, and all I've read says that the empire had no shortage of prideful or stubborn peoples. Then again... their empire's a shadow of what it was, and their leader frail."\n\n"Indeed, and yet at least they reached that far. That is more than you can say for many nations. Tribes like ours have worked together in concord, but conquest is how kingdoms have been built."\n\n"And yet aren't these kingdoms rocked by demands for democracy?" Umalez mused. "A hoofful of dragons will defeat an army of sheep. It's true that a cowed people follows more easily, but might not a nation of free zebras be even stronger?"\n\n"High-faluting ideals are dangerous, my daughter...""   
 zarantia.5.a:0 ""If things continue as they are, unity must be forced.""
 zarantia.5.b:0 ""But you are right. Our people must come together on their own terms.""

 zarantia.6.t:0 "A Settling People" 
 zarantia.6.d:0 ""The zonicians are an amusing sort." Mekiouzza said out of the blue. "We have been their neighbours for untold centuries, and yet so many of them think we do not live in towns or villages at all. I recall this one playwright in Colthage who wrote a play where an Imazeeb mare was withering away because she was 'trapped' in the city. I had the misfortune to watch it once when visiting, and I did not know if I was to collapse in laughter, or retrieve a cane and go find the playwright."\n\n"It is so strange. Aghzat lies close to their lands, do they not know how many of us have been settled for centuries?"\n\n"I guess they do not consider those proper Imazeeb. In their mind, you must be nomadic to be a true Imazeeb. Yet... when you consider the opposition between the nomads and the settled, I suppose I see where they get confused."\n\n"How do you manage it?" Umalez asked her mother. "How do you find a balance between the settled and the nomadic?"\n\n"I don't, not really." Mekiouzza said. "Their needs are nigh completely opposed, and perfect balance is a precarious position. To favour none is to be able to trust none, and you need to find those who stand by you utterly. As for me...""

Aren't we sworn to aid her? Would she be a threat to us?"\n\n"A greater threat than most zebras you will meet, but not in battle." Wasif smiled at the naive remark. "She is a snake, coiling herself around you, and before you know it, her venom has made you content with being in her clutches. For how could you say no? I remember at one gathering, where she met with Zawgha Amsarmud. You would have thought they would be cold with each other, but Mekiouzza met her with the warmth you give a daughter, inquired about Zawgha's niece and whether she had had her foal yet. Within weeks, she was like a mother to all in their tribe."\n\n"I don't understand. Isn't that a good thing? She's hospitable."\n\n"She ingratiated herself with the Amsarmud like she was everyone's mother, and before long they were so woven into her schemes that they could not pull away without ripping themselves apart. Now they walk by her side, so integrated into the greater Ataghan that they are no longer a whole, but part of something else. That's why she's dangerous. She sees no Talat, or Amsarmud, or Ataghan. All she sees is Imazeeb, and as long as she is Aguellid, she will defend and care for them.""

Yet, his age and his wisdom shone through his obscuring clothes as he placed the books down before Mekiouzza.\n\n "My life's work, such as it is. Alas, I return before you a defeated Zebra." Mekiouzza, whose hoof had travelled over the first book's cover, raised an eyebrow.\n\n"I count eight books, each of them sizeable. Can there be so much in the art of alchemy you still have not learned?"\n\n"For each and everything I learned, I realized there were ten things more to discover." Wiwurgh sighed. "My life's goal, I am afraid, was a far to ambitious one for one single zebra to master. The world is great, greater than we realize, and when we rise to challenge it, it reminds us of how small we are. You saw that a long time ago, did you not? That was why you have sought to unite our people, and elevate us to something different?" Mekiouzza did not answer, only smiled wryly at him, and Wiwurgh bowed his head towards her. "

Tens of thousands of zebras from hundreds of tribes are pouring into the city, each tribe a colourful parade of wealth and power. Yet the mood is not tense, but hopeful. Foals stand on the rooftops, raining down flower petals over the arriving chieftains as music and song fills the air, and as the chieftains arrive at the Aguellid's castle, they are welcomed like kin by the Aguellid.\n\nSome came ready for arguments, straining against the Aguellid's overreach, but they found themselves embraced and led to a sumptious feast before they could say much. Others, who had hoped to converse in private with the Aguellid to curry favour were gently but firmly kept among their peers. Outside the castle, the tribeszebras who came with their chieftains are treated to feasts as well.

Years have passed, friends were lost and gained, enough scars were cast on her body to make her look like a battleground map, and those naive, fresh eyes were replaced with a steely, temperate gaze.\n\nAlongside her as she looked backwards is the Ironbreaker Warriors, her battle brothers and sisters from home and abroad. Many of those she left with would never return home, their belongings and sometimes ashes being carried in a simple wagon to the families that even after all this years, waited either their return or a closure. Alongside these fallen brothers however, were many faces fresh from her home, folk that she extended a hoof in friendship and family, when the world had all but cast them down.\n\nThe Ironbreaker Warriors are not the same group that left this village that day. Bonds carved in battle, Ponies and even Gryphons stand alongside her ranks, each one carrying their particular wisdom and experience on each of their motions.\n\nZawgha is not the same.

For centuries, the Zebhara has been the fastest route to cross the continent, but there are few who have been able to brave the sand ocean. The Imazeeb are among those who have the strength, the skill and the willpower to conquer this desolate region, and from Maregypt to Colthage, merchants have eagerly hired their services to help speed them along their way.\n\nIn the wake of the Storm King's rampage, the caravans that once trekked these dangerous routes have all but disappeared, yet the flow of and desire for commerce has not abated, and there are those who long for the routes to open again. Tobuck might currently be lost to us, but our services are still desired across Zebrica, and we are still here to provide." #Zarantia used to be an important route for the trans-zebharan trade, and though it was kinda in shambles after the storm king, it's time to get it going again.

At several points, its appearance caused worry, even fear, as there were those who thought the approaching caravan was an invasion. Thankfully, our guards could smooth things over, and our merchants could deal in their goods along the route.\n\nThe lands we travelled are still dealing with the aftermath of the Storm King's invasions, and the still devastated towns and villages we saw make it all too clear that it will take months, if not years, to restore them. Yet, life goes on, and there is still the need for trade.\n\nMaybe the goods needed are more practical than they used to be, but the buyers are no less interested.

We love the rivers that briefly flows through our lands in the winter. We love the times that the rain brings the desert alive with countless flowers and plants, and we love the fields that bring plentiful harvests of sweet fruits and filling grains.\n\nThe Zonicians have lived so long along their verdant coastlines, where the soil provides all that they could dream of, that when they see us eking out a living in the Zebhara, they presume it must be a matter of desire rather than necessity. As we carve the wadis and the dried riverbeds into canals and reservoirs, treasuring every drop we are given, we remember Tobuck, that city between the rivers. There, the coastline was ours, and the ponies we liberated from their Warzenan oppressors were our friends. We traded, we feasted together, found love with each other and worked together to build a future together.\n\nTobuck might be lost to us, at least for now, but as we wait to regain that city, we wait, and we carve the desert to give what little it can." #Zarantia might be born in the desert, but they don't really like it. Taking Tobuck was more than just economy, it was a way to get away from the desert. Still, they have managed to make a living in it, and that's cool.

Mekiouzza has seen first hoof the broken families, the destroyed cities and abandoned tents, the scorched lands of her people, and their despair gripped her heart. The horrors he inflicted on her people were an unforgivable crime, and if she were any lesser, she would have fallen in a deep despair, or a maddened sense of revenge.\n\nNot to say she didn't desire revenge, but this revenge wouldn't come from blood and fire, but by picking up the pieces left from her home, and reforge into something greater, a whole larger than the Storm King ever saw before it blighted them with their presence.\n\n"As you can see, my Queen the rebuilding of Shizra is going apace." An assistant shows her ledger after ledger, as well as reports. "...at the pace of everything, reconstruction should be done within the month."\n\n"Not only reconstruction. Improvement." She said, to the light confusion of the assistant. "Shizra didn't have schools to teach it's youth. It didn't have a pier so it's people could take from the bounty of the rivers effectively." She continued, pushing herself to stand from her chair, gazing upon the window with a thoughtful, stern expression. "It didn't have plowshares and shoves, to work it's riverbed soil into the nature's bounty. I trust those means were all given to them now?"\n\n"Yes, my Queen."\n\n"Good. You're dismissed."

Do you doubt our commitment to them?" Grumbling starts to come from the elder and the tribe representatives, one that the Queen simply lets it happen. None would dare accuse her after all, and yet, as they argued, it was clear amongst them the different interpretations of the oath; veterans and newly-picked representatives of the tribes argued amongst themselves on what they meant, and soon a dawning realization came to them, prompted by a single question.\n\nMekiouzza raised a single hoof, silencing the commotion, before she spoke again.\n\n"I do not doubt the commitment of the tribes to the promise, but how long has it been since those oaths were carved in words and paper? How many were here, so long ago, when they were made? I do not ask for a test of faith, but a renewal of those promises. An oath made, for a new age."\n\nShe gesticulates a hoof over all the leaders, a careful laid smile on her expression.\n\n"Look at our land, our people. How they've suffered, yet how they've grown. Even with the loss of Tobuck, the people of Zarantia rebuilt themselves, into something new. And a new Zarantia requires a renewed Confederation, a renewed vow. One that serves this new Zarantia we live upon."\n\nThe meeting would go without a hitch, the oaths and vows renewed, and if one or other trade deals happened between the like minded tribe leaders, well...That was just a plus after all, wasn't it?"

The rivers of Zarantia were always a beautiful gaze, but as she trotted on the pier of Tobuck and gazed upon that boundless, verdant sea, it was hard to not feel emotional; to not feel her chest flutter with pride, as once again her home claimed their gateway to the world.\n\nAnd the world laid out there, ripe to know her name. Ripe for Zarantia for one day, stand as high as their peers of Colthage and Maregypt. And, if she may allow herself a moment of arrogancy, to know the name of Queen Umalez on the tip of their tongues.\n\nTobuck returned to Zarantia and even with all the problems and logistics to renew, Umalez allowed herself to dream of possibilities that are yet to come, which didn't help her see the lightpost in front of her, her daydreams interrupted by the reality that she is not intangible."

She has heard rumors from friends within the Queen's Court about the ever increased foulness of the Queen's behavior and being called personally, the worst-case scenarios flow to her head like intrusive flies; did she do something wrong? Did she insult the Queen somehow? The tales of those that incurred her wrath were known far and wide. Her hooves moved automatically to her chambers, even as her mind ran a thousand analyses of her last days, trying to find which point she could have slighted Mekiouzza.\n\nShe entered her chambers to find a room smelling heavily of Incense, the queen reading on her table a map, marked and drew heavily, of the many tribes within Zarantia. The silence stretched for a long moment, the general having started to open her mouth to ask her queen what she needed before she turned and all but glared at her, shutting her up immediately.\n\n"I've tried, Zawgha, I did. I tried, again and again, to find common ground. To negotiate, to make Zarantia whole." She walked to her, worming her way around like a snake encircling her prey. "That was my mistake, truly. To trust that others could see the greater whole, a true union, something grander than you, or even me."\n\nShe mustn't have noticed her head lowering with each word of her ruler, for her hoof reached under her chin, pulling it upward again, staring at those yellow, sharp eyes, reading her like an open book, and Zawgha never felt so naked...so fragile.\n\n"I've realized that they didn't care. If Zarantia falls, it wouldn't affect them personally. Tobuck lays there, those renegades mocking us every moment, and the tribes are content to simply lay with their bellies up the sky, and wait the sun to scorch them dry." She released the hold on her jaw, and turned away, returning to her map. "I will not allow it. You will not allow it. Come here, and tell me how we can organize your warriors, Zawgha. There are a few tribes around here that could use a...persuasive push."\n\nThe general followed her as if she was in a trance, speaking in a dispassionate, emotionless tone on how to break the tribes' cohesion with her brothers and sisters as if she was an extension of the Queen's will. The memories of that meeting chilled her to the core, even as she was dismissed for the day.\n\nShe couldn't deny Mekiouzza, even if she wanted.

All around her village, pamphlets, and orators spoke of roaring machines of death in Colthage hooves, in vile wizardry from the Hippos, of each horrific way Zarantia was in danger. A deep, foreign fear set deep in her soul, and she couldn't help but fear for her own family...of what they could do to them. To her village. To her friends.\n\nThat is why, on the dawn of morning, she picked her father's rifle, and joined one of the conscription tents.

For they are not a scattered, aimless group of tribes led by sycophantic elders, but a nation, a people that gaze upon her for guidance; guidance that looks not to their own belly button, but something much bigger.\n\n"Please, Goddess Shams, lay your blessing to our beloved Aguellid! Our beloved Queen of Zarantia!" The priest echoed as he carefully laid open a box containing her new crown.

If they came here, and the sessions were plentiful enough, they would likely have to take residence within the city and need to communicate things back to their respective tribes.\n\nOn paper, it would seem she's giving up parts of her power, but the streamlining of the process of communicating with her people, and the convenience just meant that she simply could push more, quicker. With a giddiness she hadn't felt in ages did she, her daughter, and a few trusted aides put pen to quill, and sign up the structure of the Tribal Council, as well as the invitations for every tribe her census could measure.\n\nThey would be more welcome to join, after all.

A duel, against her own finest general; they won, and the Vulkans would have what they desired from her, a blind eye to their actions, and they would be bothered by her again, but if Wasif fell...they would submit, wholly and fully, to her cause, and her armies.\n\nShe didn't spare a single bit, a single resource, to broadcast that. She made her engineers carve the arena from stone! She imported radios and recording equipment, and sent and scattered them to where the wind would take them, together with her challenge!\n\nThe people of Zarantia would be witness to the question that they didn't dare voice in front of her: Is her people, her government, truly a better path than what they had stubbornly clung to, all this time?\n\nThe battle took the good part of an hour, witnesses clinging to their seats as visual witnesses, and she was sure families and entire clans sat around their radios, captivated by one of her aide's surprising ability at narrating the bout! Wasif fought as a Zebra possessed, but he only knew how to fight Zarantians. Zawgha was a warrior forged by coin, and battles abroad, and little by little, she led the attrition war until, with a final pommel strike on his chin, the zebra fell, and the crowd roared and clopped.\n\nThe next day, with the city of Agzhat as witnessed on that same arena, they saw the most vicious warrior of the country bent their hooves and kiss her, submitting himself and his tribe to her service, until the end of times."

His time as a caravan gave him a mindset of one, and he knew how to starve them: simply fund, and back the tribes and caravans that were more willing to play nice with them. A merchant, after all, is loyal to coin more than their tribesmen if they desire to make a profit, and by stealing the best caravaneers it would not only be the most stubborn merchants would bend over, but also their business.\n\nThey would either submit to the government, and receive aid and investment, or break, sell out, and he would be there to buy them and put it to better use.

And at the topic stood the queen and her princess, mediating, and subtly inserting their desired topics to the discussion, which tended to be accepted nonetheless.\n\nWithout her even noticing, the concept of Zarantia as a true, federalized nation, became more and more of a reality.

The desert holds a treasure that the Imzeeb have neglected for far....far too long."\n\nShe tapped her cane on the ground and looked at her daughter once again...instead of the stern, harsh expression that she had seemed to permanently wear for the good part of a year, there was only a kind, soft expression as she spoke candidly, from mother to daughter.\n\n"I want you to look at this, and I'll promise you, the next time you cross this street""

With external capital, we can push our development akin to an uncontrollable bolder, but for that, it needs to be moved downward. The Queen has sent her delegates and personal aides alongside the countries bordering us, and from all proposals, only two truly caught her eye\n\nColthage has been historically one of Zarantia's finest partners, having fought kin to kin in the long, bloodied history of North Zebrica. Their knowledge of metallurgy and its industrial tycoons could easily be the push her country needed.\n\nOn the other hoof, Maregypt's trading history is downright millenary, and its development in recent years has been by leaps, thanks to their investment towards the new technologies; a future that she desires to lead her nation herself.\n\nHowever, she can't play both sides, a mixed capital is mixed trouble.

 zarantia.29.d:0 "The sun shone brightly, scorching the tireless, dedicated workers as they chart, dig, and pave the sprawling network of the Royal Road. Of course, those aren't your usual workers, but many of the "prisoners" were freed from the tribes that aligned themselves with the Queen. While one would think that being liberated only to work heavy hoof work was an empty gesture, the knowledge of their fate had she not intervened would have been worse, and that kept them going.\n\nThrough day and night, through careful guidance from experienced travelers and their generational knowledge as foreigner builders with their technical know-how, have they carved a path in the desert, one enchanted too to withstand the test of tune and winds, all up to the sea of Menzaka.\n\nAnd when they, many of them that have never seen such a big "river" in their whole life, first laid eyes on the seemingly boundless blue.\n\nEven if nobody would know who they were, the road would outlast them. And one day, when those same foreign machines on wheels, boats, traders, and tourists came within their lands, their legacy would forever be enshrined on the path they've trotted upon.\n\nA fleeting, yet substantial feeling of accomplishment came to them, and those humble workers, so close to destiny as slaves, can't say they disliked it."

She, in her youth, had run laps around her country, and she became Aguellid got used to sending other people on that particularly grueling task, but the innovations of this new Millenium still left her vaguely confused.\n\nShe taps the microphone twice, glancing at one of the foreign "radio experts", as he nodded, and screamed in an odd language towards the other hippogriffs accompanying him. In a few moments, a radio would broadcast her speech across all radios on her country, and what better way to make the first, of hopefully many broadcasts, than severing one of her country's oldest crutches.\n\n"People of Zarantia. Tribes, Imazeebs, Ponies and all. When Tobuck was stolen from us, I've thought deeply of our future, our country's future! What kind of proud nation, proud queen, would have built a strong legacy to simply collapse by itself when we lost but a city! But a territory!"\n\n"I've decided that before my body returns to the desert and my soul wanders the endless winds, I would set upon the stone to which a nation, not a group of collected tribes, but one, an individual home we share under the sky, would stood and grow! Growing pains have certainly been felt, and many detractors endeavored to stay against these changes, but still we are undeterred. Still we are stronger!"\n\n"Yet, one topic, many wish I wouldn't topic. One that, no matter how neutral the tribe stood, still dabbled on it. To put the chains on the defeated, the prisoners, the spoils of conflict. You might be glaring, you might be shutting off these radios, but I speak of a plain truth...it has no future in the Zantara of tomorrow. To hold one in chains is to consign them to a fate not of their control, neither to their freedom, and isn't freedom one of our main values?!"\n\nAnd, on the memory of every clansperson, on every slave owner who hurriedly shut down that lasted device, and carved in the heart of every soul clad in metaphorical and literal chains, were the next words..."

 zarantia.31.d:0 ""There we go. From this point onward, you're not a slave anymore." Umalez said, signing the papers with practiced ease, her hoof already sore from the months upon months of signing releases of service, one after the other, something that her oldest servant noticed with a chuckle.\n\nIt would have been much easier if her mother simply made a declaration, and let the army take care but she feared the reprisal from the chieftains; only after weeks of endless negotiation, butting heads, and untold horseshoes are thrown they could finally make some progress, but all of them required either her and her mother's signature, which all but condemned them to their chambers, signing towering pillars after towering pillars of quills to be sent to houses and clans.\n\nThe proper procedure, yes. Murder to her wrists? Doubly so!\n\nHer maid, Adowa, raised alongside her took the quill, staring at it for a long moment, her expression conflicted.\n\n"...Are you expelling me, Ummy? Did I do something wrong?"\n\n"W-what, no! You're a free mare! Your family has been our slaves since the times my mother had my age, don't you want to be free?"\n\n"...W-where would I even go?"\n\nShe stared at her lady, her friend, her wide, nervous eyes glancing at the zebra she grew alongside with. Of course, many of these slaves were from generations, where else would they go? She remembered something Mother did for those...what was it?\n\nAs if a lightbulb lit over her head, she quickly pulled a blank small quill, writing the terms of a quick contract, before hooving it to her, and motioning her to read. She seemed confused for a moment, her expression melting into peace as she read more and more.\n\n"I hereby declare Adowa Nefertiti to be the Princess Umalez of Zarantia's personal bedmaid, until she no longer deems herself worthy of service, upon the word of the Aguellid.""

 zarantia.32.d:0 "Amani was used to traveling on the break of dawn with her son across perilous bridges and the jungles, to reach the nearest city that had a school, every day. She knew she wasn't the only one, for her path eventually mingled with many other parents and their children, who would be parted from their home and villages every day, to provide to their children at least the means to know when to write and read.\n\nBut, this Tuesday was fairly different, as she received the visit from a young-looking zebra, glasses on her face and a kind smile, as she spoke of her of the construction of a school on her humble village. How she didn't need to risk danger every day, just so her son wouldn't suffer the same shame she did every day she visited the bigger cities and had to ask help in understanding what was written on the streets and on paper.\n\nThat finally, the Aguellid were looking directly at zebras like her."

 zarantia.33.t:0 "The Weight of a Legacy" 
 zarantia.33.d:0 "Umalez has ever been curious, ever since she was a small foal running through the royal camp, giving her mother and father headaches to not end; while her mother would simply brush off or not answer any of her "fanciful flights", her father was more than happy to regale her, with tales and myths from Colthangian, from the ethereal beauty of Hypogriffia, the majestical ruins, and pyramids that dot Maregypt, and…lastly, to those distant, almost dreamy coast of Equestria.\n\nOf civilizations without parallel. Of lands with such a deep, prided history, one would wonder how her father, a simple teacher in his youth, could be so articulate with the world they live in\n\nOf course, that is not to say she didn't find awe in the tales of her mother. Of the myths of Mekiouzza, the uniter of tribes, the spirit of Zarantia. She who found a disparate, wayward Imazeeb and united it under her hoof, through words, deeds, and might. Her father and her mother butted heads frequently, but they still loved each other so much, it was said the Queen was the shining Sun upon Zarantia, but the King was the dome of the Celestial Realm, never outshining, but always holding her.\n\nKnowledge, and might. Legacy, and Inspiration. Such is the flux of knowledge within her school, as she inaugurated the Agzhat's National School, to the cheer and clopping of her subjects.\n\nAnd as chieftains and the rising "middle class" of the city spoke with her, her eyes couldn't leave the statue of her father, almost as if it was staring at her, and asking..."

A certain desire, even though she couldn't quite nail it, a nagging to the deep of her mind, like a thirst. It was right there, and she couldn't grasp it until she oversaw the shipments of hundreds upon hundreds of books towards the public libraries.\n\nIt has been days as she devoured dozens upon dozens of myriad books, ranging from fictional myths and legends, to reports and autobiographies, trying to find what elusive concept was haunting her so fervently, so intensely.\n\n"What is a Zarantian?"\n\nAn innocent enough question, but one she caught herself absently-minded asking herself as she returned her own borrowed books, the librarian tilting her head a bit, in confusion.\n\n"What do you mean, Princess Umalez?"What is a Zarantian, indeed? What are the people she's fated to rule over? That question highly depends on who she would ask, she wages. Her mother would say her subjects and leave at that, General Zawgha would say her charges...but they're all just that, titles to the people. What about culture? Myth, stories, tales, legacy?\n\nNone of the books she read were about them, not specifically. And that, that exactly is what she was searching for. But it doesn't exist on paper and recordings, no\n\nNot yet."

 zarantia.36.t:0 "All Zarantia shall live" 
 zarantia.36.d:0 "To be an Aguellid is to gaze upon the endless dunes of Zarantia, and see something in what many others see simply as an endless sea of sand. The night rose to the Sky, and she felt contemplative. Taking a temporary leave, and alleviating the worries of her aids she left her tent to take a long walk amidst the dunes of her home.\n\nThe howling of the wind, the biting cold, the starry sky, and the milky way stretched across her vision, reminding her how little time she truly had left. Her sun had set a long time ago, and she could do was to make sure the desert, its treasure, her people, and her daughter, endured the time the winds called to her yet again.\n\n"Mother, are you alright?"\n\nUmalez came running, a bit breathless. Such a teasing brat, yet it's moments like these her heart shone true…would she be okay? Would she be okay without her, eventually? She doesn't know…she likely never will. But that's alright.\n\nAs long as the Zarantia she leaves her with will pick up when she falters."

 zarantia.37.d:0 ""You can't do this to me, the Aguellid's law is not above our customs! Our traditions! These slaves are our-" Zagwa simply rolled her eyes, and in a single uppercut, knocked the teeth and the consciousness of the "Chieftain" of the tribe, to the horror and fear of the other "warriors". She didn't care much for the politics that happen between the tribe, her tribe casting her out in the desert for the crime of falling in love taught her a sharp lesson in trust not the whimsical, frail link between Imzabeeb, but between individuals, and bonds of kinhood.\n\nThat being said, that was one of the few decisions of the Aguellid she fully endorsed, and she all but insisted to see it to fruition. And as she stepped upon the fields of the tribe, and she saw the malnourished, weakly "spoils of war", she simply unsheathed her sword and trotted to each one with an unreadable expression.\n\nIt is depressing to think that as she approached, a tinge of fear came over them as if they were guilty of anything. She rose her saber high, and struck each and every one of their chains, their faces brightening as they were cast free.\n\n"You are a free zebra of your own accord. My brothers will take you towards the nearest town, and aid you in finding a true path to yourself."\n\nOf course, she knows it's not all in the goodness of her Aguellid's heart. The furnaces and factories need hooves to train, and the "economy" she so hears about needs people to buy, and be paid. But, in that particular instance, to the tearful smiles, hugs, and even oaths of following her Warband, she can't help but remark on how far that naive zebra cast to the desert went."

Pockets of resistance and reports of Guerrilla ambushes are still fairly common, she still has a nation to build before her daughter takes the Crown, and the threat of their neighbors is an ever subtle, insidious whisper in her ears; the path will be long, arduous, and she will certainly not live to see the end of it, whatever destiny it may take.\n\nBut, if those quick bright flashes are any indication, Zarantia may be starting to appear on the newspapers abroad it seems.

He wondered if any of them bothered to understand why he held so tightly to Tobuck, to the ideal of this fake, artificial state. The population despised them, their armies were as loyal as the coin was plentiful, and in truth, no single politician of the republic thought of their nation as anything more than a squeeze and dump investment.\n\nTruth is, he didn't know either.

Having travelled across northern zebrica for decades, he is a stallion of a thousand stories and a million insights. His return from his latest travels is eagerly awaited by not just Mekiouzza, but all imazeeb."

 ZAR_council_of_the_tribes:0 "The Council of Tribes"
 ZAR_council_of_the_tribes_desc:0 "Unlike the Colthaginian senate or the Maregyptian pharaoh, no imazeeb leader rules without the consent of the tribal leaders. Mekiouzza has not forgotten this, and she has invited them all for a grand meeting to hear them and to reaffirm their oaths to her."

 ZAR_chief_ironbreaker:0 "Chief Ironbreaker"
 ZAR_chief_ironbreaker_desc:0 "No tribe is as martially inclined as the Amsarmud, and no Amsarmud as able as Zawgha. On orders from Mekiouzza, she went to Colthage to gather all those imazeeb who served there as mercenaries and to curry favour among our old clients. Much imazeeb blood has been spilled for the zonicians. Hopefully they will honor this."

 ZAR_trans_zebharan_trade:0 "Trans-Zebharan Trade"
 ZAR_trans_zebharan_trade_desc:0 "The Storm King's rampage left the Trans-Zebharan trade devastated, and it is a shadow of what it once was. It will take years for it to grow back if it is not helped along. By royal decree, the caravans shall be restored greater than ever before."

 ZAR_messages_to_azir:0 "Assuaging the Azir Tribes"
 ZAR_messages_to_azir_desc:0 "The Azir tribes are a breed of their own, and the Imazeeb know well that if you wish to traverse their lands, you will respect them. Gifts of peace will help them overlook our trespasses, and extra precautions among the caravans will lower the risk of incidents."

 ZAR_muster_guards:0 "Muster Guards"
 ZAR_muster_guards_desc:0 "The Zebhara is a place of a thousand perils, from raiders to monsters, and the zebras who take on the duties of the caravans must be up to the task. Those who buy our services pay well for our protection, and we will not let them down."

 ZAR_a_grand_caravan:0 "A Grand Caravan"
 ZAR_a_grand_caravan_desc:0 "From Agzhat we will cut a path down to Camelkand, bypassing the Quaggatai lands and reaching the southeast in record time. This caravan is more than just a trading expedition, it is an affirmation that the imazeeb are still able and willing to master the Zebhara."

 ZAR_our_desert:0 "Our Desert"
 ZAR_our_desert_desc:0 "For centuries, the Imazeeb have not only survived but even thrived in lands that others find too harsh. Part of the key has been to never simply accept the desert for what it is. It can become more, and whether it will take decades or centuries, the imazeeb are patient."

 ZAR_a_hundred_tribes:0 "A Hundred Tribes"
 ZAR_a_hundred_tribes_desc:0 "Mekiouzza's greatest achievement is, and will always be, the fact that she created a measure of true unity among her people. Even after recent events this unity is weakened, but not broken, and it will be enough to ensure that when she is gone, her daughter is accepted by them."

 ZAR_rebuilding_and_recovering:0 "Rising up Once More"
 ZAR_rebuilding_and_recovering_desc:0 "The Storm King caused untold suffering among the imazeeb, yet they did what they always had and adapted. The greedy yeti chose to go after the wealthier cities instead of chasing them up and down the dunes. Though the dead never can come back, the material damage wrought can be repaired."

 ZAR_new_year_new_hope:0 "New Year, New Hope"
 ZAR_new_year_new_hope_desc:0 "Having done all she could, Mekiouzza has withdrawn from public life. A lifetime was given for her people, but now she will rest. The future awaits, but it will be her daughter's future."

 ###Army tree###

 ZAR_issue_of_war:0 "The Issue of War"
 ZAR_issue_of_war_desc:0 "Whilst the courage and skill of our irregular warriors is without question, we can double their effectiveness by developing a coherent doctrine. We must gather our commanders and make a decision as to what that might be."

 ZAR_the_desert_masters:0 "The Masters of the Desert"
 ZAR_the_desert_masters_desc:0 "We have decided to expand upon our traditional tactics, which largely consist of light, mobile units specialised in moving across open ground at speed and out-manoeuvring the enemy."

 ZAR_supply_caches:0 "Disseminating Supply Caches"
 ZAR_supply_caches_desc:0 "Every hunter or traveller worth their salt have known that a journey across the desert becomes infinitely easier if you made sure to set up supplies along the route the last time you travelled."  

 ZAR_listen_to_old_masters:0 "Listen to the Old Masters"
 ZAR_listen_to_old_masters_desc:0 "When queens and generals march, it is all too easy to forget the vast troves of knowledge that can be found among the old warriors. Those who fought when Mekiouzza was still young still remain, and they have much to teach still."

 ZAR_tribal_armories:0 "Tribal Gunsmithing"
 ZAR_tribal_armories_desc:0 "The best weapon in the world does not avail a warrior if it sits across the country. Instead of attempting to centralise our arms production, we should make sure that every town and every travelling group can produce their own weapons as needed."

 ZAR_history_guides_us:0 "History Guides Us"
 ZAR_history_guides_us_desc:0 "Are not tanks simply the chariots of Maregypt come again? Is not artillery the logical conclusion to the siege engines of Colthage? There is little that is new under the sun, and history can teach us how to move forward."

 ZAR_tribal_levy:0 "Calling the Tribal Levy"
 ZAR_tribal_levy_desc:0 "It would be wrong to expect our warriors to sit around for months on end, waiting for something to do. They have their own lives and their own families to care for. They will come when we call them, so there is no reason to worry."

 ZAR_warrior_pride:0 "A Warrior's Pride"
 ZAR_warrior_pride_desc:0 "Beyond duty and beyond honor, beyond all the reasons to fight, lies a pure and simple desire to not lose. To be Imazeeb is to persevere against all that the desert throws at you. To be a warrior, is to persevere no matter what your foe attempts."

 ZAR_born_to_endure:0 "Born to Endure"
 ZAR_born_to_endure_desc:0 "Through the freezing nights and the sweltering days, through endless sandstorms and days of nothing, anywhere and everywhere, we will push on towards victory. The soft coastal zebras call it insanity, but we know it as something we were born to do."

 ZAR_the_desert_demons:0 "The Desert Demons"
 ZAR_the_desert_demons_desc:0 "These raiders and assassins are unequalled, and they are willing to share their knowledge with us. The price is steep, but having them serve as our scouts will be a boon unlike any we could have hoped for."

 ZAR_learning_from_the_west:0 "Learning from the West"
 ZAR_learning_from_the_west_desc:0 "Our present mode of warfare is unsuited to contemporary combat. We must develop a modern army, under the tutelage of our western neighbours. Such a force would be much better able to hold ground."

 ZAR_to_fight_for_all:0 "To Fight for All"
 ZAR_to_fight_for_all_desc:0 "The defense of Zarantia takes precedence over all other concerns, be they mercenary work abroad, inter-tribal squabbles or any other thing. When the full might of the Imazeeb is levied thusly, it will be a force to be reckoned with."

 ZAR_courting_the_colthaginians:0 "Courting the Colthaginians"
 ZAR_courting_the_colthaginians_desc:0 "Our ties to Colthage are strong, and turning to them for greater insight into modern warfare is a natural. They've made use of our mercenaries for centuries, and we have many contacts among their generals. It is just a matter of asking."

 ZAR_fledgling_arms_industry:0 "A Fledgling Arms Industry"
 ZAR_fledgling_arms_industry_desc:0 "The modern wars will be fought with countless different tools, and we are lagging far behind. The arms industry of Tobuck is not available to us, so if we are to defend ourselves, we must build an industry of our own."

 ZAR_unified_principles_of_warfare:0 "The Unified Principles of Warfare"
 ZAR_unified_principles_of_warfare_desc:0 "Certain things are forever true when it comes to war, but the ways in which these things are expressed changes as time marches on. We must make sure to follow these changes, and be up to date with all the new methods of warfare."

 ZAR_cross_tribal_service:0 "Cross-Tribal Service"
 ZAR_cross_tribal_service_desc:0 "The Imazeeb must learn to fight for more than tribe or town. By spreading them out so that soldiers serve in other tribes, we reinforce the bonds between them, and lay the foundation for greater faith in Amsisi."

 ZAR_desert_tunnels:0 "Desert Tunnels"
 ZAR_desert_tunnels_desc:0 "It is a mad notion, but there is a precedent for it in the countless smuggler and escape tunnels dug not only around Tobuck but across Zarantia. If our enemy can strike from above, then we simply strike from below. A corps of assault engineers, specialising in tunnel assaults, can become our ace."

 ZAR_royal_chargers:0 "The Royal Chargers"
 ZAR_royal_chargers_desc:0 "Mekiouzza gathers the best around her, and the warriors are no exception. Those warriors hoof-picked by her will become a cadre of chargers unlike any that Zarantia has seen. They are the best of the best, the fiercest and bravest, they are the Royal Zarantian Chargers, and the ground quakes under their hooves."

 ZAR_arsenal_of_defense:0 "The Arsenal of Defense"
 ZAR_arsenal_of_defense_desc:0 "If Zarantia is to remain be safe, we must never stop continuing in our efforts to procure new weapons, nor can we ever presume that we are "done" with improving our military production capacity."


###Political Tree###

 ZAR_issue_of_unity:0 "The Issue of Unity"
 ZAR_issue_of_unity_desc:0 "The loss of Tobuck is more than the loss of a city, it is an existential threat to Zarantia itself. If a gaggle of warlords and gun runners can run us out of the city, then what will stop any outside force from crushing our fledgling state for good? We must come together, or we will fall."
 ZAR_i_am_mekiouzza:0 "I am Mekiouzza"
 ZAR_i_am_mekiouzza_desc:0 "I brought the tribes together. I led the war to free Tobuck from Warzena's clutches. I forged Zarantia as a concept, and I maintained it. It is mine by right, as none of the other tribal leaders could even come close to accomplish what I accomplished. Zarantia is mine, and I will drown it in blood before I allow it to fall."
 ZAR_bringing_the_tribes_together:0 "Bringing the Tribes Together"
 ZAR_bringing_the_tribes_together_desc:0 "Zarantia is - must be - one united force. The tribes can no longer claim independence from it, and they must be given their place in the order that now arises. Their place will be given willingly and generously, but they will take it, or else..."
 ZAR_enforce_the_amsisi:0 "Enforce the Amsisi"
 ZAR_enforce_the_amsisi_desc:0 "There are those who would not view those outside their tribe as kin, but as outsiders. They would show hospitality, but only as much as is needed, and they would make excuses when called to defend those who would come to their aid. There is a word for this: betrayal, and it is time to remind them of this."
 ZAR_remember_your_friends:0 "Remember Your Friends"
 ZAR_remember_your_friends_desc:0 "Some of our people have stood by the Aguellid's side since the beginning. They have shown more than just recognition of her ability and given her loyalty. Through thick and thin, they have stood by her side, and Mekiouzza has not forgotten this."
 ZAR_taking_their_oaths:0 "Demanding their Oaths"
 ZAR_taking_their_oaths_desc:0 "The time has come for the Aguellid's power to be based on more than honor and custom. Those who stand by her will swear oaths to serve her, no matter what order she gives. If they do not give it, they have no place under her."
 ZAR_reward_the_loyal:0 "Reward the Loyal"
 ZAR_reward_the_loyal_desc:0 "For the headstrong tribes of Zarantia, blind obedience is not a virtue, but a strange foreign notion. In order to ease their transit into the fold, there must be generous rewards for those who bow their heads to her."
 ZAR_we_unite_or_die:0 "We Unite or Die"
 ZAR_we_unite_or_die_desc:0 "The Imazeeb are weak. Once, we were strong, but this new age is not kind to our kind of people. Tobuck showed this, and desperate situations demand desperate measures. Options that once were abhorrent must be considered."
 ZAR_for_my_people:0 "For my People"
 ZAR_for_my_people_desc:0 "Mekiouzza's life has been one long struggle to bring the Imazeeb together, and to lead not just a tribe, but a people. Time and time again, the world has contested her, but time and time again she has pushed on. Calling on every favour she has, she will achieve her goals no matter the cost."
 ZAR_crush_those_who_would_divide_us:0 "Crush those who Would Divide Us"
 ZAR_crush_those_who_would_divide_us_desc:0 "Leaders object to Mekiouzza's plans, and tribes turn away from her. With their actions, they threaten to undo all that the Aguellid has accomplished. Generous gifts have failed, threats fallen on deaf ears.\n\nSo be it, either they die, or Zarantia dies."
 ZAR_they_blinked_first:0 "They Blinked First"
 ZAR_they_blinked_first_desc:0 "The savagery and speed with which Mekiouzza turned on her people has shocked the other tribes, and though many would willingly fight, it has been made clear that any tribe that turned against her would not find battle, but a slaughter. In blood and fire, Zarantia stays united."
 ZAR_a_true_queen:0 "A True Queen"
 ZAR_a_true_queen_desc:0 "Mekiouzza's place is carved into the annals of legend. For the first time, the Imazeeb are truly united. It happened in blood and death, but they now stand as one people. Queen Mekiouzza now leads her nation and her people forward to the future, for no other Imazeeb was worthy."

 ZAR_the_tribe_of_tribes:0 "The Tribe of Tribes"
 ZAR_the_tribe_of_tribes_desc:0 "The Imazeeb have always been a people of many tribes, but the question is whether that truly is a weakness. Certainly it precludes autocratic methods, but how many foreign thinkers have not written about the importance of checks and balances? We have that, always had it, and we simply need to refine it."
 ZAR_a_common_code:0 "A Common Code"
 ZAR_a_common_code_desc:0 "The tribes value their customs and traditions, and if unity is to be reached, these things must be respected. It will demand all the effort that we can muster, but the reward will be a Zarantia that the tribes feel invested in."
 ZAR_tribal_council_focus:0 "The Tribal Council"
 ZAR_tribal_council_focus_desc:0 "Mekiouzza has a long tradition of calling the tribal leaders to her to counsel her. Perhaps this institution should be made permanent, and give the tribal chiefs a formalised say in Zarantia's governance."
 ZAR_establish_high_courts:0 "Establishing High Courts"
 ZAR_establish_high_courts_desc:0 "Inter-tribal squabbles take up too much time and effort that would be better spent elsewhere. In order to relieve the burden this places on the government, we must create a pan-Zarantian justice system of neutral mediators that can speak with the Aguellid's authority."
 ZAR_the_code_of_rights:0 "The Code of Rights"
 ZAR_the_code_of_rights_desc:0 "There must never be any doubt in the minds of our people that we will respect their way of life. Our commitment to preserving the rights our people always have known shall be written into the very fabric of our nation, and if we fail in it then we will be held accountable."
 ZAR_selling_unity:0 "Selling Unity"
 ZAR_selling_unity_desc:0 ""Unity" is a strange ideal to most Imazeeb, and if we are to convince them to change their ways and embrace it, we must offer them a lot in return. If it succeeds, it will be the sale of the century, and Mekiouzza is no stranger to pulling off difficult sales." 
 ZAR_making_deals_and_promises:0 "Making Deals and Promises"
 ZAR_making_deals_and_promises_desc:0 "It will not be one great agreement that brings Zarantia together, but rather hundreds of small purchases and thousands of promises of aid or reward, arbitration, gifts and carefully chosen words."
 ZAR_pressure_the_unwilling_tribes:0 "Pressure the Unwilling Tribes"
 ZAR_pressure_the_unwilling_tribes_desc:0 "Not all tribes are open to unity, and some - like the Talat and their proud leader Wasif - fiercely defend their independence. Yet the Talat are poor, and where brute force might fail, a slow, steady squeeze might do better."
 ZAR_the_best_and_only_option:0 "The Best and Only Option"
 ZAR_the_best_and_only_option_desc:0 "Unity will bring peace and prosperity, it will ensure our people's continued existence and it will ennoble our people in the eyes of the rest of the world. It is a fantastic deal, and so it is understandable that we do not take no for an answer."
 ZAR_oaths_of_mutual_defense:0 "Oaths of Mutual Defense"
 ZAR_oaths_of_mutual_defense_desc:0 "If anything threatens one tribe, it threatens them all. This has always been the case, so formalising it is not an idea foreign to the tribes. Of all the changes that will come, it is probably the least controversial one, and it will let us mobilise much faster if needed."
 ZAR_a_chosen_council:0 "A Chosen Council"
 ZAR_a_chosen_council_desc:0 "As many tribal leader are unwilling to sit by Mekiouzza's side, and would rather attend their own affairs, Mekiouzza has suggested that instead they will choose representatives to fulfil this role. With these chosen representatives at her side, Mekiouzza's control is complete, even if not absolute."

###Industrial tree###

 ZAR_issue_of_land:0 "The Issue of Land"  
 ZAR_issue_of_land_desc:0 "It is from the land that our riches are gathered and grown, and from where the people stem. It is such a shame that the land is either held by absentee lords or lies fallow with no owner. To begin the path to modernity, this must be fixed."
 ZAR_our_own_tobuck:0 "Our Own Tobuck"
 ZAR_our_own_tobuck_desc:0 "Tobuck was a crutch to our nation's economy, and overreliance on it will not be a mistake we will repeat. Through investment, internal and external, we will carve a new jewel within our land."
 ZAR_settling_land_disputes:0 "Settling Land Disputes"
 ZAR_settling_land_disputes_desc:0 "One problem with land are the ancient disputes over who owns which land, or if it is owned in the first place. The traditional methods do not help inasmuch as it grinds down. Modern methods are needed to work these problems out."
 ZAR_colthaginian_and_maregyptian_advisors:0 "Colthaginian and Maregyptian Advisors"
 ZAR_colthaginian_and_maregyptian_advisors_desc:0 "Even if we do not have the know-how that we need to continue our march towards a modern society, other nations and their people have. Gold is a powerful motivator, and some can be swayed to apply the white heat of technology to Zarantia."
 ZAR_land_for_the_landless:0 "Land for the Landless"
 ZAR_land_for_the_landless_desc:0 "The final step of the land reform is to grant what land that is available to tenant farmers and those who do not stand to inherit land. A new land of smallholders and independent farmers, where it is not just a small class of lords that take all the profit."
 ZAR_find_the_desert_wealth:0 "Finding the Desert's Wealth"
 ZAR_find_the_desert_wealth_desc:0 "Where some see desolate wastes, we see opportunity. Riches beyond our dreams lie beneath the sands, and they are waiting for those worthy to use them as they see fit. We will find them, and we will use it for the betterment of Zarantia."
 ZAR_schooling_for_all:0 "Schooling for All"
 ZAR_schooling_for_all_desc:0 "Everything is founded on thoughts and brains. Though our generation may have been able to lift itselves up from our own disadvantages, we should not neglect the next generation. Everyone will need to receive an education. Tomorrow's battles will be on minds, not muscles."
 ZAR_hammers_to_break_chains:0 "Hammers to Break their Chains"
 ZAR_hammers_to_break_chains_desc:0 "Slavery is not only a weight to our economical potential, but a historical debt towards out people, for it has no place for a Zarantia that desires to grow. What only remains is to discuss how we will abolish this rot to our society."
 ZAR_the_trans_zarantian_road:0 "The Trans-Zarantian Road"
 ZAR_the_trans_zarantian_road_desc:0 "Everything needs a place to be. The hammer needs the nail, the fuel the engine. And roads are how it gets there. It is no good having the parts if they cannot come together. A road is sorely needed."
 ZAR_the_second_tobuck:0 "The Second Tobuck"
 ZAR_the_second_tobuck_desc:0 "Foreign investments, labor and trade flows through Agzhat's markets and factories like water, the rough diamond not only turned into a oasis, but as as one of the finest jewels of Mekiouzza's Crown. Our work to bring Zarantia to the modern age is far from over, but there's no shame in taking a moment to gaze upon our works."


 ZAR_rules_of_the_desert:0 "The Rules of the Desert"
 ZAR_rules_of_the_desert_desc:0 "The Imazeeb have lived among the sand and dunes for centuries through countless toils and hardships. Why should this time be any different? These traditions and customs have not steered the tribes wrong before and they will not this time. It must be ensured that these customs are enshrined in law to preserve and refine them."
 ZAR_tribe_support_laws:0 "Tribal Support Laws"
 ZAR_tribe_support_laws_desc:0 "The building block of Imazeeb society is the tribe. Before Zarantia and all else is the tribe. As such, laws will be enacting to ensure tribes can take care of themselves and take care of their own, even if it comes at the expense of the state as a whole."
 ZAR_division_of_labour:0 "The Division of Labour"
 ZAR_division_of_labour_desc:0 "While such a term like “division of labour” may seem out of place among the Imazeeb, it is not. All must do their part to ensure their community runs smoothly and all are provided for. By codifying existing traditions regarding labour, we can ensure small communities continue to operate smoothly."
 ZAR_everyzebras_right:0 "Everyzebra's Right"
 ZAR_everyzebras_right_desc:0 "All creatures yearn to be free, and zebras are no different. By putting zebras in chains, we violate that natural urge. On top of this, slave labour is proving inadequate for producing the complex machinery and tools used in modern methods. As such, slavery in its current form will be incrementally abolished and all slaves allowed to live (and more importantly work) as they please."
 ZAR_internal_trade:0 "Internal Trade"
 ZAR_internal_trade_desc:0 "While all the people may need is within our borders, it does not mean everyzebra can easily access them. By encouraging trade and caravans between villages and tribes, all will be able to benefit from our wealth and focus on the development of their own communities."
 ZAR_the_thousand_workshops:0 "The Thousand Workshops"
 ZAR_the_thousand_workshops_desc:0 "We do not need the massive, towering and dirty factories of the citydwellers. Cottage industry can be just as effective and every household is its own factory producing whatever the tribes, and therefore we, need be it swords, rifles, horseshoes, or silverware."
 ZAR_national_apprenticeships:0 "National Apprenticeships"
 ZAR_national_apprenticeships_desc:0 "Apprenticeships and masters teaching new tradezebras is a fairly common method of expanding skilled labor here and elsewhere in the world. We can upscale this process to the national level by establish state-backed apprenticeship schemas for those seeking trades as well as ensure all our tradezebras are up to a good standard."
 ZAR_duty_to_aid:0 "A Duty to Aid"
 ZAR_duty_to_aid_desc:0 "While we may not have the extensive handouts and welfare of our urban neighbours, we are not heartless. Everyzebra falls on hard times once in a while and it is the duty of everyzebra in the community to help lift them up. Likewise, we should show hospitality and generosity to strangers of our tribes. Let us turn no pony, zebra, or otherwise away if they are in need."
 ZAR_the_confederacy_stands_by_its_own:0 "The Confederacy Stands By Its Own"
 ZAR_the_confederacy_stands_by_its_own_desc:0 "While this may seem like a loose union, it is still a strong one within. In such a short time, the groundwork has been laid to ensure the Imazeeb tribes remain relevant and stronger than ever without abandoning our core values. With this alliance of tribes and families, we are sure to stand up to any challenge that may try to push into our homeland."

###Tobuck Conquest Tree###

 ZAR_issue_of_tobuck:0 "Drive out the Thieves"
 ZAR_issue_of_tobuck_desc:0 "The time has come to retake Tobuck. Pea Shooter might be gone, but his former allies still infest the city, and they have made it clear they will not surrender the city. So bet it then. Like we did fifty years ago, we will free Tobuck by force of arms and teach the thieves the price of crossing us."
 ZAR_tobuck_reclaimed:0 "Tobuck Reclaimed"
 ZAR_tobuck_reclaimed_desc:0 "In the end, the gun runners threats and boasts were nothing more than bluffs and empty banter, as once again, our armies march on Tobuck and reunite brothers and sisters. Small pockets of resistance are still being found, but for the time being, the Zarantia flag can pridefully flutter amongst Tobuck's skies!"
 ZAR_tobuckian_pledges:0 "Tobuckian Pledges"
 ZAR_tobuckian_pledges_desc:0 "While the population and the armies celebrate on the streets, our bureocrats wage another battle, not in weapon, but in pen and paper. Many communities within Tobuck still need to renew their pledges, and be integrated properly."
 ZAR_restoring_old_routes:0 "Restoring the Old Routes"
 ZAR_restoring_old_routes_desc:0 "Seems the Gun Runners last spiteful bark at us were blowing up the roads that connected to our cities. No matter, routes can be rebuilt and retraced, their pettyness mean nothing to us now that they're gone."
 ZAR_emerald_fields:0 "The Emerald Fields"
 ZAR_emerald_fields_desc:0 "The Tobuckian Sea is known by it's verdant, emerald gleam, but to it's countryside, true emerald fields lay. Now that Tobuck is finally reunited with us, it is a simple matter of fixing those factories, and re-establishing the emerald trade. While we can't get back the profit those thieves profitted from our bounty, we can however return from where we left off."
 ZAR_tobuckian_knowledge:0 "Tobuckian Knowledge"
 ZAR_tobuckian_knowledge_desc:0 "The swindlers and thieves left behind a vast wealth of knowledge after we drove them from our city. It would be folly to allow it to go to waste. As such, we must collect it up and replicate it so that we may instead bend the tools of the greedy for the good of all."
 ZAR_open_for_business:0 "Open for Business"
 ZAR_open_for_business_desc:0 "As the last pockets of resistance, and the last negotiations and pledges are made, the Tobuck Port is finally open for business! West, East or beyond, Zarantia welcomes all!"
 ZAR_taking_stock_of_the_city:0 "Taking Stock of the City"
 ZAR_taking_stock_of_the_city_desc:0 "The retaking of Tobuck was costly to both our warriors and the city itself. We must assemble an inspection team to sift through the rubble and debris to give us a clear view of the city's current problems and damage. Who knows, maybe they will stumble on something missed before?"
 ZAR_learning_from_change:0 "Learning from Change"
 ZAR_learning_from_change_desc:0 "With Tobuck finally back under our control, we can allow ourselves to look to the future. Never before our people have found themselves in such a position, holding what is truly a modern city. And even if the new task now before us is great, we have reasons to be hopeful. For Zarantia, a new chapter now opens."
 ZAR_offer_assurances:0 "Offer Assurances to the People"
 ZAR_offer_assurances_desc:0 "Though those that collaborated with our enemy deserve no pity nor mercy, we must not forget why we came here. Mekiouzza's name is still rembered after all this time, most of Tobuck's inhabitants having hoped for her return. Under our watch, the Tobuck will never suffer again."
 ZAR_pearl_of_the_green_bay:0 "The Pearl of the Green Bay"
 ZAR_pearl_of_the_green_bay_desc:0 "Tobuck suffered for a long time under the yoke of foreign adventurers who cared nothing for its people. Under Mekiouzza's leadership Tobuck shall be reforged into a mighty city, and a true capital of an united Zarantia."
 ZAR_hour_of_retribution:0 "The Hour of Retribution"
 ZAR_hour_of_retribution_desc:0 "Mercy has its place, but not when dealing with liars and backstabbers. Their words were worth nothing, and they have caused both us and our Tobuckian kin countless woes. For that, they will die, and their deaths will serve as a warning."
 ZAR_hunting_down_warlords:0 "Hunting them Down to the Last"
 ZAR_hunting_down_warlords_desc:0 "There is no escape for the scum who thought they could steal Tobuck from us. We will chase them to the edge of the world if we have to, and our vengeance will be terrible."
 ZAR_a_warning_to_the_world:0 "A Warning to the World"
 ZAR_a_warning_to_the_world_desc:0 "Years ago, we lost Tobuck to a band of bandits, thieves, mercenaries and cut-throats. As a flock of carrion birds they followed the Storm King there, believing they could prey on our lands undisturbed, that the Imazeeb tribes were too weak to oppose them. But now, the time has come; all shall learn the price for facing a united Zarantia!"
 ZAR_zarantia_stands_strong:0 "Zarantia Stands Strong"
 ZAR_zarantia_stands_strong_desc:0 "Tobuck's defences were damaged in the fighting, but also by a general lack of maintenance. Always the fools, the Gun Runners clearly were not interested in investing on their own safety. Now that we have returned, we shall rebuild the city's bastions and turn them into impregnable forts, ready to repel any invader."

 #####Oil Industry Tree#####

 ZAR_the_black_gold:0 "The Black Gold"
 ZAR_the_black_gold_desc:0 "Deep beneath our sands lies something more precious than gold, gems or even crystals. Oil; the life-blood of the new century. For Zarantia to prosper, we must tap the great deposits within our lands, so that they might fuel the machine of progress."
 ZAR_our_own_ability:0 "Our Own Ability"
 ZAR_our_own_ability_desc:0 "The tribes' ingenuity is the greatest asset at our disposal. After all, they have the know-how in digging deep wells, even if to uncover hidden water deposits rather than oil. There's no reason to doubt that they'll adapt to the new task quite easily."
 ZAR_foreign_assistance:0 "Foreign Assistance"
 ZAR_foreign_assistance_desc:0 "Many foreign nations have delved into oil extraction long before we did. It would be foolish for us not to learn from their methods, and their experts have surely much to teach us for the right price. Still, many wonder if depending to foreign expertise is truly a wise choice."
 ZAR_the_oil_fund:0 "The Oil Fund"
 ZAR_the_oil_fund_desc:0 "Oil brings wealth; wealth, however, is always accompanied by greed. The creation of specific institutions will help us prevent the concentration of wealth in the hooves of the few. Resources will be allocated to projects beneficial to all."
 ZAR_the_zamfara_wells:0 "The Zamfara Wells"
 ZAR_the_zamfara_wells_desc:0 "Our prospecting teams have discovered extensive oil deposits around Zamfara, deep beneath the ground. We'll be quickly dispatching construction crews and newly-bought equipment in the designated sites so that they may prepare the wells."
 ZAR_advanced_resource_extraction:0 "Advanced Resource Extraction"
 ZAR_advanced_resource_extraction_desc:0 "Our oil industry has come a long way. Primitive rigs and equipment are now being phased out for cutting-edge machinery; pumps work day and night to bring forth the black gold from beneath the shifting sands. Not a single drop will be wasted."
 ZAR_the_zajhari_wells:0 "The Zajhari Wells"
 ZAR_the_zajhari_wells_desc:0 "Our expedition from Zajhari has returned with excellent news; new deposits have been discovered in the area. Now, they may not be as extensive as others are, but they also are not too deep underground. This will undoubtedly make extraction easier for our crews."
 ZAR_new_methods_of_agriculture:0 "New Methods of Agriculture"
 ZAR_new_methods_of_agriculture_desc:0 "For a long time, our food production was held back by harsh environment and rudimentary techniques. This will no longer be the case; in exchange for our oil, foreign nations are ready to share with us not only their expertise, but tractors and industrial fertilizers as well. Our people will never go hungry again."
 ZAR_the_new_centurys_infrastructure:0 "The New Century's Infrastructure"
 ZAR_the_new_centurys_infrastructure_desc:0 "Long pipelines of steel now snake across our lands, delivering the precious black gold to newly-built plants in a constant flow. From there, barrel-loaded trucks travel across highways toward distant markets. Oil is the resource of the future, and therefore requires equally novel infrastructure."
 ZAR_the_tobuck_stock_exchange:0 "The Tobuck Stock Exchange"
 ZAR_the_tobuck_stock_exchange_desc:0 "Tobuck is no stranger to commerce and trade, but the great influx of wealth from the oil industry has brought it to all new heights. It's fame now spread all over the world, from Manehattan to De Vleugels, and the stocks rise accordingly."
 ZAR_the_desert_blossoms:0 "The Desert Blossoms"
 ZAR_the_desert_blossoms_desc:0 "It is done. Centuries of back-breaking work and sacrifices had led us to this, the moment our people dreamed and hoped for since time immemorial. Let us celebrate and feast now, for our titanic struggle against Nature itself is over. And Zarantia has won."
 ZAR_boomtimes:0 "Boomtimes"
 ZAR_boomtimes_desc:0 "Oil has brought great wealth to us, and we wisely spread it amongst the many rather than the few. Hospitals, schools, and infrastructures have been built, and our people can now enjoy exotic products from distant lands. Zarantia has changed and, thankfully, for the better."
 ZAR_wide_scale_prospecting:0 "Wide-Scale Prospecting"
 ZAR_wide_scale_prospecting_desc:0 "We can now expand our extraction operations to a degree never seen before. Thanks to the constant efforts of our tireless prospector teams, new deposits are been discovered each month. Not a stone will be left unturned."
 ZAR_modern_science_and_society:0 "Modern Science and Society"
 ZAR_modern_science_and_society_desc:0 "As more and more complex machinery are introduced, we can no longer depend on the experience of foreign experts. Curriculums must be revised and new specialised schools opened for eager young minds. There, Zarantia's future will truly take form."


 #### Leader Descriptions ####

 ZAR_mekiouzza_desc:0 "§YBorn§!:19th of February 941 in northern Zarantia.\n\n§YBiography§!: Mekiouzza was born as the oldest child of the leader of the Ataghan tribe, and her talent for leadership showed itself when the Tobuckian envoys came to seek aid from the imazeeb tribes. First to pledge herself to aid them, she managed to both convince her parents as well as many others to join the cause. What more, her zeal impressed the Tobuckians, and as the tribes moved to liberate the city from its Warzenan overlords, the Ataghan was able to set the agenda. And within the tribe, the agenda became set by young Mekiouzza.\n\nThe victory against Warzena raised the Ataghan to the apex of their power among the tribes, and Mekiouzza was raised to become their leader as well as the new Aguellid - the chosen leader with the right to call the tribes to war - in recognition of her triumphs. While not officially the leader of Tobuck, the city and its surroundings knew who they relied on for protection and therefore allowed her great say in their affairs too.\n\nEver since, Mekiouzza has worked to bring Tobuck and the imazeeb together into one, united nation akin to Colthage or Maregypt, and though the events of recent years have set her life's goal back by decades, she is nothing if not tenacious. \n\n§YPortrait By§!:Kajko and Venva"
