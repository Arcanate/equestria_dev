arcturian_torygg.1.t:0 "Call To Action"
arcturian_torygg.1.d:0 "Murmurs could be heard throughout the Council as the senior knights, scribes, and magesmiths of the Arcturian Order filtered into the Council Chamber. Headmaster Torygg had not informed them that there would be such a large audience for this week's meeting.\n\nThey didn't have to wait long before Torygg himself arrived, clad in ceremonial armor that he hadn't worn in ages. The esteemed Headmaster of the Order stood at the front of the room and rested a claw on the podium beside him. All eyes were on him as they could tell that this meeting would be more important than usual.\n\n"My dearest friends," said the old griff in a solemn tone, "Today marks the eleventh anniversary of the Luvenite Crusade that devastated our lands, and it also marks the second year since we began preparations to avenge those that we have lost."\n\nTorygg paused, taking a moment to close his eyes and breathe deeply. When he opened them again, a righteous fervor seemed to have replaced his gentle demeanor. "Which is why we must greatly expand our efforts to mobilize for a grand crusade of our own, the likes of which has not been seen in over a thousand years. To this end, I am exercising my power as Headmaster to issue a decree: There will be one more year to prepare ourselves, another to begin marching into the Dread Lands, and before the end of the third year we will take their dark fortress at the peninsula's end and finally be victorious."\n\nHe drew his sword and raised it into the air. "For the fallen! For Arcturius!""
arcturian_torygg.1.a:0 "For Arcturius!"

arcturian_torygg.2.t:0 "Reforging the Banners"
arcturian_torygg.2.d:0 ""It is no secret that the sword has fallen out of favor in the rest of the world. You of all griffons should know this, Ostwald."\n\nOstwald Vind raised an eyebrow at Torygg, "You sincerely believe that we should strive to replace our swords with muskets? To move away from a thousand years of tradition?"\n\n"Let me tell you a story," Torygg began, retrieving a battered old musket from his desk, "Many years ago, I lived in a faraway kingdom known as the Griffonian Empire. There was a revolution of sorts, and we had to take up arms against our brothers and sisters who had tried to storm the palace."\n\nTorygg eyed the rifle, wiping away some of the dust on it. "I didn't have a firearm. None of us did, the revolutionaries had seized almost all of them the day before. We were issued shortswords and told to defend the emperor with our lives." He paused, then looked directly into Ostwald's eyes. "I watched as my brothers and sisters were gunned down from afar as they tried in vain to charge towards the enemy. I was lucky to have found a working musket off of a corpse nearby. And because of that musket, I was able to survive that day."\n\nOstwald stood silently for a moment, then nodded. "It will be very difficult to replace every sword with a gun, you know. But you've convinced me how effective they can be.""
arcturian_torygg.2.a:0 "Now comes the hard part: Manufacturing them."

arcturian_torygg.3.t:0 "Modernization Program"
arcturian_torygg.3.d:0 ""Headmaster, if you've a moment, I'd like to run over a few things with you."\n\nTorygg looked up from his desk to see Hans Becker, a senior architect within the Order. He greeted him with a tired smile. "Yes, of course. What is it?"\n\n"It's about the modernization program that you proposed. A lot of the changes that you wanted to make are just... difficult to implement, but I think I may have found a way to get us started, at least."\n\nThere was a moment of silence. "Well?" said Torygg with a slow gesture, "Go on."\n\nHans appeared hesitant. He took a deep breath, then continued. "You remember the siege of Griffenheim in 978? The one we both fought in?"\n\n"Just because we once fought on opposing sides doesn't mean that I hold any ill will to you, Hans. Out with it."\n\n"Well, I had followed the Republicans into Cloudbury afterwards. In the years since then, the Griffonian Republic had managed to turn a primitive, mostly rural society into one that was, though admittedly not very stable, much more modern than it used to be. I recall some of the methods they had used, and I had some ideas on how to adapt them to our lands.""
arcturian_torygg.3.a:0 ""I sense that it won't be that simple, but I trust your judgement, Hans.""

arcturian_torygg.405.a:0 ""

arcturian_torygg.5.t:0 "Faith and the Fallen"
arcturian_torygg.5.d:0 "Torygg sat down next to an old birch tree in the stronghold's courtyard, feeling immense relief as he had finally managed to secure a few hours to himself. All of the recent speeches had begun to take a toll on the old griff. Torygg unbuckled his breastplate and removed his helmet, leaving them by the tree. Perhaps a visit to the Luvenite Memorial would help ease his mind.\n\nThe walk to the memorial grounds was quiet and uneventful, which was a blessing in and of itself. The stone road, though cracked and imperfect, reminded him of himself and the Order in a way. Everyone has their faults, but as long as they strive to fulfill their purpose, many shortcomings can be forgiven.\n\nThe memorial itself was as equally silent as he remembered. A few griffons here, a few ponies there, most were paying respects to the departed. A few were deep in prayer at the central statue emblazoned with the Sword of Arcturius. Curiously, all of those in prayer were ponies.\n\nTorygg never fully understood why the ponies of this land were such devoted worshippers of his gods. He'd long since given up trying to convince any of them that Arcturius, Boreas, and Eyr were actually just griffon gods. Perhaps it was better this way; the faith that the Order offered seemed to support them just fine in these trying times.\n\nSoon he stopped in front of a gravestone, one separated from the rest of the memorial. Here, the previous Headmaster of the Arcturian Order was laid to rest. It was unusual, as they had almost completely stopped burying their dead due to the wicked necromancers in the Dread Lands. But for this griffon... Torygg had wanted something traditional. He withdrew a pin from his tunic, one emblazoned with a simple shield of hope, then set it down next to the grave."
arcturian_torygg.5.a:0 "The time for shields has passed."

HLR_shield_of_hope_event_tt:0 "§YFor a shield is useless if it cannot save those that you have sworn to protect.§!"

arcturian_torygg.501.t:0 "You are Filled With Determination"
arcturian_torygg.501.d:0 "#TODO William makes a speech about the resolve of the Icewrought during the Luvenite Crusade. Exalting the bravery of their leader who kept spirits up during the siege of their clanhead's village"
arcturian_torygg.501.a:0 ""

arcturian_torygg.502.t:0 "To Seek Vengeance"
arcturian_torygg.502.d:0 "War preparations were in full swing in Fortress Boreas. All around the keep, knights of every caliber were moving materials, building tools, and taking stock of equipment. Above them, a young, female pegasus named Elfreda oversaw their actions from a balcony. Technically she should have been down there with them, as she was merely a knight-lieutenant, but she could sense that some of those below her weren't fully invested in the preparations.\n\nShe thought back to that terrible battle in her hometown eleven years ago where she had been rescued as a filly by Torygg's forces. Ostwald had pulled her from the dying embrace of her mother and slew dozens of undead to bring her to safety. She shuddered at the memory. Darkness had nearly swallowed her then.\n\nShe wouldn't allow such terrible things to ever happen again.\n\n"Brothers and sisters!" she suddenly shouted, "What do you fight for! Why are you here?!" Her commanding voice had an immediate effect, most of the others had stopped to look at the pegasus over the balcony. An ember began to burn inside of her. "The answer is clear: To make the monsters of the Dread Lands pay! The deaths of our loved ones are not something to be met with half-heartedness, but with fury! Our righteous wrath will cleanse our souls and burn every last vile abomination that faces us to ash! When we go beyond the safety of our walls, we will do so with the light of Arcturius shining through us! A light that can never be snuffed out!"\n\nShe raised her wings and ascended into the air, her heart filled with fiery reverence, "Arcturius watches over each of us! He will protect us, so long as we are faithful! We must always keep this knowledge with us, for it will grant us the strength to destroy the enemy!"\n\nDespite the suddenness of her speech, it seemed to have a profound effect on all who heard it. The knights redoubled their efforts and even began to chide those who weren't working hard enough."
arcturian_torygg.502.a:0 "Arcturius Protects..."

arcturian_torygg.6.t:0 "A Cleanup in Pondwatch"
arcturian_torygg.6.d:0 "Mathiaus Clawthorn flipped through the parchments detailing the monthly reports of the strongholds, towns, and outposts that compromised the Arcturian Order. Most of the time, these reports weren't that interesting to read. Recruitment numbers, births and deaths, territorial expansions, and so on. They'd started trying to keep track of everything ever since the Luvenite Crusade in 996 had nearly wiped them out.\n\nHe was ready to file away the parchments when something caught his eye. A report from the local garrison in Pondwatch. He picked it up and examined it: A vampire cell had been detected and neutralized, but the knights had suffered several casualties.\n\nMathiaus frowned. This was troubling. Vampire attacks had become more and more problematic lately, especially after Torygg had made his big speech about attacking the Dread Lands.\n\nThough he was pulling double duty as Priest and Scribe, Mathiaus knew that the Order could not rely on faith alone to halt these attacks. He would need to consult the Headmaster on what to do."

Swiftly they moved, silent their steps were, for their minds were focused on one thing: to find the rapacious Newborn and slay it. They knew they had to act quickly, as the Order likely wouldn't be able to respond for another week or so. Many innocent lives would be ended by then.\n\nThe Hunters stopped in front of a distraught-looking house as Greth, the most senior among them, held up a claw to his companions. He briefly raised his mask to sniff the air, then nodded. "The Newborn is here. I shall act as bait, take up positions to cover me." Immediately the others dispersed to obtain vantage points and flanking positions.\n\nGreth composed himself and knocked at the door. "Hello? I apologize for the intrusion, but I am quite weary, may I rest here for the night?"\n\nAfter a few moments of silence, the door opened, revealing a trembling stallion trying to cover his face. Fangs were clearly visible despite his efforts. "S-Sorry, I-I cannot let you-"\n\nGreth didn't waste any time, immediately drawing his dagger and thrusting it into the stallion's throat. The stallion dropped his foreleg, revealing his crimson eyes, then collapsed to the ground, unmoving. Greth pushed the door fully open, only to see nearly a dozen bodies drained of blood scattered around the front room. He whistled, signalling to his companions that it was all clear.

#Old Man Torygg fucking dies part 1
arcturian_toryggdeath.1.t:0 "Early To Rise"
arcturian_toryggdeath.1.d:0 "With a heavy groan, Torygg Brightclaw lifted himself from his bed. Despite being relatively fit for his age, the role of Headmaster had finally begun to take its toll on Torygg’s body. Gone were the days where he bested most other knights in terms of strength and agility. Although he loathed to admit it, Torygg believed that soon he might not be able to lead any more expeditions into the Dread Peninsula.\n\nStill, for the time being he could manage himself. He had to set an example for the young trainees, after all. Torygg glanced out of the window, seeing that the sun had yet to rise. He’d arisen a bit earlier than usual, but soon the rest of Fortress Boreas would awaken and begin their routines. The rugged Headmaster dressed himself in his usual garb, a soft grey and gold tunic with a rusted medal attached to it. He glanced at it briefly, reminiscing on the brief time he’d served in the Royal Army of Griffenheim, long before he’d made the pilgrimage to join the fabled Knights of the Arcturian Order. It seemed like a lifetime ago.\n\nTorygg allowed himself a moment’s respite before he began his day. He’d been trying to organize the workforce of the Order to begin constructing a basic road to the Whitetail Mountains in the south, but progress had been slow. Logistics was a surprisingly difficult thing for an old military griff to manage, so he’d enlisted the help of Julius Veck, one of the brightest minds within the Order.\n\nSpeaking of... Torygg opened the door and left his quarters. He had needed to discuss some additional details with Julius, so he made his way to the younger griffon’s room, which was tucked away in a corner far across the fortress.\n\nAs he reached the room, Torygg could have sworn that he heard a female voice behind the door. He chuckled slightly, letting his imagination play guessing games. It was still early in the morning, and he didn’t want to walk in on Julius while he was busy with somegriff… or somepony. “I’ll just come back later,” mused Torygg to himself. He was about to leave when he heard Julius say something alarming.\n\n“...they suspect nothing, Master. I will personally see to it that…”\n\nTorygg’s blood ran cold. Was Julius compromised? Was he enthralled? Torygg turned back, gripped the door handle, then shoved it open. Before him stood the young Julius and a sultry, well-dressed unicorn. Their heads flicked towards Torygg, and there was a brief silence. Alarm bells began ringing in Torygg’s head as he noticed the mare’s crimson irises."
arcturian_toryggdeath.1.a:0 "A vampire!"

#Old Man Torygg fucking dies part 2
arcturian_toryggdeath.2.t:0 "Early Demise"
arcturian_toryggdeath.2.d:0 "Thoughts raced through Torygg’s mind as he established the scene in front of him. Julius was enthralled by a vampire. The vampire in question was inside Fortress Boreas. That meant that it was possible that other knights, possibly even council members within the Order were thralls serving unholy masters. Their sanctuary was no longer safe. He’d been dealing with thralls in low-level positions for ages, but to see one holding a notable rank within the Order… this was bad. Very bad.\n\nTorygg instinctively reached towards his scabbard, then realized that he’d neglected to put it on since he had only expected a casual conversation. He could tell that they both knew this, too. The mare smiled, revealing a set of fangs that glistened in the candlelight. Julius simply stared at him with a blank expression.\n\nThe vampire took a step forward. She spoke with a tender voice, “Stay a while, won’t you?”\n\n“If it’s all the same, I’d rather not.” Torygg really didn’t want to give them an opportunity to escape, but he was ill-equipped to fight them. He methodically reached for the door, preparing to slam it behind him once he actually fled.\n\nWithout taking her eyes off of him, the vampire spoke again, but her voice carried an unnerving tone, as if it were layered over itself multiple times. “Don’t let him escape.”\n\nJulius immediately charged towards Torygg, but was met with solid wood as Torygg quickly stepped back and positioned himself behind the partially-opened door. Torygg then tried to fully close it to buy him some time, but the younger griffon’s claw gripped the bottom rail with an unnatural strength. Torygg grunted as he pulled with all his might, but the enthralled griffon had evidently received some of his master’s vitality. He decided to abandon this strategy and simply flee while calling for help.\n\n“ALARM! ALARM!” shouted Torygg as he ran away from the room. He heard the wood burst into splinters behind him, and before he could turn to see how close his pursuer was, it was too late. Two claws gripped Torygg’s hind legs and he fell to the ground, knocking the wind out of him. Those claws then wrapped themselves around Torygg’s neck and began to choke him from behind. He grabbed the claws and tried to pry them away, but to no avail. His vision began to blur, and as soon as his strength began to waver, Julius shifted his grip from the neck up to Torygg’s head. There was a twist, causing a sickening crack to echo throughout the hall.\n\nThe elder griffon unceremoniously collapsed to the ground. Torygg Brightclaw, Headmaster of the Arcturian Order, had died."
arcturian_toryggdeath.2.a:0 "The end of an era."

#Oh god of fuck what do we do
arcturian_toryggdeath.3.t:0 "Chaos within the Order"
arcturian_toryggdeath.3.d:0 ""To say that Fortress Boreas was in turmoil would be an understatement. The Headmaster, dead? Murdered in the sanctity of our holy stronghold? By the claw of one of our own? Soon after hearing a call for alarm, guards had found a griffon standing overtop Torygg’s body with an empty look in his eyes. They had apprehended and vigorously questioned him. Soon they determined that the young griffon had not been acting of his free will, and was forced to do it by one of the most despicable creatures to inhabit the cursed Dread Peninsula: a vampire.\n\nA vampire was responsible for Torygg’s death. To make matters worse, it could still be loose inside of the castle. Every able-bodied knight was summoned, even some who were retired or still in training. Within the hour, the entire fortress and its surrounding areas were being torn apart as they looked for wherever the creature might be hiding.\n\nThe Grand Council stood by their chairs in the war room as patrols passed by them. There was a grim atmosphere as they confirmed what little information they knew. Their Headmaster was dead, and the creature responsible was nowhere to be found.\n\n"We should hold a funeral, at the very least," said their youngest member, a griffon by the name of William Steelbeak, "We should be glad they didn’t make off with his body."\n\nA senior member of the council, Østwald Vind, shook his head at this suggestion, "We should not be glad at all, William. What we previously thought to be an impenetrable stronghold has proven to no longer be the case. Our lax security within this fortress has led to the death of our beloved Headmaster. Yes, a funeral is in order, but we have more pressing matters to take care of right now..."
