ERI_enforce_levy:0 "Serve Your Duke"
ERI_enforce_levy_desc:0 "Slugs! Worms! The time has come again to throw our great might against that perpetual thorn in my side, Iovinus. As per their obligations, the peasants must be rallied to the cause, armed and equipped to the fullest. They shall support our knights in a glorious charge, and there better be no talk about rights again."
ERI_emergency_conversion:0 "Emergency Production Expansion"
ERI_emergency_conversion_desc:0 "Firearms! Ordnance! Shovels! The soldiers of House Erie always require more equipment for the war effort. Several non-vital production centres will have to be forcibly converted to fulfill these requests, and the Duke will tolerate no delays in the matter."
ERI_up_the_taxes:0 "Increase Noble Obligations"
ERI_up_the_taxes_desc:0 "The Duke isn't one for two-faced behaviour, which is why the nobles sworn to his banner should contribute further for his future great victory. Increased taxes, length of field service and required griffonpower drawn from their ranks are required if we are to claim Verenia in the Duke's name."
ERI_fund_fabrice:0 "Invest In Research"
ERI_fund_fabrice_desc:0 "Fabrice Assaultine, the Duke's Grand Inventor, is a griffon of brilliant thoughts, and he has provided us a great plenty in new technologies and reverse-engineered foreign designs. Surely, we should invest a portion of our yearly income to his private business, so that we may further benefit from his breakthroughs?"
ERI_fund_livio:0 "Expand Information Network"
ERI_fund_livio_desc:0 "Livio Sillègue, although despised by many for his deceptive methods, has been invaluable in unconvering numerous plots from House Eyrie. If it weren't for his eyes and ears, we wouldn't have been prepared for numerous feints and ambushes. If his activities received more coin, then we could count on clearer information in the future."
ERI_mobilise_economy:0 "Necessary Sacrifices"
ERI_mobilise_economy_desc:0 "Nogriff is pleased to do it, but the honest truth is that we must be more conservative with our already limited resources. As much as possible should be diverted towards supporting the war effort, with the knowledge of our complete control of Verenia being our guiding light and motivation for enduring this hardship. One day, it will all be worth it."
ERI_noble_oaths:0 "Rally The Bannergriffs"
ERI_noble_oaths_desc:0 "The Midnight Banner does not stand on its own: the Duke's most loyal followers come from the lesser noble houses, such as the Bonbolet, De Laframboise, Des Groseilles, Du Poivrier and others. Following feudal obligations, they must contribute their household knights in the next assault against House Eyrie, and the Duke will fulfill his side of the arrangement, as agreed."
ERI_approve_plan:0 "The Knight-Commander's Course Of Action"
ERI_approve_plan_desc:0 "We haven't fought a war for decades without learning anything. The Duke's esteemed brother, Cyrille, Comté d'Pont-aux-Griffes, has been working hard in working out a viable strategy that will allow us to break through the notoriously entrenched riverbank. There are no large scale fortifications owing to a lack of resources, yet the land is intensely difficult to advance through."
ERI_die_iovinus:0 "To End My Sibling"
ERI_die_iovinus_desc:0 "The time is now! This is our moment of triumph! We shall march across the river and put an end to Iovinus' feeble schemes. Onwards to victory and glory, for the Duke! For Verenia!"

#### DECISIONS & DECISION CATEGORIES

ERI_the_conflict:0 "The Succession of Verenia"
ERI_the_conflict_desc:0 "For almost three decades, the proud and haughty patriarch of House Erie, Vincent, has led a campaign of brutal warfare in an effort to claim the entirety of Verenia for himself, and teach that insolent whelp Iovinus a lesson in respect. The roots of this stalemate can be traced to the bloody revolution of 978, which led to the deaths of many prominent nobles and dignitaries, leaving only two candidates with the lawful claim to the Verenian legacy. With no major power willing to intervene on his behalf, and the unexpected secession of his northern lands under the leadership of Lady Avian, the self-styled Duke of Erie must rely on his own martial strength and no small amount of guile if he is to succeed. Assisting him in this regard are his most trusted advisors, who nonetheless bicker with each other for the Duke's influence, the lesser noble families who serve more out of obligation and promises of expanded holdings than loyalty, all while a tired class of peasants and middle class city dwellers wish for peace. Should the impoverished griffons be pushed to the limit with taxation and conscription, a §Rrevolution§! seems likely to occur. \n\nThe §WKnight-Commander§! is currently §Yacknowledged§! by the Duke.\nThe §CGrand Inventor§! is currently §Gappreciated§! by the Duke.\nThe §gDucal Spymaster§! is currently §Rdisrespected§! by the Duke.\n\nThe §ONobility of Erie§! are currently §Ysatisfied§! with the Duke.\nThe dissatisfaction of §Llower classes§! is currently §Rworrysome§!."

#### IDEAS & ADVISORS & DESIGN COMPANIES

E_E_rivalry_erie:0 "War Of Two Houses"
E_E_rivalry_erie_desc:0 "§RTwo households, both alike in dignity,\nFrom ancient grudge break to new mutiny,\nWhere civil blood makes civil claws unclean.§!\n§W--------------§!\nThe bitter feud between the rival houses of Eyrie and Erie - both houses as irreconcilable to each other as the Sun and Moon, Day and Night - has led to decades of incessant internecine violence between the two heavily militarised houses. Both leaders of the houses claim to be the rightful and legitimate Dukes of Verenia, and both of them refuse to negotiate with each other. The violence will likely continue until one side proves triumphant."
hardcore_feudalism:0 "Entrenched Feudal Relations"
hardcore_feudalism_desc:0 "Even as revolutions and change swept across Griffonia, the rulers of Verenia have been extremely reactionary in clamping down on the evils of republicanism and democracy. Technological progress is encouraged solely on the condition that it does not interfere with the established social order, leading to the region being perceived as backwards compared to their neighbours."
not_our_war:0 "Clamour For Peace"
not_our_war_desc:0 "The war for Verenia has dragged on for a seemingly indefinite amount of time, even after many conflicts in surrounding regions ceased. As a result, the growing middle class and the landed peasantry are extremely hesitant to fight in the service of what they perceive to be an uncaring ruler, wishing nothing more than a return to normalcy and peace. Replenishment and recruitment of new regiments is quite difficult as a result, and the only reliable units are ones on the Duke's personal paycheck."

ERI_knight_commander:0 "Absolon Cyrille d'Amphitre"
ERI_knight_commander_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 30th of April, 959 in Calembourg\n§YRank§!: Paladin-Commandant de la Maison Erie\n\n§YBiography§!: Fondly known among his fellow peers and common soldiers as the "hero of many battles", Cyrille is the younger brother to the duc d'Erie, widely regarded as a paragon of chivalry and gallantry. It is noted that without his brilliant tactical leadership, House Erie would have long perished, and it is thanks to Cyrille, the cities of Pont-aux-Griffes and Erie resisted three sieges over the course of ten years. The tale many recount at dinners and outings is one at the second siege of Pont-aux-Griffes, where the Comté held the bridge with a small group of knights against a vastly superior Eyrian force.\n\nIn spite of his almost legendary exploits, Cyrille remains unclouded from delusions of grandeur. His sole commitment remains the furthering the cause of his liege lord, distancing himself from the politicking and schemes in the ducal court. When it comes to management and paperwork, Cyrille usually delegates the responsibility, preferring to concentrate on his training and family. Regardless of his immense propaganda value, the Comté continues charging headlong into the next battle, leading the troops under his command wondering if he has a suppressed death wish, or simply vicious bloodthirsty tendencies.\n\nThus, the Comté d'Pont-aux-Griffes remains an instrumental griffon for the continued success of House Erie.\n\n"

ERI_grand_inventor:0 "Fabrice Assaultine"
ERI_grand_inventor_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 10th of July, 965 in Bruma\n§YOccupation§!: Grand Inventeur\n\n§YBiography§!: The fourth child of an average Herzlander family, Fabrice Assaultine was quick to learn from the world around him. Tinkering with machines and tools, his adept claws made many improvements to existing designs, and his natural brilliance eventually earned him a place at the most distinguished universities of Yale. Prodigal genius did not result in having aptitude in social niceties, and he ended up expelled twice, for publicly humiliating the university rector in a competition and creating unusual machinery that had many swear they were powered by unholy energies.\nUnbothered by ostracisation, Fabrice was quick to adapt and taught himself everything he wanted and needed to know, travelling far and wide in search of a wealthy patron to support his many indulgences. Self-described as a scientist in every discipline, he did not stay anywhere for too long, even as many yearned for his superior inventions, such as the efficient internal combustion engine, or automata that functioned without magical aid. When his travels led him to Verenia, he found steady employment as the Duke's personal advisor and innovator, opening several workshops dedicated to science.\nFabrice's arrogance has not receded in the slightest, and many in the Duke's court despise him for his contemptuous attitude and lowborn origins. He dismisses their short sighted criticisms, and spends most of his days creating the weapon that will tip the war in the Duke's favour, as well as many nights spent drinking and gambling with his employer.\n\n"

#### LEADER DESCRIPTIONS

duke_erie_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 25th of September, 954 in Calembourg\n\n§YBiography§!: As the wealth and splendour of Verenian dukes grew, so too did the size of their family. The children and siblings of the ruling duke would vie for favour, seeking to inherit the largest share of the estates, for under the old style of griffon inheritance, those not in the direct line of succession would receive a pittance, not enough to sustain a comfortable lifestyle as expected of peers. Thus it led to the creation of the cadet branch of noble house Erie, which would sustain the excess members of the senior line from house Eyrie. This arrangement was a mostly satisfying one, at least until the revolution of 978.\n\nThe most senior member of house Erie left after the Republicans butchered most of his family, Vincent seemingly embodies the traditional noble qualities which led to such dissatisfaction: arrogance, hedonism and scant concern for his servants. This is not helped further by the fact that he has rebelled against the established order of succession, which states that house Eyrie has priority for the Verenian throne. But those close to Vincent would confirm his eloquence and learned mind, exceptional generosity to griffons who have served him well, and above all, an unshakeable desire to see Verenia flourish like in the times of old. Some even say that he can be very charming when it suits him, though Vincent has yet to secure marriage even after he passed 50 years of age. What is beyond certain, however, is that the self-styled Duc d'Erie would sooner die than leave Verenia in the claws of his loathed half-sibling.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

#### EVENTS

erie.1.t:0 "An Introduction To A Sordid Tale"
erie.1.d:0 "My name is Vincent, the true duke of Verenia. For decades, I've waged a war of unmatched ferocity and fervour over these lands against my accursed half-brother, Iovinus, the false duke. In the past, our ancestors have ruled Verenia and its lush plains, lucrative river trade routes and splendid cities, whose grandeur only increased after we swore fealty to the rising Groverian Empire. However, everything changed after those filthy, uppity revolutionaries tore through the region, and left most of my family hanging on trees, including poor father. With the line of succession unclear, and my vacuous brother unwilling to submit, there was no choice but to fight for the title.\n\nAlas, victory was within my grasp, if it weren't for that trollop Katrina, who absconded with a sizeable portion of my property and soldiers. The endless stalemate developed, and Verenia fell behind in terms of development and population. Indeed, I've even heard that in distant corners of Griffonia, they make jokes of two dunderhead dukes fighting over worthless rocks. To this I say, nay! They do not realise the beauty of this land, which I dearly love with all my heart. I'd love nothing more to see it restored to what it once was, even if in the end I'm forced to submit to some other rising tyrant.\n\nFortunately, my few and faithful retainers (the same cannot be said about the worthless peasants who keep complaining) work tirelessly in achieving the noble goal. Alongside the noble families who are sworn to the Erian Midnight Banner, the most notable griffons in this House are my biological younger brother Cyrille (who in spite of his stuffy attitude, he is a very brave and capable commander), a brilliant mind named Fabrice (provides me with new inventions and drinking company on weekends) and Livio, the court rat (his schemes have not always produced the required information, but he is too valuable to dispose of).\nThese are my capabilities, and I shall stop at nothing to achieve my rightful claim to the throne."

erie.3.t:0 "Yet Another Setback" #forced white peace event
erie.3.d:0 "This was going to be the day. This was it! The culmination of his efforts and desires! Vincent d'Erie would have his vengeance, and all of Verenia would finally be his. Confidently strutting in his workstudy, the only thing left to do was await the arrival of an herald proclaiming victory.\n\nAnd not a moment too soon, there was already a knock on the door, followed by a frightened-looking messenger carrying multiple envelopes. "Ah, servant! Has the battle gone well? Is that cur Iovinus finally in a cage where he belongs? Give me the news now!" Alas, the retainer was too cowed by his superior leadership skills and could only meekly deliver his missives. Wasting little time, the Duc tore off seals from letters and began reading.\n\n"Peasant revolts... front broken... full retreat ordered..."\n\nThe shocking turnabout was too much for the Duc to handle, furiously throwing the papers into the fireplace, followed by slamming his claws on his prized mahogany table. This could not stand. He has waged an epic campaign of warfare and leisure, and his idiotic, pathetic excuse of a brother refused to give in! There could be no more half-measures. Remembering that the peasant griffon was still sharing his quarters, he issued a quick and imposing bark, as befitting a griffon of his stature and authority:\n\n"Servant! Bring everygriff who matters to these chambers, now."\n"W-which ones, my liege?"\nOh how the Duc hated incompetence. "Every. Single. One. The Knight-Commander, the Spymaster, the Grand Inventor, the leaders in the field who aren't dead or dying, anygriff who does something in the court! Now get moving before I cut your wages!"\nSatisfied that his unquestionable authority sent the lowly servant to a dart, Vincent moved to his comfortable resting chair to formulate the next course of action. And of course, the scoldings he would give to his underlings."
erie.3.a:0 "Can't anygriff do anything right?!"

erie.4.t:0 "The Faults In Our Actions"
erie.4.d:0 "As the horrid day shifted to a mercurial evening, the Duc's quarters slowly became filled with griffs of various stature and state of well-being. There stood Cyrille, huddled with his subordinates Keu, Dugrain, d'Étang and others Vincent cared not to remember at the moment. Some were clutching bloody wounds, but not his sibling alright, oh no, getting injured was an affront to a valiant knight. Or perhaps he simply hid it very well under his armour. Fabrice and Livio occupied one of the minor tables, with the ducal egghead holding several papers in front of a rather bored looking spymaster. Must have been another one of those witty poems. Meanwhile, a few members of the lesser noble families mingled amongst themselves, looking rather clueless to the point of this meeting, but did it matter? Vincent decided enough had gathered for a proper rebuke by his indomitable authority.\n\n"Well, everygriff? What is the meaning of this? All of you have assured me that we were prepared, that this time for sure, House Eyrie would be trampled under our assault. Yet, we are undone because of what, a few peasant riots? I hope there's a very good explanation for this."\nJust like that, murmurs and whispers ceased, replaced with an uncomfortable silence, only interrupted by the ticking of an imported Skyfall clock. It would have gone on like this for a long time, if the bold knight didn't step in to the fray, as he usually did.\n\n"My liege, please, do not blame your brave soldiers. We all fought gloriously, spurred on by a righteous cause, but we were undermined by circumstances not within our control. Namely, the rat Livio provided us with faulty information! Pluck his feathers and flog him!"\nAmusing how the supposed icon of chivalry didn't see himself above passing the guilt, and with that, the cacophony was released.\n"My fault? It's not my fault your featherbrain can't read simple reports! Maybe you should slam your head on the wall less!"\n"House Bonbolet was always your favourite, my lord! Please forgive us!"\n"I say we teach the peasants a lesson! Torch their houses and fields!"\n"Does anygriff have spare bandages?! I beg you, Lothaire got shot in the wing!"\n"Fools! While you argue like ponies, Iovinus only gains! It won't be long before he burns down Château Erie!"\n\nSpoiled, insipid children. Vincent had to act before it came to blows and scrapes. With a mighty bellow that silenced the lesser underlings, he would spread his claws over the elegant table and cowed them all into submission.\n"I do not care whose fault is it, because it's clear and obvious, all of you have failed in some manner, costing House Erie precious resources, which we do not possess. You will return to your posts, fix your egregious mistakes, and then we can do this properly. By Eyr, we've been stuck at this for over 30 years, you think we would have learned something already. Now...""
erie.4.a:0 "Out! All of you, begone!"

erie.5.t:0 "Workshop Of Wonders"
erie.5.d:0 "The sting of failure still lingered in Vincent's mind, but it was best not to dwell on it for too long. After all, he spent the previous two days indulging in the contents of his wine cellar, where a particular Francistrian vintage caught his attention. Now, the time is right to get back to work, and pay a visit to his most trusted servants. Taking a more personal claw in the matter will ensure nothing's left to chance next time.\n\nMilling through the streets of Erie (the Duke had a little internal giggle each time he reminded himself of the city's egotistic naming), Vincent would make his way to the local branch of Ateliers Avault. No doubt, Fabrice was well on his way towards discovering an ingenious weapon that would smite Iovinus to scorching pieces! Or more likely, nursing a hangover from last night.\n\nWhat he didn't expect, as he entered into the workshop's main hall, was an arc of lightning striking not even an arm's length away from him! Vincent briefly felt his life instantly passing over his eyes, with a scattered prayer to Eyr, until his stupor was interrupted by the familiar smooth voice, slowly gaining in closeness.\n\n"Apologies, mon Duc! What you've just witnessed is my latest and greatest creation! It came onto me in a dream, no doubt granted by Boreas Himself! Still a work in progress, though..."\n"Aaaaaaah... Fabrice! What have I told you about safety measures? I could have been seriously hurt!"\nIf the brilliant inventor seemed phased, he didn't quite show it. "Nonsense, friend! I'm not much for medical science, but I'm sure I would have been able to treat any... non-serious wounds. That's the best I could promise. Now then, what is the purpose of my Duke's visit to this humble shrine of science? It's far too early for leisure, is it not?"\nOh yes, Vincent would have loved some casual games accompanied by imported Skyfall whiskey and cigars. But later on that, this time he meant business. "Not now, Fabrice, but I do have something most excellent to show you for that time. I'm here to discuss our immediate plans for House Erie and how your work should fit into it. May we speak in privately?"\nInstructing his workers to take care of the machinery, the loyal servant would guide his employer through the maze-like hallways. "I was certain we would triumph this time, but fortune did not favour us. I've been working on something to even the odds, but we need more of your generous investments...""
erie.5.a:0 "Your clever mind has rarely failed to deliver, dear friend."

erie.6.a:0 "Perhaps you should focus more on your job, rather than blaming others?"

erie.7.t:0 "The Eternal Frontier"
erie.7.d:0 "Dealing with Livio's curmudgeonly attitude was always something that deserved a drink or two, but Vincent had to press on with his responsibilities. Learning from the château's castellan that his esteemed sibling was touring the riverside, he would set out to join him, taking no personal guard alongside him, to not attract any attention of course.\n\nIt was both a blessing from Boreas and a curse from Maar that the great river flowed so closely from his holdings, though the location itself had few good things to say about it. Dreary and wearisome, holes dotted the blasted countryside intermixed with snaking trenches and small scale bunkers. Even the sky itself was clouded in a melancholic grey, the only colours of life he could spot were fallen pennants and banners, still clinging to those who carried them. How many met their demise here? The living few seemed like shadows, collecting lifeless husks of griffons for burial and equipment retrieval, but Vincent paid them no heed as he climbed an imposing hill.\n\nAs expected, Cyrille occupied this strategic redoubt, his precious honour guard watching the perimeter. Clad in gleaming panoply and armed with various polearms, their purpose seemed only to look imposing and harken to a bygone time. Brushing past the watching statues, Vincent would join his brother, both peering across the gloomy waters.\n"Dear Cyrille, why would you return to this horrid frontline? I feel that a prolonged time here could choke a griff in sorrow."\n"Our duty compels us to never falter, Vincent. I hold little love for the battlefield—", his bloodstained tabard suggested otherwise, "—yet I know one day, we'll restore life to fair Verenia, the war but a distant memory of a frigid Winter. I have faith in the strength of Erian knights, and all who march with us to death and glory. Speaking of which, I am here to oversee the marshalling of our defences, and give proper respects to the fine griffons who gave their lives." He would then lean on his cruel looking halberd.\n"That is all fine and well, Cyrille, but I need you back at the château within the week. I trust you'll conclude your business in a timely manner?" Vincent wanted nothing more right now than the comfort of his fireplace.\n"Oh, of course. Do watch your head when you leave, my scouts spotted some forces milling at the other side. Wouldn't want harm to befall our good leader, yes?""
