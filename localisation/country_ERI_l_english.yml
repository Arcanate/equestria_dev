E_E_rivalry_desc:0 "§RTwo households, both alike in dignity,\nFrom ancient grudge break to new mutiny,\nWhere civil blood makes civil claws unclean.§!\n§W--------------§!\nThe bitter feud between the rival houses of Eyrie and Erie - both houses as irreconcilable to each other as the Sun and Moon, Day and Night - has led to decades of incessant internecine violence between the two heavily militarised houses. Both leaders of the houses claim to be the rightful and legitimate Dukes of Verenia, and both of them refuse to negotiate with each other. The violence will likely continue until one side proves triumphant."

erie.1.t:0 "An Introduction To A Sordid Tale"
erie.1.d:0 "My name is Vincent, the true duke of Verenia. For decades, I've waged a war of unmatched ferocity and fervour over these lands against my accursed half-brother, Iovinus, the false duke. In the past, our ancestors have ruled Verenia and its lush plains, lucrative river trade routes and splendid cities, whose grandeur only increased after we swore fealty to the rising Groverian Empire. However, everything changed after those filthy, uppity revolutionaries tore through the region, and left many of my family hanging on trees, including poor father. With the line of succession unclear, and my vacuous brother unwilling to submit, there was no choice but to fight for the title.\n\nAlas, victory was within my grasp, if it weren't for that trollop Katrina, who absconded with a sizeable portion of my property and soldiers. The endless stalemate developed, and Verenia fell behind in terms of development and population. Indeed, I've even heard that in distant corners of Griffonia, they make jokes of two dunderhead dukes fighting over worthless rocks. To this I say, nay! They do not realise the beauty of this land, which I dearly love with all my heart. I'd love nothing more to see it restored to what it once was, even if in the end I'm forced to submit to some other rising tyrant.\n\nFortunately, my few and faithful retainers (the same cannot be said about the worthless peasants who keep complaining) work tirelessly in achieving the noble goal. Alongside the noble families who are sworn to the Erian Midnight Banner, the most notable griffons in this House are my biological younger brother Cyrille (who in spite of his stuffy attitude, he is a very brave and capable commander), a brilliant mind named Fabrice (provides me with new inventions and drinking company on weekends) and Livio, the court rat (his schemes have not always produced the required information, but he is too valuable to dispose of).\nThese are my capabilities, and I shall stop at nothing to achieve my rightful claim to the throne."
