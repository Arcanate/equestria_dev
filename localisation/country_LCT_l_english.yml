 LCT_rising_militarism:0 "Rising Militarism"
 LCT_rising_militarism_desc:0 "The Lake City Army is a new one, but it has proven in combat against Griffon raiders. Over the last few decades its influence among the citizens and the government has grown, leading to the generals having considerable sway over the government and the government powerless to do anything about it. LCA troops can be seen in every city, their proud, grey uniforms adorned with flowers from passing supporters. Ponies cheer and wave military flags as they march by. They are seen as the defenders of freedom, even if they plot assassinations of elected officials."
