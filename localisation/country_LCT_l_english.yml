 LCT_defenders_of_the_east:0 "Lake City is always the first target for griffons. Centuries of defending our homes have left us ready for any attack those griffons throw at us."

 LCT_guilds_desc:0 "The Merchant families of Lake City own several powerful guilds. These Guilds have a near monopoly on their specialities and can pull strings within the government and military, whilst also keeping the economy tightly under control."
 LCT_rising_militarism:0 "Rising Militarism"
 LCT_rising_militarism_desc:0 "The Lake City Army is a new one, but it has proven in combat against Griffon raiders. Over the last few decades its influence among the citizens and the government has grown, leading to the generals having considerable sway over the government and the government powerless to do anything about it. LCA troops can be seen in every city, their proud, grey uniforms adorned with flowers from passing supporters. Ponies cheer and wave military flags as they march by. They are seen as the defenders of freedom, even if they plot assassinations of elected officials."
