 LCT_rising_militarism_desc:0 "The Lake City Army is a new one, but it has proven in combat against Griffon raiders. Over the last few decades its influence among the citizens and the government has grown, leading to the generals having considerable sway over the government and the government powerless to do anything about it. LCA troops can be seen in every city, their proud, grey uniforms adorned with flowers from passing supporters. Ponies cheer and wave military flags as they march by. They are seen as the defenders of freedom, even if they plot assassinations of elected officials."

A group of knights managed to raise the nearby levies and rally them against the invaders. As of this morning, an official communiqué from the Lake City government has been received demanding the total withdraw of the Order of Longsword from all lands east of the River Panacea. There is no doubt that refusing this offer will result in our total destruction."

The Prince, in his mightily wisdom, has seen fit to support this action and has sent a demand to the Knights to ceases all hostile actions and withdraw from pony lands.\n\nUnfortunetly, this demand was rejected and the Knights have sent their troops, including pony slaves, to fight against us."
