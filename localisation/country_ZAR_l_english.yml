 ZAR_tutor_Umalez: "Find a Tutor For Umalez"
 ZAR_tutor_Umalez_desc: "Princess Umalez is the current heir to the throne; but she is young and inexperienced, still laden with an almost childlike innocence.

 ZAR_send_for_Menes: "Send for Menes"
 ZAR_send_for_Menes_desc: "Menes is a Tobuckian who represents both the merchant class, and a Zarantian-friendly faction in our Western neighbor; aswell as being somewhat of a middlepony between Tobuck's Peashooter and one of our own advisors by the name of Wiwurgh. The first step towards either cooperating with or reclaiming Tobuck is reaching out to Menes."

 ZAR_summit_of_tribes: "The Summit of Tribes"
 ZAR_summit_of_tribes_desc: "Zarantia is only in so many ways a true "state"; it functions much more like a federation with the Queen being it's head and sovereign, whilst still lacking much authority over the many autonomous tribes throughout it's borders. In the interest of keeping the bonds between them strong, the Queen has called a summit to renew oaths of loyalty, distribute gifts, and settle petty differences."
 
 ZAR_review_troops: "Review the Troops"
 ZAR_review_troops_desc: "The Queen has taken it upon herself to inspect the condition of the military; what she finds is a well disciplined and capable force, but with a waning loyality, and wary view of the Queens intentions and capabilities. Atleast none of them were bold enough to say it to her face."
 
 ZAR_colthaginian_contracts: "Search for Colthaginian Contracts"
 ZAR_colthaginian_contracts_desc: "With the current throne feeling strapped for cash and needing to secure it's territory, it has been decided that we should bank our defense and security on a system of strongpoints; Walls around cities, and outposts in towns and strategically important areas.

 ZAR_prepare_mercenaries_desc: "With the contracts sourced and the pay settled, it is now onto us to prepare our fresh legions mercenaries for operations in Colthage; primarily with exercises under Colthaginian generals, educating them on the local terrain, and making sure their equipment is up to the task of modern warfighting."
 
 ZAR_refurbish_walls: "Refurbish the Walls"
 ZAR_refurbish_walls_desc: "Many of our city and border walls are in disrepair; either plagued with structural faults, antiquated fighting positions, or even completely collapsed in some places. While not of much use to the modern army, with a bit of labor these could transition from pitiful artifacts to impenetrable fortifications."
 
 ZAR_send_messengers_to_outposts: "Send Messengers to the Outposts"
 ZAR_send_messengers_to_outposts_desc: "A large number of outposts dedicated to both guarding the border and strategic areas of interest exist within our borders. Due to general negligence on the part of military staffers, these outposts are wildly out of standardization with eachother. Equipping messengers with new orders and instructions on what a regulation outpost should look like is the first step towards fixing this."
 
 ZAR_prepare_welcome_festivities: "Prepare Welcome Festivities"
 ZAR_prepare_welcome_festivities_desc: "It won't be long now before our soldiers return home from their expeditions into foreign territory; as a way to boost the morale of our returning warriors and to display to our citizens the great successes and riches they've found in foreign lands, we will begin preparations for grand festivities, to celebrate their triumph and welcome them home."

 ZAR_securing_land: "Securing the Land"
 ZAR_securing_land_desc: "Though it is an immensely profitable notion, sending our best and strongest away to foreign lands when our own so desperately need security is a far too risky plan of action; Instead, our military will be mostly kept at home to keep the reigns tight on would be rebels and bandits."

 ZAR_organize_war_feast: "Organize a War Feast"
 ZAR_organize_war_feast_desc: "The War Feast is a traditional Zarantian gathering of elder zebras and retired warriors from across the land, it's a time at which elders can tell stories of glory and prestige won in their hayday to crowds of awe-inspired farmers and workers. It is a challenging endevour to ask a Zebra to die for his country, but if he truly believes it will give him purpose, and immortalize his name? He will beg you for a chance to."
 
 ZAR_raid_rebel_tribes: "Raid Rebel Tribes"
 ZAR_raid_rebel_tribes_desc: "Rebellious tribes of Zebras have been a thorn in the side of Zarantia for generations now.

 ZAR_escort_caravans: "Escort the Caravans"
 ZAR_escort_caravans_desc: "Caravans are the lifeblood for much of Zarantia, they keep materials flowing to workshops, trade flowing to and from ports, and food in supply for the less agricultirually inclined townships.

 ZAR_record_favors_from_villages_and_tribes_desc: "In more autonomous parts of Zarantia, there has long been an unspoken system of favors between tribal elders and government officials.

 ZAR_review_treasury: "Review the Treasury"
 ZAR_review_treasury_desc: "With the watchful eyes of advisors and bean-counters, the Queen learns that the state of the Treasury is disparate at best.

 ZAR_focus_on_settled_tribes: "Focus on the Settled Tribes"
 ZAR_focus_on_settled_tribes_desc: "Settled tribes are our bread and butter. We have only so much time and money to spend on the vast peoples in our lands, so we should obviously focus it into the more familiar villages and tribes that have settled down into permanent homes and feed themselves on organized agriculture. Nomadism is a way of the past, and sustaining it will only deprive more deserving, modern peoples."

 ZAR_focus_on_nomads_desc: "The Nomadic peoples that make their homes (Even if just seasonally) inside the borders of Zarantia have for a long time remained elusive and hard to keep track of, but with a bit of investment we can surely make them feel welcome, and act productive."

 ZAR_visit_desert_allies_desc: "Despite the obvious differences in lifestyle, the Zarantian government enjoys a very good relationship with many bands of Zebharan nomads. Sending a few Zebras of note to negotiate with and check up on these trusted friends would surely be to both of our benefit."

 ZAR_repair_the_wells: "Repair the Wells"
 ZAR_repair_the_wells_desc: "It can be very challenging for a Nomadic group to maintain good stocks of water, which is why many years ago they paid the Zarantian throne to commission many wells at outposts far away from natural watering holes. These have since fallen into repair and our friends have suffered for it. We should repair this, if not as a point of principle, just to show them that their woes are not forgotten."
 
 ZAR_distribute_livestock: "Distribute Livestock"
 ZAR_distribute_livestock_desc: "Pack animals and milkable livestock are the lifeblood of any nomadic horde, and as such we should offer surplus livestock animals as gifts to Nomadic tribes in order to build favor and goodwill with them.

 ZAR_purchase_slaves: "Purchase Educated Slaves"

 ZAR_send_help_for_harvest_desc: "The field can be a fickle and unpredictable thing; sometimes it is untenable and barren, other times it is overflowing with crops and overwhelming the usually small staff of farmers that tend to it. With a little redistribution of labor, we can help the urban poor find jobs tending and harvesting fields in places which simply do not have enough Zebrapower."
 
 ZAR_recruit_local_expertise: "Recruit the Local Expertise" 
 ZAR_recruit_local_expertise_desc: "There are a variety of benefits to living the settled life, the specialization of work being the most notable of them. City based guilds produce and train skilled craftsmen fit for all walks of life, many of them could be enticed to work for us if we guarantee them an apprenticeship."
 
 ZAR_restock_Aghzat_granaries: "Restock the Aghzat Granaries"
 ZAR_restock_Aghzat_granaries_desc: "The Great Aghzat Granaries of old were once the greastest tool a king or queen would have against the ever-present threat of famine.

 ZAR_taxes_and_tribute: "Taxes and Tributes"
 ZAR_taxes_and_tribute_desc: "Whether they be settled city dwellers, or elusive nomads; all people within our borders are Zarantian, they live safely and benefit from our achievements and investments. It is only fair that we collect from them one of the few universal constants: Taxes."
