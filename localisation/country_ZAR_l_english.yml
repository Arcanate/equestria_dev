 ZAR_trans_zebharan_caravans:0 "Trans-Zebharan Caravans"

 ZAR_decentralised_system_desc:0 "Zarantia is and has always been a land of many tribes.

 ### Events ###
 
 zarantia.1.t:0 "Queen of the Desert"
 zarantia.1.d:0 "Time was like water, flowing on endlessly, and as much as you grasped for it, it just flowed around your hooves. Even if you achieved great things, time could sweep it away so easily, leaving you standing in the ashes of your successes. Nothing lasted, not even nations, and Aguellid Mekiouzza felt her age weigh down on her. Two years ago, all had been right in the world, and yet then it all had come crashing down.\n\nWas this the legacy she would leave her beloved daughter? A queendom that fled into the desert with its tail between its legs, a capitol in the hooves of criminals and warlords, and a people who had lost faith in her. Decades of work, undone in a hoofful of months, and now she was back where she started all those years ago, now an older, more tired zebra.\n\n"You are brooding, mother." Umalez voice came from behind Mekiouzza as she came up to stand by her mother's side. "You know that you do not need to do this, right? You can retire now, and let me deal with Tobuck. Perhaps the time has come for a younger and more vigorous zebra to take charge? Then you can stay in Agzhat and eat dates. Perhaps it would be a more fitting challenge for you."\n\n"Girl, I will have you caned." Mekiouzza gave her daughter a freezing glare. "I thought I would have peace when your father passed, but his barbed tongue has jumped into your mouth."\n\n"No rest for the wicked, mother, and there is not a greater villain in Zarantia than you." Umalez smile reached from ear to ear.\n\n"That's it, where can I find a cane?" Mekiouzza started looking around herself. She was certain she had seen some reeds she could use somewhere.\n\n"Oh but mother, if you need support to walk I can have one made for you!" Umalez laughed as she fled her mother's wrath." #event describing Mekiouzza, who freed Tobuck in her youth, but now has seen it lost. She ponders the future, her daughter etc."
 zarantia.1.a:0 "That insolent whelp! I am not dead yet..."
 
 zarantia.2.t:0 "The Lost City"
 zarantia.2.d:0 "Amasdag Menes - a trader from Tobuck - had arrived early that morning, and he carried with him news from Tobuck. Said news were enough to make the blood boil, yet Mekiouzza sat calmly on her pew as Menes spoke of Pea Shooter's plans.\n\n"And they say Equestria is the land of friendship," she sighed when Menes was done. "Is there no depth to which he won't sink? Not enough that he squats in our city, he even has the temerity to try to negotiate?"\n\n"It seems that way, your majesty. He asks for one year, and says that at the end of the year the city 'will be given back to you' as he put it... and though he is impudent, I humbly request that the crown repays his diplomacy in kind. Tobuck, much like your tribes, was devastated by the storm king, and though the ponies long for your return, sparing them more violence is the right thing to do."\n\n"A thief has crawled into your house and taken possession of it. Do you drive him out, or sit outside your house to patiently wait for when he deigns to leave?" Mekiouzza responded, Menes bowing his head in response.\n\n"I simply fear that threats, however justified, will only impact what little trade that still can flow to the city. Whatever you choose, though, know that the ponies of Tobuck still long for your return.""

 zarantia.10.a:0 "Steel and bone, fire and blood"
 
 zarantia.11.t:0 "A Route Through the Great Desert"
 zarantia.11.d:0 "Much of the tribes' wealth was built not on warfare, but on trade. For centuries, the Zebhara has been the fastest route to cross the continent, but there are few who have been able to brave the sand ocean. The Imazeeb are among those who have the strength, the skill and the willpower to conquer this desolate region, and from Maregypt to Colthage, merchants have eagerly hired their services to help speed them along their way.\n\nIn the wake of the Storm King's rampage, the caravans that once trekked these dangerous routes have all but disappeared, yet the flow of and desire for commerce has not abated, and there are those who long for the routes to open again. Tobuck might currently be lost to us, but our services are still desired elsewhere." #Zarantia used to be an important route for the trans-zebharan trade, and though it was kinda in shambles after the storm king, it's time to get it going again.
 zarantia.11.a:0 "Once more into the great emptiness."
 
 zarantia.12.t:0 "Returning from the Desert"

 zarantia.12.a:0 "We know these lands, and reap the benefits"

 zarantia.13.t:0 "The Desert Flowering."
 zarantia.13.d:0 "The Zonicians believe that we love the desert. We don't. We endure the desert, but we do not love it. There is nothing in the desert and no zebra needs nothing. We love the rivers that briefly flows through our lands in the winter. We love the times that the rain brings the desert alive with countless flowers and plants, and we love the fields that bring plentiful harvests of sweet fruits and filling grains.\n\nThe Zonicians have lived so long along their verdant coastlines, where the soil provides all that they could dream of, that when they see us eking out a living in the zebhara, they presume it must be a matter of desire rather than necessity. As we carve the wadis and the dried riverbeds into canals and reservoirs, treasuring every drop we are given, we remember Tobuck, that city between the rivers. There, the coastline was ours, and the ponies we liberated from their Warzenan oppressors were our friends. We traded, we feasted together, found love with each other and worked together to build a future together.\n\nTobuck might be lost to us, at least for now, but as we wait to regain that city, we wait, and we carve the desert to give what little it can." #Zarantia might be born in the desert, but they don't really like it. Taking Tobuck was more than just economy, it was a way to get away from the desert. Still, they have managed to make a living in it, and that's cool. 
 zarantia.13.a:0 "We have not forgotten you, pony friends."

###Intro Tree###

 ZAR_the_desert_queen:0 "The Desert Queen"
 ZAR_the_desert_queen_desc:0 "The story of Zarantia is the story of Aguellid Mekiouzza. No zebra before her has managed to bring the Imazeeb tribes together like she did, and during her long life she has become a legend. Yet, the Storm King's rampage and the loss of Tobuck shattered the hope of her twilight years being peaceful."

 ZAR_rats_of_tobuck:0 "The Rat of Tobuck"
 ZAR_rats_of_tobuck_desc:0 "Tobuck was the crown jewel of Zarantia, and the Equestrian that now occupies it is a blight. Yet, he has the backing of powerful warlords, as evident by the fate of those warriors who first rushed to dislodge them. The already weakened Imazeeb are in no position to fight a war, and the pen must rule."

 ZAR_choosing_to_hope:0 "Choosing to Hope"
 ZAR_choosing_to_hope_desc:0 "The Equestrian has given his promise, and unless rivers of blood are spilled, the city remains in his grip either way. Trusting his word and remaining on as good terms as possible with him may well be the best hope the weakened Imazeeb have."

 ZAR_appeasing_the_amsarmud:0 "Appeasing the Amsarmud"
 ZAR_appeasing_the_amsarmud_desc:0 "The Amsarmud are Mekiouzza's most fierce servants, but their loyalty is tied to their honor. The choice to tolerate the Tobuckian intruders robs them of vengeance for our fallen kin, and they are making their voices heard."

 ZAR_reminding_the_rats:0 "Reminding the Rats"
 ZAR_reminding_the_rats_desc:0 "Tobuck is Zarantian by right, and Pea Shooter is a thief and a rat. He shall know his place, and though we are not charging in right now, our warriors wait just beyond the border. A step, a word, a single breath in the wrong direction, and he shall face our fury."

 ZAR_merchant_objections:0 "Merchant Objections"
 ZAR_merchant_objections_desc:0 "Many of our people still have ties to the ponies of Tobuck, and trade is still flowing to some extent. Mekiouzza's threats have ruptured this, as any Imazeeb approaching Tobuck now faces not just scrutiny, but hostility."

 ZAR_the_city_of_brooks:0 "The City of Brooks"
 ZAR_the_city_of_brooks_desc:0 "Agzhat was never more than a gathering place for the tribes, yet with Mekiouzza's ascension it became so much more. It has become a city in its own right, and foreign traders and interests are coming there now that Tobuck is not accessible. Though it is lesser than our lost capitol, it serves us dutifully."

 ZAR_the_old_ways:0 "The Old Ways"
 ZAR_the_old_ways_desc:0 "The Imazeeb have to many always wandered the Zebhara as an unchanging and proud people, staying true to their way of life no matter how the winds blow. This stereotype hides a more complicated truth. Even if many are proud of what they are and hold their traditions close, as many are fluid in their ways and readily change to adapt."

 ZAR_the_sword_or_scale:0 "The Sword or the Scale"
 ZAR_the_sword_or_scale_desc:0 "The Imazeeb are a warlike people, the desert breeds a hardy people, but they are also traders and caravaneers who have earned a living crossing the Zebhara and carrying goods for whoever needs their services."

 ZAR_a_settling_people:0 "A Settling People"
 ZAR_a_settling_people_desc:0 "Nomadism is not some inherent trait of the Imazeeb, it is a way to eke out a living in these harsh lands. Many tribes, especially in the north, have been settled for centuries. They have built their towns and cities much like the zonicians or Maregyptians, and they are no less Imazeeb than their wandering kin."

 ZAR_reaffirming_the_amsisi:0 "Reaffirming the Amsisi"
 ZAR_reaffirming_the_amsisi_desc:0 "The Amsisi is the thread that binds the disparate tribes of the Imazeeb together. Whether warlike or mercantile, settled or nomadic, progressive or traditionalist, all Imazeeb acknowledge it."

 ZAR_the_blue_sage:0 "The Blue Sage"
 ZAR_the_blue_sage_desc:0 "Azerwal Wiwurgh is a zebra of singular wisdom and mercantile skill. Having travelled across northern zebrica for decades, he is a stallion of a thousand stories and a million insights. His return from his latest travels is eagerly awaited by not just Mekiouzza, but all imazeeb."

 ZAR_council_of_the_tribes:0 "The Council of Tribes"
 ZAR_council_of_the_tribes_desc:0 "Unlike the Colthaginian senate or the Maregyptian pharaoh, no imazeeb leader rules without the consent of the tribal chieftains. Mekiouzza has not forgotten this, and she has invited them all for a grand meeting to hear them and to reaffirm their oaths to her."

 ZAR_chief_ironbreaker:0 "Chief Ironbreaker"
 ZAR_chief_ironbreaker_desc:0 "No tribe is as martially inclined as the Amsarmud, and no Amsarmud as able as Zawgha. On orders from Mekiouzza, she went to Colthage to gather all those imazeeb who served there as mercenaries and to curry favour among our old clients. Much imazeeb blood has been spilled for the zonicians. Hopefully they will honor this."

 ZAR_trans_zebharan_trade:0 "Trans-Zebharan Trade"
 ZAR_trans_zebharan_trade_desc:0 "The Storm King's rampage left the Trans-Zebharan trade devastated, and it is a shadow of what it once was. It will take years for it to grow back if it is not helped along. By royal decree, the caravans shall be restored greater than ever before."

 ZAR_messages_to_azir:0 "Assuaging the Azir Tribes"
 ZAR_messages_to_azir_desc:0 "The Azir tribes are a breed of their own, and the Imazeeb know well that if you wish to traverse their lands, you will respect them. Gifts of peace will help them overlook our trespasses, and extra precautions among the caravans will lower the risk of incidents."

 ZAR_muster_guards:0 "Muster Guards"
 ZAR_muster_guards_desc:0 "The Zebhara is a place of a thousand perils, from raiders to monsters, and the zebras who take on the duties of the caravans must be up to the task. Those who buy our services pay well for our protection, and we will not let them down."

 ZAR_a_grand_caravan:0 "A Grand Caravan"
 ZAR_a_grand_caravan_desc:0 "From Agzhat we will cut a path down to Camelkand, bypassing the Quaggatai lands and reaching the southeast in record time. This caravan is more than just a trading expedition, it is an affirmation that the imazeeb are still able and willing to master the Zebhara."

 ZAR_our_desert:0 "Our Desert"
 ZAR_our_desert_desc:0 "For centuries, the Imazeeb have not only survived but even thrived in lands that others find too harsh. Part of the key has been to never simply accept the desert for what it is. It can become more, and whether it will take decades or centuries, the imazeeb are patient."

 ZAR_a_hundred_tribes:0 "A Hundred Tribes"
 ZAR_a_hundred_tribes_desc:0 "Mekiouzza's greatest achievment is, and will always be, the fact that she created a measure of true unity among her people. Even after recent events this unity is weakened, but not broken, and it will be enough to ensure that when she is gone, her daughter is accepted by them."

 ZAR_rebuilding_and_recovering:0 "Rising up Once More"
 ZAR_rebuilding_and_recovering_desc:0 "The Storm King caused untold suffering among the imazeeb, yet they did what they always had and adapted. The greedy yeti chose to go after the wealthier cities instead of chasing them up and down the dunes. Though the dead never can come back, the material damage wrought can be repaired."

 ZAR_new_year_new_hope:0 "New Year, New Hope"
 ZAR_new_year_new_hope_desc:0 "Having done all she could, Mekiouzza has withdrawn from public life. A lifetime was given for her people, but now she will rest. The future awaits, but it will be her daughter's future."

 ###Army tree###

 ZAR_issue_of_war:0 "The Issue of War"
 ZAR_issue_of_war_desc:0 "Whilst the courage and skill of our irregular warriors is without question, we can double their effectiveness by developing a coherent doctrine. We must gather our commanders and make a decision as to what that might be."

 ZAR_the_desert_masters:0 "The Masters of the Desert"
 ZAR_the_desert_masters_desc:0 "We have decided to expand upon our traditional tactics, which largely consist of light, mobile units specialised in moving across open ground at speed and out-manoeuvring the enemy."

 ZAR_supply_caches:0 "Disseminating Supply Caches"
 ZAR_supply_caches_desc:0 "Every hunter or traveller worth their salt have known that a journey across the desert becomes infinitely easier if you made sure to set up supplies along the route the last time you travelled."  

 ZAR_listen_to_old_masters:0 "Listen to the Old Masters"
 ZAR_listen_to_old_masters_desc:0 "When queens and generals march, it is all too easy to forget the vast troves of knowledge that can be found among the old warriors. Those who fought when Mekiouzza was still young still remain, and they have much to teach still."

 ZAR_tribal_armories:0 "Tribal Gunsmithing"
 ZAR_tribal_armories_desc:0 "The best weapon in the world does not avail a warrior if it sits across the country. Instead of attempting to centralise our arms production, we should make sure that every town and every travelling group can produce their own weapons as needed."

 ZAR_history_guides_us:0 "History Guides Us"
 ZAR_history_guides_us_desc:0 "Are not tanks simply the chariots of Maregypt come again? Is not artillery the logical conclusion to the siege engines of Colthage? There is little that is new under the sun, and history can teach us how to move forward."

 ZAR_tribal_levy:0 "Calling the Tribal Levy"
 ZAR_tribal_levy_desc:0 "It would be wrong to expect our warriors to sit around for months on end, waiting for something to do. They have their own lives and their own families to care for. They will come when we call them, so there is no reason to worry."

 ZAR_warrior_pride:0 "A Warrior's Pride"
 ZAR_warrior_pride_desc:0 "Beyond duty and beyond honor, beyond all the reasons to fight, lies a pure and simple desire to not lose. To be imazeeb is to persevere against all that the desert throws at you. To be a warrior, is to persevere no matter what your foe attempts."

 ZAR_born_to_endure:0 "Born to Endure"
 ZAR_born_to_endure_desc:0 "Through the freezing nights and the sweltering days, through endless sandstorms and days of nothing, anywhere and everywhere, we will push on towards victory. The soft coastal zebras call it insanity, but we know it as something we were born to do."

 ZAR_the_desert_demons:0 "The Desert Demons"
 ZAR_the_desert_demons_desc:0 "These raiders and assassins are unequalled, and they are willing to share their knowledge with us. The price is steep, but having them serve as our scouts will be a boon unlike any we could have hoped for."

 ZAR_learning_from_the_west:0 "Learning from the West"
 ZAR_learning_from_the_west_desc:0 "Our present mode of warfare is unsuited to contemporary combat. We must develop a modern army, under the tutelage of our western neighbours. Such a force would be much better able to hold ground."

 ZAR_to_fight_for_all:0 "To Fight for All"
 ZAR_to_fight_for_all_desc:0 "The defense of Zarantia takes precedence over all other concerns, be they mercenary work abroad, inter-tribal squabbles or any other thing. When the full might of the imazeeb is levied thusly, it will be a force to be reckoned with."

 ZAR_courting_the_colthaginians:0 "Courting the Colthaginians"
 ZAR_courting_the_colthaginians_desc:0 "Our ties to Colthage are strong, and turning to them for greater insight into modern warfare is a natural. They've made use of our mercenaries for centuries, and we have many contacts among their generals. It is just a matter of asking."

 ZAR_fledgling_arms_industry:0 "A Fledgling Arms Industry"
 ZAR_fledgling_arms_industry_desc:0 "The modern wars will be fought with countless different tools, and we are lagging far behind. The arms industry of Tobuck is not available to us, so if we are to defend ourselves, we must build an industry of our own."

 ZAR_unified_principles_of_warfare:0 "The Unified Principles of Warfare"
 ZAR_unified_principles_of_warfare_desc:0 "Certain things are forever true when it comes to war, but the ways in which these things are expressed changes as time marches on. We must make sure to follow these changes, and be up to date with all the new methods of warfare."

 ZAR_cross_tribal_service:0 "Cross-Tribal Service"
 ZAR_cross_tribal_service_desc:0 "The Imazeeb must learn to fight for more than tribe or town. By spreading them out so that soldiers serve in other tribes, we reinforce the bonds between them, and lay the foundation for greater faith in Amsisi."

 ZAR_desert_tunnels:0 "Desert Tunnels"
 ZAR_desert_tunnels_desc:0 "It is a mad notion, but there is a precedent for it in the countless smuggler and escape tunnels dug not only around Tobuck but across Zarantia. If our enemy can strike from above, then we simply strike from below. A corps of assault engineers, specialising in tunnel assaults, can become our ace."

 ZAR_royal_chargers:0 "The Royal Chargers"
 ZAR_royal_chargers_desc:0 "Queen Mekiouzza gathers the best around her, and the warriors are no exception. Those warriors hoof-picked by her will become a cadre of chargers unlike any that Zarantia has seen. They are the best of the best, the fiercest and bravest, they are the Royal Zarantian Chargers, and the ground quakes under their hooves."

 ZAR_arsenal_of_defense:0 "The Arsenal of Defense"
 ZAR_arsenal_of_defense_desc:0 "If Zarantia is to remain be safe, we must never stop continuing in our efforts to procure new weapons, nor can we ever presume that we are "done" with improving our military production capacity."


###Political Tree###

 ZAR_issue_of_unity:0 "The Issue of Unity"
 ZAR_issue_of_unity_desc:0 "The loss of Tobuck is more than the loss of a city, it is an existential threat to Zarantia itself. If a gaggle of warlords and gun runners can run us out of the city, then what will stop any outside force from crushing our fledgling state for good? We must come together, or we will fall."
 ZAR_i_am_mekiouzza:0 "I am Mekiouzza"
 ZAR_i_am_mekiouzza_desc:0 "I brought the tribes together. I led the war to free Tobuck from Warzena's clutches. I forged Zarantia as a concept, and I maintained it. It is mine by right, as none of the other chieftains could even come close to accomplish what I accomplished. Zarantia is mine, and I will drown it in blood before I allow it to fall."
 ZAR_bringing_the_tribes_together:0 "Bringing the Tribes Together"
 ZAR_bringing_the_tribes_together_desc:0 "Zarantia is - must be - one united force. The tribes can no longer claim independence from it, and they must be given their place in the order that now arises. Their place will be given willingly and generously, but they will take it, or else..."
 ZAR_enforce_the_amsisi:0 "Enforce the Amsisi"
 ZAR_enforce_the_amsisi_desc:0 "There are those who would not view those outside their tribe as kin, but as outsiders. They would show hospitality, but only as much as is needed, and they would make excuses when called to defend those who would come to their aid. There is a word for this: betrayal, and it is time to remind them of this. "
 ZAR_remember_your_friends:0 "Remember Your Friends"
 ZAR_remember_your_friends_desc:0 "Some of our people have stood by the Queen's side since the beginning. They have shown more than just recognition of her ability and given her loyalty. Through thick and thin, they have stood by her side, and the queen does not forget this."
 ZAR_taking_their_oaths:0 "Demanding their Oaths"
 ZAR_taking_their_oaths_desc:0 "The time has come for the queen's power to be based on more than honor and custom. Those who stand by her will swear oaths to serve her, no matter what order she gives. If they do not give it, they have no place under her."
 ZAR_reward_the_loyal:0 "Reward the Loyal"
 ZAR_reward_the_loyal_desc:0 "For the headstrong tribes of Zarantia, blind obedience is not a virtue, but a strange foreign notion. In order to ease their transit into the fold, there must be generous rewards for those who bow their heads to the queen."
 ZAR_we_unite_or_die:0 "We Unite or Die"
 ZAR_we_unite_or_die_desc:0 "The loss of Tobuck is more than the loss of a city, it is an existential threat to Zarantia itself. If a gaggle of warlords and gun runners can run us out of the city, then what will stop any outside force from crushing our fledgling state for good?"
 ZAR_for_my_people:0 "For my People"
 ZAR_for_my_people_desc:0 "Mekiouzza's life has been one long struggle to bring the Imazeeb together, and to lead not just a tribe, but a people. Time and time again, the world has contested her, but time and time again she has pushed on. Calling on every favour she has, she will achieve her goals no matter the cost."
 ZAR_crush_those_who_would_divide_us:0 "Crush those who Would Divide Us"
 ZAR_crush_those_who_would_divide_us_desc:0 "Chieftains object to Mekiouzza's plans, and tribes turn away from her. With their actions, they threaten to undo all that the Queen has accomplished. Generous gifts have failed, threats fallen on deaf ears.\n\nSo be it, either they die, or Zarantia dies."
 ZAR_they_blinked_first:0 "They Blinked First"
 ZAR_they_blinked_first_desc:0 "The savagery and speed with which Mekiouzza turned on her people has shocked the other tribes, and though many would willingly fight, it has been made clear that any tribe that turned against her would not find battle, but a slaughter. In blood and fire, Zarantia stays united."
 ZAR_a_true_queen:0 "A True Queen"
 ZAR_a_true_queen_desc:0 "Mekiouzza's place is carved into the annals of legend. For the first time, the Imazeeb are truly united. It happened in blood and death, but they now stand as one people. Queen Mekiouzza now leads her nation and her people forward to the future, for no other imazeeb was worthy."

 ZAR_the_tribe_of_tribes:0 "The Tribe of Tribes"
 ZAR_the_tribe_of_tribes_desc:0 "The imazeeb have always been a people of many tribes, but the question is whether that truly is a weakness. Certainly it precludes autocratic methods, but how many foreign thinkers have not written about the importance of checks and balances? We have that, always had it, and we simply need to refine it."
 ZAR_a_common_code:0 "A Common Code"
 ZAR_a_common_code_desc:0 "The tribes value their customs and traditions, and if unity is to be reached, these things must be respected. It will demand all the effort that we can muster, but the reward will be a Zarantia that the tribes feel invested in."
 ZAR_tribal_council:0 "The Tribal Council"
 ZAR_tribal_council_desc:0 "Mekiouzza has a long tradition of calling the tribal chieftains to her to counsel her. Perhaps this institution should be made permanent, and give the tribal chiefs a formalised say in Zarantia's governance."
 ZAR_establish_high_courts:0 "Establishing High Courts"
 ZAR_establish_high_courts_desc:0 "Inter-tribal squabbles take up too much time and effort that would be better spent elsewhere. In order to relieve the burden this places on the queen, we must create a pan-Zarantian justice system of neutral mediators that can speak with the queen's authority."
 ZAR_the_code_of_rights:0 "The Code of Rights"
 ZAR_the_code_of_rights_desc:0 "There must never be any doubt in the minds of our people that we will respect their way of life. Our commitment to preserving the rights our people always have known shall be written into the very fabric of our nation, and if we fail in it then we will be held accountable."
 ZAR_selling_unity:0 "Selling Unity"
 ZAR_selling_unity_desc:0 ""Unity" is a strange ideal to most imazeeb, and if we are to convince them to change their ways and embrace it, we must offer them a lot in return. If it succeeds, it will be the sale of the century, and Mekiouzza is no stranger to pulling off difficult sales." 
 ZAR_making_deals_and_promises:0 "Making Deals and Promises"
 ZAR_making_deals_and_promises_desc:0 "It will not be one great agreement that brings Zarantia together, but rather hundreds of small purchases and thousands of promises of aid or reward, arbitration, gifts and carefully chosen words."
 ZAR_pressure_the_unwilling_tribes:0 "Pressure the Unwilling Tribes"
 ZAR_pressure_the_unwilling_tribes_desc:0 "Not all tribes are open to unity, and some - like the Talat and their proud chieftain Wasif - fiercely defend their independence. Yet the Talat are poor, and where brute force might fail, a slow, steady squeeze might do better."
 ZAR_the_best_and_only_option:0 "The Best and Only Option"
 ZAR_the_best_and_only_option_desc:0 "Unity will bring peace and prosperity, it will ensure our people's continued existence and it will ennoble our people in the eyes of the rest of the world. It is a fantastic deal, and so it is understandable that we do not take no for an answer."
 ZAR_oaths_of_mutual_defense:0 "Oaths of Mutual Defense"
 ZAR_oaths_of_mutual_defense_desc:0 "If anything threatens one tribe, it threatens them all. This has always been the case, so formalising it is not an idea foreign to the tribes. Of all the changes that will come, it is probably the least controversial one, and it will let us mobilise much faster if needed."
 ZAR_a_chosen_council:0 "A Chosen Council"
 ZAR_a_chosen_council_desc:0 "As many chieftains are unwilling to sit by Mekiouzza's side, and would rather attend their own affairs, the queen has suggested that instead of the chieftain representing the tribe on the tribal council, it will choose a representative to fulfil this role. With these chosen representatives at her side, Mekiouzza's control is complete, even if not absolute."

# ZAR_summit_of_tribes_desc: "Zarantia is only in so many ways a true "state"; it functions much more like a federation with the Queen being it's head and sovereign, whilst still lacking much authority over the many autonomous tribes throughout it's borders. In the interest of keeping the bonds between them strong, the Queen has called a summit to renew oaths of loyalty, distribute gifts, and settle petty differences."
# 
# ZAR_review_troops: "Review the Troops"
# ZAR_review_troops_desc: "The Queen has taken it upon herself to inspect the condition of the military; what she finds is a well disciplined and capable force, but with a waning loyality, and wary view of the Queens intentions and capabilities. Atleast none of them were bold enough to say it to her face."
# 
# ZAR_colthaginian_contracts: "Search for Colthaginian Contracts"
# ZAR_colthaginian_contracts_desc: "With the current throne feeling strapped for cash and needing to secure it's territory, it has been decided that we should bank our defense and security on a system of strongpoints; Walls around cities, and outposts in towns and strategically important areas. This could prove risky, but it would allow us to continue the longstanding tradition of contracting mercenaries to Colthage for money. "
# 
# ZAR_prepare_mercenaries: "Prepare the Mercenaries"
# ZAR_prepare_mercenaries_desc: "With the contracts sourced and the pay settled, it is now onto us to prepare our fresh legions mercenaries for operations in Colthage; primarily with exercises under Colthaginian generals, educating them on the local terrain, and making sure their equipment is up to the task of modern warfighting."
 
# ZAR_refurbish_walls: "Refurbish the Walls"
# ZAR_refurbish_walls_desc: "Many of our city and border walls are in disrepair; either plagued with structural faults, antiquated fighting positions, or even completely collapsed in some places. While not of much use to the modern army, with a bit of labor these could transition from pitiful artifacts to impenetrable fortifications."
 
# ZAR_send_messengers_to_outposts: "Send Messengers to the Outposts"
# ZAR_send_messengers_to_outposts_desc: "A large number of outposts dedicated to both guarding the border and strategic areas of interest exist within our borders. Due to general negligence on the part of military staffers, these outposts are wildly out of standardization with eachother. Equipping messengers with new orders and instructions on what a regulation outpost should look like is the first step towards fixing this."
 
# ZAR_prepare_welcome_festivities: "Prepare Welcome Festivities"
# ZAR_prepare_welcome_festivities_desc: "It won't be long now before our soldiers return home from their expeditions into foreign territory; as a way to boost the morale of our returning warriors and to display to our citizens the great successes and riches they've found in foreign lands, we will begin preparations for grand festivities, to celebrate their triumph and welcome them home."
 
# ZAR_welcome_back_troops: "Welcome back the Troops" 
# ZAR_welcome_back_troops_desc: "With grizzled Zebras coming home from either mercenary work or patrolling our territories, today marks the day at which the Queen's Plan for the nation finally pays off. With the homeland secured and safe again, we enter a new age of prosperity. Military parades and marches have been planned in all major cities and townships, with Zebras across Zarantia having the day off."
 
# ZAR_securing_land: "Securing the Land"
# ZAR_securing_land_desc: "Though it is an immensely profitable notion, sending our best and strongest away to foreign lands when our own so desperately need security is a far too risky plan of action; Instead, our military will be mostly kept at home to keep the reigns tight on would be rebels and bandits."
 
# ZAR_aguellid_speech: "The Aguellid's Speech"
# ZAR_aguellid_speech_desc: "With a plan for the future drawn up and soldiers across the country mobilizing, Queen Mekiouzza prepares to orate a rousing speech about what hardships will come, and the great rewards these brave few will reap."
 
# ZAR_organize_war_feast: "Organize a War Feast"
# ZAR_organize_war_feast_desc: "The War Feast is a traditional Zarantian gathering of elder zebras and retired warriors from across the land, it's a time at which elders can tell stories of glory and prestige won in their hayday to crowds of awe-inspired farmers and workers. It is a challenging endevour to ask a Zebra to die for his country, but if he truly believes it will give him purpose, and immortalize his name? He will beg you for a chance to."
 
# ZAR_raid_rebel_tribes: "Raid Rebel Tribes"
# ZAR_raid_rebel_tribes_desc: "Rebellious tribes of Zebras have been a thorn in the side of Zarantia for generations now. Raiding supply caravans, pillaging farms, stealing villagers into slavery; it's high time we did something about it, and conducted raids on their hideouts, homes, and gatherings."
 
# ZAR_escort_caravans: "Escort the Caravans"
# ZAR_escort_caravans_desc: "Caravans are the lifeblood for much of Zarantia, they keep materials flowing to workshops, trade flowing to and from ports, and food in supply for the less agricultirually inclined townships. We would be remiss not to assign atleast some of our manpower towards protecting these critical parts of our infrastructure." 
 
# ZAR_record_favors_from_villages_and_tribes: "Record Favors from Villages and Tribes"
# ZAR_record_favors_from_villages_and_tribes_desc: "In more autonomous parts of Zarantia, there has long been an unspoken system of favors between tribal elders and government officials. With all the work going into these secluded population centers, we should start cataloging our deeds done for them, incase they ever need reminding of how much they truly owe us."
 
# ZAR_review_treasury: "Review the Treasury"
# ZAR_review_treasury_desc: "With the watchful eyes of advisors and bean-counters, the Queen learns that the state of the Treasury is disparate at best. With barely enough funding to run and improve the kingdom, much will need to be done if she wishes to expand her borders and increase Zarantian productivity."
 
# ZAR_focus_on_settled_tribes: "Focus on the Settled Tribes"
# ZAR_focus_on_settled_tribes_desc: "Settled tribes are our bread and butter. We have only so much time and money to spend on the vast peoples in our lands, so we should obviously focus it into the more familiar villages and tribes that have settled down into permanent homes and feed themselves on organized agriculture. Nomadism is a way of the past, and sustaining it will only deprive more deserving, modern peoples."
 
# ZAR_focus_on_nomads: "Focus on the Nomads"
# ZAR_focus_on_nomads_desc: "The Nomadic peoples that make their homes (Even if just seasonally) inside the borders of Zarantia have for a long time remained elusive and hard to keep track of, but with a bit of investment we can surely make them feel welcome, and act productive."
 
# ZAR_visit_desert_allies: "Visit our Desert Allies" 
# ZAR_visit_desert_allies_desc: "Despite the obvious differences in lifestyle, the Zarantian government enjoys a very good relationship with many bands of Zebharan nomads. Sending a few Zebras of note to negotiate with and check up on these trusted friends would surely be to both of our benefit."
 
# ZAR_recruit_promising_soldiers: "Recruit Promising Soldiers" 
# ZAR_recruit_promising_soldiers_desc: "The life of a Nomad is by no means an easy one. Between the constant traveling, hunting, and fighting off raiders the average nomad nears the height of Zebrican endurance and Willpower. These make them an obvious choice for soldiering, especially when combined with their extensive understanding of local terrain and other Nomadic groups."
 
# ZAR_repair_the_wells: "Repair the Wells"
# ZAR_repair_the_wells_desc: "It can be very challenging for a Nomadic group to maintain good stocks of water, which is why many years ago they paid the Zarantian throne to commission many wells at outposts far away from natural watering holes. These have since fallen into repair and our friends have suffered for it. We should repair this, if not as a point of principle, just to show them that their woes are not forgotten."
 
# ZAR_distribute_livestock: "Distribute Livestock"
# ZAR_distribute_livestock_desc: "Pack animals and milkable livestock are the lifeblood of any nomadic horde, and as such we should offer surplus livestock animals as gifts to Nomadic tribes in order to build favor and goodwill with them. While not much cost for us, it will build a lifetime of trust for the people that survive off these cherished creatures."
 
# ZAR_purchase_slaves: "Purchase Educated Slaves"
# ZAR_purchase_slaves_desc: "Between the tribes native to Zebrica, and the many invading forces with little regard for the natives they encounter, the continent enjoys a healthy slave market; even if frowned upon in many circles, slaves are bought and sold in nearly every city in Zebrica. Amongst these are a few well educated types, with promises of freedom and a new life in Zarantia, they'd be more than happy to work for us." 
 
# ZAR_participate_in_city_fairs: "Participate in City Fairs"
# ZAR_participate_in_city_fairs_desc: "City fairs are a large part of Zarantian culture, they remove workers from the drudgery of labor and leave them in a world of fun games, good drink, and warm food; We should ensure that every local fair has a bit of government money and a few representatives in the mix, this way we can facilitate the trade of luxury goods and amenities to these celebrations, raking in mountains of taxes as a result."
 
# ZAR_send_help_for_harvest: "Send Help for Harvests"
# ZAR_send_help_for_harvest_desc: "The field can be a fickle and unpredictable thing; sometimes it is untenable and barren, other times it is overflowing with crops and overwhelming the usually small staff of farmers that tend to it. With a little redistribution of labor, we can help the urban poor find jobs tending and harvesting fields in places which simply do not have enough Zebrapower."
 
# ZAR_recruit_local_expertise: "Recruit the Local Expertise" 
# ZAR_recruit_local_expertise_desc: "There are a variety of benefits to living the settled life, the specialization of work being the most notable of them. City based guilds produce and train skilled craftsmen fit for all walks of life, many of them could be enticed to work for us if we guarantee them an apprenticeship."

# ZAR_restock_Aghzat_granaries: "Restock the Aghzat Granaries"
# ZAR_restock_Aghzat_granaries_desc: "The Great Aghzat Granaries of old were once the greastest tool a king or queen would have against the ever-present threat of famine. Many decades have made us complacent however, and the stockpile has slowly dribbled down to nothing but old, spoiling wheat. It would be prudent to take a more proactive stance on this, aswell as siphoning off a percentage of grain production towards restocking Aghzat."
 
# ZAR_taxes_and_tribute: "Taxes and Tributes"
# ZAR_taxes_and_tribute_desc: "Whether they be settled city dwellers, or elusive nomads; all people within our borders are Zarantian, they live safely and benefit from our achievements and investments. It is only fair that we collect from them one of the few universal constants: Taxes."
