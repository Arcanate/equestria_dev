 ### Events ###
 
 zarantia.1.t:0 "The Aguellid"
 zarantia.1.d:0 "Time was like water, flowing on endlessly, and as much as you grasped for it, it just flowed around your hooves. Even if you achieved great things, time could sweep it away so easily, leaving you standing in the ashes of your successes. Nothing lasted, not even nations, and Mekiouzza Ataghan felt her age weigh down on her. Two years ago, all had been right in the world, and yet then it all had come crashing down.\n\nWas this the legacy she would leave her beloved daughter? A nation that had fled into the desert with its tail between its legs, a capitol in the hooves of criminals and warlords, and a people who had lost faith in her. Decades of work, undone in a hoofful of months.  Now she was back where she started all those years ago, now an older, more tired zebra.\n\n"You are brooding, mother." Umalez voice came from behind Mekiouzza as she came up to stand by her mother's side. "You know that you do not need to do this, right? You can retire now, and let me deal with Tobuck. Perhaps the time has come for a younger and more vigorous zebra to take charge? Then you can stay in Agzhat and eat dates. Perhaps it would be a more fitting challenge for you."\n\n"Girl, I will have you caned." Mekiouzza gave her daughter a freezing glare. "I thought I would have peace when your father passed, but his barbed tongue has jumped into your mouth."\n\n"No rest for the wicked, mother, and there is not a greater villain in Zarantia than you." Umalez smile reached from ear to ear.\n\n"That's it, where can I find a cane?" Mekiouzza started looking around herself. She was certain she had seen some reeds she could use somewhere.\n\n"Oh but mother, if you need support to walk I can have one made for you!" Umalez laughed as she fled her mother's wrath."
 zarantia.1.a:0 "I am not dead yet, you insolent whelp!"
 
 zarantia.2.t:0 "The Lost City"
 zarantia.2.d:0 "Menes Amasdag - a trader from Tobuck - had arrived early that morning, and he carried with him news from Tobuck. Said news were enough to make the blood boil, yet Mekiouzza sat calmly on her pew as Menes spoke of Pea Shooter's plans.\n\n"And they say Equestria is the land of friendship," she sighed when Menes was done. "Is there no depth to which he won't sink? Not enough that he squats in our city, he even has the temerity to try to negotiate?"\n\n"It seems that way, your majesty. He asks for one year, and says that at the end of the year the city 'will be given back to you' as he put it... and though he is impudent, I humbly request that the crown repays his diplomacy in kind. Tobuck, much like your tribes, was devastated by the storm king, and though the ponies long for your return, sparing them more violence is the right thing to do."\n\n"A thief has crawled into your house and taken possession of it. Do you drive him out, or sit outside your house to patiently wait for when he deigns to leave?" Mekiouzza responded, Menes bowing his head in response.\n\n"I simply fear that threats, however justified, will only impact what little trade that still can flow to the city. Whatever you choose, though, know that the ponies of Tobuck still long for your return."" 
 zarantia.2.a:0 "Pea Shooter is a rat, and he shall be aware of where he stands."
 zarantia.2.b:0 "It is humiliating, but we can ill afford pride."
 
 zarantia.3.t:0 "From the Chaos, Growth"
 zarantia.3.d:0 "As you reach the highlands of northern Zarantia, the desert slowly gives way to rolling grasslands, which in turn become hills criss-crossed by small brooks. These lands are as fertile as you will find anywhere in Zarantia, and the valleys are filled with olive groves, fields of sorghum and cassava and even vineyards. Cool winds blow in from the north, contesting the hot, dry Zebhara, and gives the region periods of refreshing cool.\n\nHere, nested on the slopes of a large ridge, lies the city of Aghzat. It is a modest place by international standards, with buildings out of mud bricks and rammed earth. The buildings are - unlike the Zonician cities of the coast - built for defense as much as anything else, with many of them almost akin to small fortresses. Yet it is also a place of rapid change. Before the storm king, Colthaginian and Maregyptian investors had both seen the potential in this city, and industries have sprung up in the region. Foreigners are a more common sight than ever before as it escaped destruction and has became one of the few places still fully intact, and thus the best place to do business. The merchants and craftsponies that fled Tobuck and Pea Shooter's reign have settled among the Zarantians as well, doing their part in helping to raise the city up.\n\nThough the last years have been hard on the Aguellid and on Zarantia, for Aghzat, they have been good."
 zarantia.3.a:0 "It's no Tobuck, but it's a good home."

 zarantia.4.t:0 "A Changing World" 
 zarantia.4.d:0 ""Why did we take Tobuck, my daughter?" Mekiouzza asked Umalez before taking a sip of her tea. "Not 'when', or 'under what pretext', but why?"\n\n"Because it was our gateway to modernity. Holding Tobuck would let our people rise to become akin to Colthage, or Maregypt."\n\n"Yes, we would seize a modern city, leave our old ways behind and become like the zonicians, with no trouble. That was why we failed. Yes, failed. Our people are bound by traditions millennia in the making. The future is like the Emerald Sea, vast, inviting, and we galloped out of the desert towards it when we took Tobuck... but the sea can drown you. You can become lost in it, and it is no less deadly than the Zebhara. If we do not have ourselves, then what do we have?"\n\n"And losing our old ways to start playing at being zonicians would make us what? Imposters, dancing to a foreign tune not ours?" Umalez nodded as she noticed mother's point. "But at the same time, that unwillingness to change is what lost us Tobuck."\n\n"Was it?" Mekiouzza asked pointedly. "Or was it blind faith that progress would be inevitable, and that my people had to lose themselves in order to be safe? Or..." she smiled wryly. "Maybe that is just simple fear speaking? It's so easy to flee and refuse to give up anything, and then you've already lost. Clinging to what drags you down can drown you even in shallower seas. It is a difficult issue, but that is why we are here, my daughter...""  
 zarantia.4.a:0 ""We must make sure that they won't lose themselves.""
 zarantia.4.b:0 ""We serve so that the Imazeeb can change on their terms.""

 zarantia.5.t:0 "The Path to Unity" 
 zarantia.5.d:0 ""At times, I do envy the rulers of other nations." Umalez murmured as more tea was poured for her. "Their people might bicker and fight for dominance, but they are still part of the same nation. Being the Aguellid of Zarantia seems to be more akin to herding dragons."\n\n"It is," Mekiouzza responded flatly. "Zarantia is not something written into the fabric of the land. It is an agreement between tribes, and if they feel that the deal is not honored, they will no longer stick around. The question is what the remedy will be."\n\n"In Griffonia, the griffons' empire was brought together through force, and all I've read says that the empire had no shortage of prideful or stubborn peoples. Then again... their empire's a shadow of what it was, and their leader frail."\n\n"Indeed, and yet at least they reached that far. That is more than you can say for many nations. Tribes like ours have worked together in concord, but conquest is how kingdoms have been built."\n\n"And yet aren't these kingdoms rocked by demands for democracy?" Umalez mused. "A hoofful of dragons will defeat an army of sheep. It's true that a cowed people follows more easily, but might not a nation of free zebras be even stronger?"\n\n"High-faluting ideals are dangerous, my daughter...""   
 zarantia.5.a:0 ""If things continue as they are, unity must be forced.""
 zarantia.5.b:0 ""But you are right. Our people must come together on their own terms.""

 zarantia.6.t:0 "A Settling People" 
 zarantia.6.d:0 ""The zonicians are an amusing sort." Mekiouzza said out of the blue. "We have been their neighbours for untold centuries, and yet so many of them think we do not live in towns or villages at all. I recall this one playwright in Colthage who wrote a play where an Imazeeb mare was withering away because she was 'trapped' in the city. I had the misfortune to watch it once when visiting, and I did not know if I was to collapse in laughter, or retrieve a cane and go find the playwright."\n\n"It is so strange. Aghzat lies close to their lands, do they not know how many of us have been settled for centuries?"\n\n"I guess they do not consider those proper Imazeeb. In their mind, you must be nomadic to be a true Imazeeb. Yet... when you consider the opposition between the nomads and the settled, I suppose I see where they get confused."\n\n"How do you manage it?" Umalez asked her mother. "How do you find a balance between the settled and the nomadic?"\n\n"I don't, not really." Mekiouzza said. "Their needs are nigh completely opposed, and perfect balance is a precarious position. To favour none is to be able to trust none, and you need to find those who stand by you utterly. As for me...""  
 zarantia.6.a:0 ""Those nomads helped us claim Tobuck, and I've not forgotten.""
 zarantia.6.b:0 ""I stand by the cities and towns, they are the way forward.""
 
 zarantia.7.t:0 "Everyzebra's Aguellid"
 zarantia.7.d:0 ""When you meet with Mekiouzza Ataghan then be careful." Wasif Talat warned the young colt's by his side. "She is a dangerous mare, maybe even the most dangerous mare you will meet."\n\n"I've heard the stories of her, but all they say is that she fights her enemies, not her allies. Aren't we sworn to aid her? Would she be a threat to us?"\n\n"A greater threat than most zebras you will meet, but not in battle." Wasif smiled at the naive remark. "She is a snake, coiling herself around you, and before you know it, her venom has made you content with being in her clutches. For how could you say no? I remember at one gathering, where she met with Zawgha Amsarmud. You would have thought they would be cold with each other, but Mekiouzza met her with the warmth you give a daughter, inquired about Zawgha's niece and whether she had had her foal yet. Within weeks, she was like a mother to all in their tribe."\n\n"I don't understand. Isn't that a good thing? She's hospitable."\n\n"She ingratiated herself with the Amsarmud like she was everyone's mother, and before long they were so woven into her schemes that they could not pull away without ripping themselves apart. Now they walk by her side, so integrated into the greater Ataghan that they are no longer a whole, but part of something else. That's why she's dangerous. She sees no Talat, or Amsarmud, or Ataghan. All she sees is Imazeeb, and as long as she is Aguellid, she will defend and care for them.""
 zarantia.7.a:0 "Slip up around her, and you too will be her ward."
 
 zarantia.8.t:0 "The Thousand-Mile Traveler" 
 zarantia.8.d:0 "Wiwurgh Tasawent was a slight Zebra, though just how was hard to see thanks to the Tasawent's customary blue robe and veil that covered all but his bespectacled eyes. Yet, his age and his wisdom shone through his obscuring clothes as he placed the books down before Mekiouzza.\n\n "My life's work, such as it is. Alas, I return before you a defeated Zebra." Mekiouzza, whose hoof had travelled over the first book's cover, raised an eyebrow.\n\n"I count eight books, each of them sizeable. Can there be so much in the art of alchemy you still have not learned?"\n\n"For each and everything I learned, I realized there were ten things more to discover." Wiwurgh sighed. "My life's goal, I am afraid, was a far to ambitious one for one single zebra to master. The world is great, greater than we realize, and when we rise to challenge it, it reminds us of how small we are. You saw that a long time ago, did you not? That was why you have sought to unite our people, and elevate us to something different?" Mekiouzza did not answer, only smiled wryly at him, and Wiwurgh bowed his head towards her. " 
 zarantia.8.a:0 ""I am your humble servant, Aguellid.""
 
 zarantia.9.t:0 "The Gathering Tribes" 
 zarantia.9.d:0 "The lands around Agzhat are teeming with activity, as zebras from all over are arriving to join the great meeting of tribes. Tens of thousands of zebras from hundreds of tribes are pouring into the city, each tribe a colourful parade of wealth and power. Yet the mood is not tense, but hopeful. Foals stand on the rooftops, raining down flower petals over the arriving chieftains as music and song fills the air, and as the chieftains arrive at the Aguellid's castle, they are welcomed like kin by the Aguellid.\n\nSome came ready for arguments, straining against the Aguellid's overreach, but they found themselves embraced and led to a sumptious feast before they could say much. Others, who had hoped to converse in private with the Aguellid to curry favour were gently but firmly kept among their peers. Outside the castle, the tribeszebras who came with their chieftains are treated to feasts as well. Every household and every family of the Ataghan have opened their homes and tents, and from the highest to the lowest, all in Agzhat hosts their kin tonight."
 zarantia.9.a:0 "What a gathering!"
 
 zarantia.10.t:0 "Return of the Ironbreaker"

 zarantia.10.a:0 "Steel and bone, fire and blood"
 
 zarantia.11.t:0 "A Route Through the Great Desert"
 zarantia.11.d:0 "Much of the tribes' wealth was built not on warfare, but on trade. For centuries, the Zebhara has been the fastest route to cross the continent, but there are few who have been able to brave the sand ocean. The Imazeeb are among those who have the strength, the skill and the willpower to conquer this desolate region, and from Maregypt to Colthage, merchants have eagerly hired their services to help speed them along their way.\n\nIn the wake of the Storm King's rampage, the caravans that once trekked these dangerous routes have all but disappeared, yet the flow of and desire for commerce has not abated, and there are those who long for the routes to open again. Tobuck might currently be lost to us, but our services are still desired across Zebrica, and we are still here to provide." #Zarantia used to be an important route for the trans-zebharan trade, and though it was kinda in shambles after the storm king, it's time to get it going again.
 zarantia.11.a:0 "Once more into the great emptiness."
 
 zarantia.12.t:0 "Returning from the Desert"  
 zarantia.12.d:0 "Through the Zebhara, down past Quaggatai and into Camelkand and beyond, the caravan has made its way. At several points, its appearance caused worry, even fear, as there were those who thought the approaching caravan was an invasion. Thankfully, our guards could smooth things over, and our merchants could deal in their goods along the route.\n\nThe lands we travelled are still dealing with the aftermath of the Storm King's invasions, and the still devastated towns and villages we saw make it all too clear that it will take months, if not years, to restore them. Yet, life goes on, and there is still the need for trade.\n\nMaybe the goods needed are more practical than they used to be, but the buyers are no less interested. And as long as there is a need for trade, the caravans will be travelling." 
 zarantia.12.a:0 "We know these lands, and reap the benefits"

 zarantia.13.t:0 "The Desert Flowering"
 zarantia.13.d:0 "The Zonicians believe that we love the desert. We don't. We endure the desert, but we do not love it. There is nothing in the desert and no zebra needs nothing. We love the rivers that briefly flows through our lands in the winter. We love the times that the rain brings the desert alive with countless flowers and plants, and we love the fields that bring plentiful harvests of sweet fruits and filling grains.\n\nThe Zonicians have lived so long along their verdant coastlines, where the soil provides all that they could dream of, that when they see us eking out a living in the Zebhara, they presume it must be a matter of desire rather than necessity. As we carve the wadis and the dried riverbeds into canals and reservoirs, treasuring every drop we are given, we remember Tobuck, that city between the rivers. There, the coastline was ours, and the ponies we liberated from their Warzenan oppressors were our friends. We traded, we feasted together, found love with each other and worked together to build a future together.\n\nTobuck might be lost to us, at least for now, but as we wait to regain that city, we wait, and we carve the desert to give what little it can." #Zarantia might be born in the desert, but they don't really like it. Taking Tobuck was more than just economy, it was a way to get away from the desert. Still, they have managed to make a living in it, and that's cool.

###Intro Tree###

 ZAR_the_desert_queen:0 "The Great Aguellid"
 ZAR_the_desert_queen_desc:0 "The story of Zarantia is the story of Mekiouzza Ataghan. No zebra before her has managed to bring the Imazeeb tribes together like she did, and during her long life she has become a legend. Yet, the Storm King's rampage and the loss of Tobuck shattered the hope of her twilight years being peaceful."

 ZAR_rats_of_tobuck:0 "The Rat of Tobuck"
 ZAR_rats_of_tobuck_desc:0 "Tobuck was the crown jewel of Zarantia, and the Equestrian that now occupies it is a blight. Yet, he has the backing of powerful warlords, as evident by the fate of those warriors who first rushed to dislodge them. The already weakened Imazeeb are in no position to fight a war, and the pen must rule."

 ZAR_choosing_to_hope:0 "Choosing to Hope"
 ZAR_choosing_to_hope_desc:0 "The Equestrian has given his promise, and unless rivers of blood are spilled, the city remains in his grip either way. Trusting his word and remaining on as good terms as possible with him may well be the best hope the weakened Imazeeb have."

 ZAR_appeasing_the_amsarmud:0 "Appeasing the Amsarmud"
 ZAR_appeasing_the_amsarmud_desc:0 "The Amsarmud are Mekiouzza's most fierce servants, but their loyalty is tied to their honor. The choice to tolerate the Tobuckian intruders robs them of vengeance for our fallen kin, and they are making their voices heard."

 ZAR_reminding_the_rats:0 "Reminding the Rats"
 ZAR_reminding_the_rats_desc:0 "Tobuck is Zarantian by right, and Pea Shooter is a thief and a rat. He shall know his place, and though we are not charging in right now, our warriors wait just beyond the border. A step, a word, a single breath in the wrong direction, and he shall face our fury."

 ZAR_merchant_objections:0 "Merchant Objections"
 ZAR_merchant_objections_desc:0 "Many of our people still have ties to the ponies of Tobuck, and trade is still flowing to some extent. Mekiouzza's threats have ruptured this, as any Imazeeb approaching Tobuck now faces not just scrutiny, but hostility."

 ZAR_the_city_of_brooks:0 "The City of Brooks"
 ZAR_the_city_of_brooks_desc:0 "Agzhat was never more than a gathering place for the tribes, yet with Mekiouzza's ascension it became so much more. It has become a city in its own right, and foreign traders and interests are coming there now that Tobuck is not accessible. Though it is lesser than our lost capitol, it serves us dutifully."

 ZAR_the_old_ways:0 "The Old Ways"
 ZAR_the_old_ways_desc:0 "The Imazeeb have to many always wandered the Zebhara as an unchanging and proud people, staying true to their way of life no matter how the winds blow. This stereotype hides a more complicated truth. Even if many are proud of what they are and hold their traditions close, as many are fluid in their ways and readily change to adapt."

 ZAR_the_sword_or_scale:0 "The Sword or the Scale"
 ZAR_the_sword_or_scale_desc:0 "The Imazeeb are a warlike people, the desert breeds a hardy people, but they are also traders and caravaneers who have earned a living crossing the Zebhara and carrying goods for whoever needs their services."

 ZAR_a_settling_people:0 "A Settling People"
 ZAR_a_settling_people_desc:0 "Nomadism is not some inherent trait of the Imazeeb, it is a way to eke out a living in these harsh lands. Many tribes, especially in the north, have been settled for centuries. They have built their towns and cities much like the zonicians or Maregyptians, and they are no less Imazeeb than their wandering kin."

 ZAR_reaffirming_the_amsisi:0 "Reaffirming the Amsisi"
 ZAR_reaffirming_the_amsisi_desc:0 "The Amsisi is the thread that binds the disparate tribes of the Imazeeb together. Whether warlike or mercantile, settled or nomadic, progressive or traditionalist, all Imazeeb acknowledge it."

 ZAR_the_blue_sage:0 "The Blue Sage"
 ZAR_the_blue_sage_desc:0 "Tasawent Wiwurgh is a zebra of singular wisdom and mercantile skill. Having travelled across northern zebrica for decades, he is a stallion of a thousand stories and a million insights. His return from his latest travels is eagerly awaited by not just Mekiouzza, but all imazeeb."

 ZAR_council_of_the_tribes:0 "The Council of Tribes"
 ZAR_council_of_the_tribes_desc:0 "Unlike the Colthaginian senate or the Maregyptian pharaoh, no imazeeb leader rules without the consent of the tribal leaders. Mekiouzza has not forgotten this, and she has invited them all for a grand meeting to hear them and to reaffirm their oaths to her."

 ZAR_chief_ironbreaker:0 "Chief Ironbreaker"
 ZAR_chief_ironbreaker_desc:0 "No tribe is as martially inclined as the Amsarmud, and no Amsarmud as able as Zawgha. On orders from Mekiouzza, she went to Colthage to gather all those imazeeb who served there as mercenaries and to curry favour among our old clients. Much imazeeb blood has been spilled for the zonicians. Hopefully they will honor this."

 ZAR_trans_zebharan_trade:0 "Trans-Zebharan Trade"
 ZAR_trans_zebharan_trade_desc:0 "The Storm King's rampage left the Trans-Zebharan trade devastated, and it is a shadow of what it once was. It will take years for it to grow back if it is not helped along. By royal decree, the caravans shall be restored greater than ever before."

 ZAR_messages_to_azir:0 "Assuaging the Azir Tribes"
 ZAR_messages_to_azir_desc:0 "The Azir tribes are a breed of their own, and the Imazeeb know well that if you wish to traverse their lands, you will respect them. Gifts of peace will help them overlook our trespasses, and extra precautions among the caravans will lower the risk of incidents."

 ZAR_muster_guards:0 "Muster Guards"
 ZAR_muster_guards_desc:0 "The Zebhara is a place of a thousand perils, from raiders to monsters, and the zebras who take on the duties of the caravans must be up to the task. Those who buy our services pay well for our protection, and we will not let them down."

 ZAR_a_grand_caravan:0 "A Grand Caravan"
 ZAR_a_grand_caravan_desc:0 "From Agzhat we will cut a path down to Camelkand, bypassing the Quaggatai lands and reaching the southeast in record time. This caravan is more than just a trading expedition, it is an affirmation that the imazeeb are still able and willing to master the Zebhara."

 ZAR_our_desert:0 "Our Desert"
 ZAR_our_desert_desc:0 "For centuries, the Imazeeb have not only survived but even thrived in lands that others find too harsh. Part of the key has been to never simply accept the desert for what it is. It can become more, and whether it will take decades or centuries, the imazeeb are patient."

 ZAR_a_hundred_tribes:0 "A Hundred Tribes"
 ZAR_a_hundred_tribes_desc:0 "Mekiouzza's greatest achievement is, and will always be, the fact that she created a measure of true unity among her people. Even after recent events this unity is weakened, but not broken, and it will be enough to ensure that when she is gone, her daughter is accepted by them."

 ZAR_rebuilding_and_recovering:0 "Rising up Once More"
 ZAR_rebuilding_and_recovering_desc:0 "The Storm King caused untold suffering among the imazeeb, yet they did what they always had and adapted. The greedy yeti chose to go after the wealthier cities instead of chasing them up and down the dunes. Though the dead never can come back, the material damage wrought can be repaired."

 ZAR_new_year_new_hope:0 "New Year, New Hope"
 ZAR_new_year_new_hope_desc:0 "Having done all she could, Mekiouzza has withdrawn from public life. A lifetime was given for her people, but now she will rest. The future awaits, but it will be her daughter's future."

 ###Army tree###

 ZAR_issue_of_war:0 "The Issue of War"
 ZAR_issue_of_war_desc:0 "Whilst the courage and skill of our irregular warriors is without question, we can double their effectiveness by developing a coherent doctrine. We must gather our commanders and make a decision as to what that might be."

 ZAR_the_desert_masters:0 "The Masters of the Desert"
 ZAR_the_desert_masters_desc:0 "We have decided to expand upon our traditional tactics, which largely consist of light, mobile units specialised in moving across open ground at speed and out-manoeuvring the enemy."

 ZAR_supply_caches:0 "Disseminating Supply Caches"
 ZAR_supply_caches_desc:0 "Every hunter or traveller worth their salt have known that a journey across the desert becomes infinitely easier if you made sure to set up supplies along the route the last time you travelled."  

 ZAR_listen_to_old_masters:0 "Listen to the Old Masters"
 ZAR_listen_to_old_masters_desc:0 "When queens and generals march, it is all too easy to forget the vast troves of knowledge that can be found among the old warriors. Those who fought when Mekiouzza was still young still remain, and they have much to teach still."

 ZAR_tribal_armories:0 "Tribal Gunsmithing"
 ZAR_tribal_armories_desc:0 "The best weapon in the world does not avail a warrior if it sits across the country. Instead of attempting to centralise our arms production, we should make sure that every town and every travelling group can produce their own weapons as needed."

 ZAR_history_guides_us:0 "History Guides Us"
 ZAR_history_guides_us_desc:0 "Are not tanks simply the chariots of Maregypt come again? Is not artillery the logical conclusion to the siege engines of Colthage? There is little that is new under the sun, and history can teach us how to move forward."

 ZAR_tribal_levy:0 "Calling the Tribal Levy"
 ZAR_tribal_levy_desc:0 "It would be wrong to expect our warriors to sit around for months on end, waiting for something to do. They have their own lives and their own families to care for. They will come when we call them, so there is no reason to worry."

 ZAR_warrior_pride:0 "A Warrior's Pride"
 ZAR_warrior_pride_desc:0 "Beyond duty and beyond honor, beyond all the reasons to fight, lies a pure and simple desire to not lose. To be Imazeeb is to persevere against all that the desert throws at you. To be a warrior, is to persevere no matter what your foe attempts."

 ZAR_born_to_endure:0 "Born to Endure"
 ZAR_born_to_endure_desc:0 "Through the freezing nights and the sweltering days, through endless sandstorms and days of nothing, anywhere and everywhere, we will push on towards victory. The soft coastal zebras call it insanity, but we know it as something we were born to do."

 ZAR_the_desert_demons:0 "The Desert Demons"
 ZAR_the_desert_demons_desc:0 "These raiders and assassins are unequalled, and they are willing to share their knowledge with us. The price is steep, but having them serve as our scouts will be a boon unlike any we could have hoped for."

 ZAR_learning_from_the_west:0 "Learning from the West"
 ZAR_learning_from_the_west_desc:0 "Our present mode of warfare is unsuited to contemporary combat. We must develop a modern army, under the tutelage of our western neighbours. Such a force would be much better able to hold ground."

 ZAR_to_fight_for_all:0 "To Fight for All"
 ZAR_to_fight_for_all_desc:0 "The defense of Zarantia takes precedence over all other concerns, be they mercenary work abroad, inter-tribal squabbles or any other thing. When the full might of the Imazeeb is levied thusly, it will be a force to be reckoned with."

 ZAR_courting_the_colthaginians:0 "Courting the Colthaginians"
 ZAR_courting_the_colthaginians_desc:0 "Our ties to Colthage are strong, and turning to them for greater insight into modern warfare is a natural. They've made use of our mercenaries for centuries, and we have many contacts among their generals. It is just a matter of asking."

 ZAR_fledgling_arms_industry:0 "A Fledgling Arms Industry"
 ZAR_fledgling_arms_industry_desc:0 "The modern wars will be fought with countless different tools, and we are lagging far behind. The arms industry of Tobuck is not available to us, so if we are to defend ourselves, we must build an industry of our own."

 ZAR_unified_principles_of_warfare:0 "The Unified Principles of Warfare"
 ZAR_unified_principles_of_warfare_desc:0 "Certain things are forever true when it comes to war, but the ways in which these things are expressed changes as time marches on. We must make sure to follow these changes, and be up to date with all the new methods of warfare."

 ZAR_cross_tribal_service:0 "Cross-Tribal Service"
 ZAR_cross_tribal_service_desc:0 "The Imazeeb must learn to fight for more than tribe or town. By spreading them out so that soldiers serve in other tribes, we reinforce the bonds between them, and lay the foundation for greater faith in Amsisi."

 ZAR_desert_tunnels:0 "Desert Tunnels"
 ZAR_desert_tunnels_desc:0 "It is a mad notion, but there is a precedent for it in the countless smuggler and escape tunnels dug not only around Tobuck but across Zarantia. If our enemy can strike from above, then we simply strike from below. A corps of assault engineers, specialising in tunnel assaults, can become our ace."

 ZAR_royal_chargers:0 "The Royal Chargers"
 ZAR_royal_chargers_desc:0 "Mekiouzza gathers the best around her, and the warriors are no exception. Those warriors hoof-picked by her will become a cadre of chargers unlike any that Zarantia has seen. They are the best of the best, the fiercest and bravest, they are the Royal Zarantian Chargers, and the ground quakes under their hooves."

 ZAR_arsenal_of_defense:0 "The Arsenal of Defense"
 ZAR_arsenal_of_defense_desc:0 "If Zarantia is to remain be safe, we must never stop continuing in our efforts to procure new weapons, nor can we ever presume that we are "done" with improving our military production capacity."


###Political Tree###

 ZAR_issue_of_unity:0 "The Issue of Unity"
 ZAR_issue_of_unity_desc:0 "The loss of Tobuck is more than the loss of a city, it is an existential threat to Zarantia itself. If a gaggle of warlords and gun runners can run us out of the city, then what will stop any outside force from crushing our fledgling state for good? We must come together, or we will fall."
 ZAR_i_am_mekiouzza:0 "I am Mekiouzza"
 ZAR_i_am_mekiouzza_desc:0 "I brought the tribes together. I led the war to free Tobuck from Warzena's clutches. I forged Zarantia as a concept, and I maintained it. It is mine by right, as none of the other tribal leaders could even come close to accomplish what I accomplished. Zarantia is mine, and I will drown it in blood before I allow it to fall."
 ZAR_bringing_the_tribes_together:0 "Bringing the Tribes Together"
 ZAR_bringing_the_tribes_together_desc:0 "Zarantia is - must be - one united force. The tribes can no longer claim independence from it, and they must be given their place in the order that now arises. Their place will be given willingly and generously, but they will take it, or else..."
 ZAR_enforce_the_amsisi:0 "Enforce the Amsisi"
 ZAR_enforce_the_amsisi_desc:0 "There are those who would not view those outside their tribe as kin, but as outsiders. They would show hospitality, but only as much as is needed, and they would make excuses when called to defend those who would come to their aid. There is a word for this: betrayal, and it is time to remind them of this."
 ZAR_remember_your_friends:0 "Remember Your Friends"
 ZAR_remember_your_friends_desc:0 "Some of our people have stood by the Aguellid's side since the beginning. They have shown more than just recognition of her ability and given her loyalty. Through thick and thin, they have stood by her side, and Mekiouzza has not forgotten this."
 ZAR_taking_their_oaths:0 "Demanding their Oaths"
 ZAR_taking_their_oaths_desc:0 "The time has come for the Aguellid's power to be based on more than honor and custom. Those who stand by her will swear oaths to serve her, no matter what order she gives. If they do not give it, they have no place under her."
 ZAR_reward_the_loyal:0 "Reward the Loyal"
 ZAR_reward_the_loyal_desc:0 "For the headstrong tribes of Zarantia, blind obedience is not a virtue, but a strange foreign notion. In order to ease their transit into the fold, there must be generous rewards for those who bow their heads to her."
 ZAR_we_unite_or_die:0 "We Unite or Die"
 ZAR_we_unite_or_die_desc:0 "The Imazeeb are weak. Once, we were strong, but this new age is not kind to our kind of people. Tobuck showed this, and desperate situations demand desperate measures. Options that once were abhorrent must be considered."
 ZAR_for_my_people:0 "For my People"
 ZAR_for_my_people_desc:0 "Mekiouzza's life has been one long struggle to bring the Imazeeb together, and to lead not just a tribe, but a people. Time and time again, the world has contested her, but time and time again she has pushed on. Calling on every favour she has, she will achieve her goals no matter the cost."
 ZAR_crush_those_who_would_divide_us:0 "Crush those who Would Divide Us"
 ZAR_crush_those_who_would_divide_us_desc:0 "Leaders object to Mekiouzza's plans, and tribes turn away from her. With their actions, they threaten to undo all that the Aguellid has accomplished. Generous gifts have failed, threats fallen on deaf ears.\n\nSo be it, either they die, or Zarantia dies."
 ZAR_they_blinked_first:0 "They Blinked First"
 ZAR_they_blinked_first_desc:0 "The savagery and speed with which Mekiouzza turned on her people has shocked the other tribes, and though many would willingly fight, it has been made clear that any tribe that turned against her would not find battle, but a slaughter. In blood and fire, Zarantia stays united."
 ZAR_a_true_queen:0 "A True Queen"
 ZAR_a_true_queen_desc:0 "Mekiouzza's place is carved into the annals of legend. For the first time, the Imazeeb are truly united. It happened in blood and death, but they now stand as one people. Queen Mekiouzza now leads her nation and her people forward to the future, for no other Imazeeb was worthy."

 ZAR_the_tribe_of_tribes:0 "The Tribe of Tribes"
 ZAR_the_tribe_of_tribes_desc:0 "The Imazeeb have always been a people of many tribes, but the question is whether that truly is a weakness. Certainly it precludes autocratic methods, but how many foreign thinkers have not written about the importance of checks and balances? We have that, always had it, and we simply need to refine it."
 ZAR_a_common_code:0 "A Common Code"
 ZAR_a_common_code_desc:0 "The tribes value their customs and traditions, and if unity is to be reached, these things must be respected. It will demand all the effort that we can muster, but the reward will be a Zarantia that the tribes feel invested in."
 ZAR_tribal_council:0 "The Tribal Council"
 ZAR_tribal_council_desc:0 "Mekiouzza has a long tradition of calling the tribal leaders to her to counsel her. Perhaps this institution should be made permanent, and give the tribal chiefs a formalised say in Zarantia's governance."
 ZAR_establish_high_courts:0 "Establishing High Courts"
 ZAR_establish_high_courts_desc:0 "Inter-tribal squabbles take up too much time and effort that would be better spent elsewhere. In order to relieve the burden this places on the government, we must create a pan-Zarantian justice system of neutral mediators that can speak with the Aguellid's authority."

 ZAR_selling_unity:0 "Selling Unity"
 ZAR_selling_unity_desc:0 ""Unity" is a strange ideal to most Imazeeb, and if we are to convince them to change their ways and embrace it, we must offer them a lot in return. If it succeeds, it will be the sale of the century, and Mekiouzza is no stranger to pulling off difficult sales."

 ZAR_our_own_ability:0 "Our Own Ability"
 ZAR_our_own_ability_desc:0 "The tribes' ingenuity is the greatest asset at our disposal. After all, they have the know-how in digging deep wells, even if to uncover hidden water deposits rather than oil. There's no reason to doubt that they'll adapt to the new task quite easily."
 ZAR_foreign_assistance:0 "Foreign Assistance"
 ZAR_foreign_assistance_desc:0 "Many foreign nations have delved into oil extraction long before we did. It would be foolish for us not to learn from their methods, and their experts have surely much to teach us for the right price. Still, many wonder if depending to foreign expertise is truly a wise choice."
 ZAR_the_oil_fund:0 "The Oil Fund"

 ZAR_modern_science_and_society_desc:0 "As more and more complex machinery are introduced, we can no longer depend on the experience of foreign experts. Curriculums must be revised and new specialised schools opened for eager young minds. There, Zarantia's future will truly take form."


 #### Leader Descriptions ####

 ZAR_mekiouzza_desc:0 "§YBorn§!:19th of February 941 in northern Zarantia.\n\n§YBiography§!: Mekiouzza was born as the oldest child of of the leader of the Ataghan tribe, and her talent for leadership showed itself when the Tobuckian envoys came to seek aid from the imazeeb tribes. First to pledge herself to aid them, she managed to both convince her parents as well as many others to join the cause. What more, her zeal impressed the Tobuckians, and as the tribes moved to liberate the city from its Warzenan overlords, the Ataghan was able to set the agenda. And within the tribe, the agenda became set by young Mekiouzza.\n\nThe victory against Warzena raised the Ataghan to the apex of their power among the tribes, and Mekiouzza was raised to become their leader as well as the new Aguellid - the chosen leader with the right to call the tribes to war - in recognition of her triumphs. While not officially the leader of Tobuck, the city and its surroundings knew who they relied on for protection and therefore allowed her great say in their affairs too.\n\nEver since, Mekiouzza has worked to bring Tobuck and the imazeeb together into one, united nation akin to Colthage or Maregypt, and though the events of recent years have set her life's goal back by decades, she is nothing if not tenacious. \n\n§YPortrait By§!:Kajko and Venva"
