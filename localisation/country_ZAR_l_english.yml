 ZAR_tutor_Umalez: "Find a Tutor For Umalez"
 ZAR_tutor_Umalez_desc: "Princess Umalez, or Star of Peace in Tamazight, is the current heir to the throne; but she is young and inexperienced, still laden with an almost childlike innocence. In the interest of helping her grow into an effective and learned leader, Queen Aguellid has sought for a tutor to guide the Princess' education."
 
 ZAR_send_for_Menes: "Send for Menes"
 ZAR_send_for_Menes_desc: "Menes is a Tobuckian who represents both the merchant class, and a Zarantian-friendly faction in our Western neighbor; aswell as being somewhat of a middleman between Tobuck's Peashooter and one of our own advisors by the name of Wiwurgh. The first step towards either cooperating with or reclaiming Tobuck is reaching out to Menes."

 ZAR_review_troops: "Review the Troops"
 ZAR_review_troops_desc: ""
 
 ZAR_colthaginian_contracts: "Search for Colthaginian Contracts"
 ZAR_colthaginian_contracts_desc: "Mobilizing the disparate locals of Zarantia into a modern fighting force would make for both an expensive and time consuming endevour; buying out Colthaginian Mercenaries would give us an influx of experienced troops much faster, leaving our own people to focus on internal development and construction."
 
 ZAR_prepare_mercenaries: "Prepare the Mercenaries"
 ZAR_prepare_mercenaries_desc: "With the contracts sourced and the pay settled, it is now onto us to prepare our fresh legions of Colthaginian mercenaries; primarily with exercises under Zarantian generals, educating them on the local terrain, and making sure their equipment is up to the task of modern warfighting."
 
 ZAR_refurbish_walls: "Refurbish the Walls"
 ZAR_refurbish_walls_desc: "Many of our city and border walls are in disrepair; either plagued with structural faults, antiquated fighting positions, or even completely collapsed in some places. While not of much use to the modern army, with a bit of labor these could transition from pitiful artifacts to impenetrable fortifications."
 
 ZAR_send_messengers_to_outposts: "Send Messengers to the Outposts"
 ZAR_send_messengers_to_outposts_desc: "A large number of outposts dedicated to both guarding the border and strategic areas of interest exist within our borders. Due to general negligence on the part of military staffers, these outposts are wildly out of standardisation with eachother. Equipping messengers with new orders and instructions on what a regulation outpost should look like is the first step towards fixing this."
 
 ZAR_prepare_welcome_festivities: "Prepare Welcome Festivities"
 ZAR_prepare_welcome_festivities_desc: "For any local peoples, it can be both a strange and frightening concept to let in herds of foreign soldiers to your cities and to staff your garrison. The same can be said for the incoming mercenaries, who are sometimes treated like an occupying force instead of a protecting one. To Remedy this divide between peoples, we will organize wide-scale and lavish festivals all in the name of the two parties mingling."
 
 
 ZAR_welcome_back_troops: "Welcome back the Troops" 
 ZAR_welcome_Back_troops_desc: "However it was achieved, Zarantia is now a nation with a bolstered and ready military force; this development will usher in a new era and safety for the Zaratian people in an increasingly dangerous and volatile world. What's the finest way to celebrate? A holiday, of course! Military parades and marches have been planned in all major cities and townships, and Zebras across Zarantia have the day off."
 
 ZAR_securing_land: "Securing the Land"
 ZAR_securing_land_desc: "If we wish to raise a military from the local population, we must first establish that we do infact have dominion over them. Construction of government offices and police stations in faraway townships will remind the people of Zarantia who their sovereign really is."
 
 ZAR_aguellid_speech: "Aguellid's Speech"
 ZAR_aguellid_speech_desc: ""
 
 ZAR_organize_war_feast: "Organize a War Feast"
 ZAR_organize_war_feast_desc: "The War Feast is a traditional Zarantian gathering of able bodied zebras and retired warriors from all across the land, it is a time at which elders can tell stories of glory and prestige won in their hayday to crowds of awe-inspired farmers and workers. It is a challenging endevour to ask a Zebra to die for his country, but if he truly believes it will give him purpose, and immortalize his name? He will beg you for a chance to."
 
 ZAR_raid_rebel_tribes: "Raid Rebel Tribes"
 ZAR_raid_rebel_tribes_desc: "Rebellous tribes of Zebras have been a thorn in the side of Zaranthia for generations now. Raiding supply caravans, pillaging farms, stealing villagers into slavery; it's high time we did something about it, and conducted raids on their hideouts, homes, and gatherings."
 
 ZAR_escort_caravans: "Escort the Caravans"
 ZAR_escort_caravans_desc: "Caravans are the lifeblood for much of Zarantia, they keep materials flowing to workshops, trade flowing to and from ports, and food in supply for the less agricultirually inclined townships. We would be remiss not to assign atleast some of our manpower towards protecting these critical parts of our infrastructure." 
 
 ZAR_record_favors_from_villages_and_tribes: "Record Favors from Villages and Tribes"
 ZAR_record_favors_from_villages_and_tribes_desc: "In more autonomous parts of Zarantia, there has long been an unspoken system of favors between tribal elders and government officials. With all the work going into these secluded population centers, we should start cataloging our deeds done for them, incase they ever need reminding of how much they truly owe us."
 
 ZAR_review_treasury: "Review the Treasury"
 ZAR_review_treasury_desc: ""
 
 ZAR_focus_on_settled_tribes: "Focus on the Settled Tribes"
 ZAR_focus_on_settled_tribes_desc: "Settled tribes are our bread and butter. We have only so much time and money to spend on the vast peoples in our lands, so we should obviously focus it into the more familiar villages and tribes that have settled down into permanent homes and feed themselves on organized agriculture. Nomadism is a way of the past, and sustaining it will only deprive more deserving, modern peoples."
 
 ZAR_focus_on_nomads: "Focus on the Nomads"
 ZAR_focus_on_nomads_desc: "The Nomadic peoples that make their homes (Even if just seasonally) inside the borders of Zarantia have for a long time remained elusive and hard to keep track of, but with a bit of investment we can surely make them feel welcome, and act productive."
 
 ZAR_visit_desert_allies: "Visit our Desert Allies" 
 ZAR_visit_desert_allies_desc: "Despite the obvious differences in lifestyle, the Zarantian government enjoys a very good relationship with many bands of Zebharan nomads. Sending a few Zebras of note to negotiate with and check up on these trusted friends would surely be to both of our benefit."
 
 ZAR_recruit_promising_soldiers: "Recruit Promising Soldiers" 
 ZAR_recruit_promising_soldiers_desc: "The life of a Nomad is by no means an easy one. Between the constant traveling, hunting, and fighting off raiders the average nomad nears the height of Zebrican endurance and Willpower. These make them an obvious choice for soldiering, especially when combined with their extensive understanding of local terrain and other Nomadic groups."
 
 ZAR_repair_the_wells: "Repair the Wells"
 ZAR_repair_the_wells_desc: "It can be very challenging for a Nomadic group to maintain good stocks of water, which is why many years ago they paid the Zarantian throne to commission many wells at outposts far away from natural watering holes. These have since fallen into repair and our friends have suffered for it. We should repair this, if not as a point of principle, just to show them that their woes are not forgotten."
 
 ZAR_distribute_livestock: "Distribute Livestock"
 ZAR_distribute_livestock_desc: "Pack animals and milkable livestock are the lifeblood of any nomadic horde, and as such we should offer surplus livestock animals as gifts to Nomadic tribes in order to build favor and goodwill with them. While not much cost for us, it will build a lifetime of trust for the people that survive off these cherished creatures."
 
 ZAR_purchase_slaves: "Purchase Slaves"
 ZAR_purchase_slaves_desc: "Between the Warring tribes native to Zebrica, and the many invading forces that hold little regard for the natives they encounter, the continent enjoys a healthy slave market; even if frowned upon in many circles, it is no trouble at all to buy them in bulk. We have no good reason to deprive ourselves of such a varied and diverse workforce, especially at such stellar prices." 
 
 ZAR_participate_in_city_fairs: "Participate in City Fairs"
 ZAR_participate_in_city_fairs_desc: "City Fairs a large part of Zarantian culture, they remove you from the drudgery of labor and leave you in a world of fun games, good drink, and warm food; We should ensure that every local fair has a bit of government money and a few representatives pushed their way, this will certainly paint our administration as cultured, fun, and caring."
 
 ZAR_send_help_for_harvest: "Send Help for Harvests"
 ZAR_send_help_for_harvest_desc: "The field can be a fickle and unpredictable thing; sometimes it is untenable and barren, other times it is overflowing with crops and overwhelming the usually small staff of farmers that tend to it. With a little redistribution of labor, we can help the urban poor find jobs tending and harvesting fields in places which simply do not have enough Zebrapower."
 
 ZAR_recruit_local_expertise: "Recruit the Local Expertise" 
 ZAR_recruit_local_expertise_desc: "There are a variety of benefits to living the settled life, the specialization of work being the most notable of them. City based guilds produce and train skilled craftsmen fit for all walks of life, many of them could be enticed to work for us if we guarantee them an apprenticeship."
 
 ZAR_restock_Aghzat_granaries: "Restock the Aghzat Granaries"
 ZAR_restock_Aghzat_granaries_desc: "The Great Aghzat Granaries of old were once the greastest tool a king or queen would have against the ever-present threat of famine. Many decades have made us complacent however, and the stockpile has slowly dribbled down to nothing but old, spoiling wheat. It would be prudent to take a more proactive stance on this, aswell as siphoning off a percentage of grain production towards restocking Aghzat."
 
 ZAR_taxes_and_tribute: "Taxes and Tributes"
 ZAR_taxes_and_tribute_desc: "Whether they be settled city dwellers, or elusive nomads; all people within our borders are Zarantian, they live safely and benefit from our achievements and investments. It is only fair that we collect from them one of the few universal constants: Taxes."
