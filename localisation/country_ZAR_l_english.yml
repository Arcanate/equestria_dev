 zarantia.10.a:0 "Steel and bone, fire and blood"
 
 zarantia.11.t:0 "A Route Through the Great Desert"
 zarantia.11.d:0 "Much of the tribes' wealth was built not on warfare, but on trade. For centuries, the Zebhara has been the fastest route to cross the continent, but there are few who have been able to brave the sand ocean. The Imazeeb are among those who have the strength, the skill and the willpower to conquer this desolate region, and from Maregypt to Colthage, merchants have eagerly hired their services to help speed them along their way.\n\nIn the wake of the Storm King's rampage, the caravans that once trekked these dangerous routes have all but disappeared, yet the flow of and desire for commerce has not abated, and there are those who long for the routes to open again. Tobuck might currently be lost to us, but our services are still desired elsewhere." #Zarantia used to be an important route for the trans-zebharan trade, and though it was kinda in shambles after the storm king, it's time to get it going again.
 zarantia.11.a:0 "Once more into the great emptiness."
 
 zarantia.12.t:0 "Returning from the Desert"  
 zarantia.12.d:0 " #the caravan returns, and profits are up " 
 zarantia.12.a:0 "We know these lands, and reap the benefits"

 zarantia.13.t:0 "The Desert Flowering."
 zarantia.13.d:0 "The Zonicians believe that we love the desert. We don't. We endure the desert, but we do not love it. There is nothing in the desert and no zebra needs nothing. We love the rivers that briefly flows through our lands in the winter. We love the times that the rain brings the desert alive with countless flowers and plants, and we love the fields that bring plentiful harvests of sweet fruits and filling grains.\n\nThe Zonicians have lived so long along their verdant coastlines, where the soil provides all that they could dream of, that when they see us eking out a living in the zebhara, they presume it must be a matter of desire rather than necessity. As we carve the wadis and the dried riverbeds into canals and reservoirs, treasuring every drop we are given, we remember Tobuck, that city between the rivers. There, the coastline was ours, and the ponies we liberated from their Warzenan oppressors were our friends. We traded, we feasted together, found love with each other and worked together to build a future together.\n\nTobuck might be lost to us, at least for now, but as we wait to regain that city, we wait, and we carve the desert to give what little it can." #Zarantia might be born in the desert, but they don't really like it. Taking Tobuck was more than just economy, it was a way to get away from the desert. Still, they have managed to make a living in it, and that's cool. 
 zarantia.13.a:0 "We have not forgotten you, pony friends."

### Old Focus Tree, kept because I am anxious about deleting things ###
# 
# ZAR_the_meeting: "The Meeting"
# ZAR_the_meeting_desc: "In the hushed backrooms of the Zarantian Palace, Queen Mekiouzza and the intermediary Menes discuss the future of Tobuck, attempting to strike out a deal that will satisfy the #Queen without ending in total war."
# 
# ZAR_tutor_Umalez: "Find a Tutor For Umalez"
# ZAR_tutor_Umalez_desc: "Princess Umalez is the current heir to the throne; but she is young and inexperienced, still laden with an almost childlike innocence. In the interest of helping her grow into an effective and learned leader, Queen Mekiouzza has sought for a tutor to guide the Princess' education."
#
# ZAR_send_for_Menes: "Send for Menes"
# ZAR_send_for_Menes_desc: "Menes is a Tobuckian who represents both the merchant class, and a Zarantian-friendly faction in our Western neighbor; aswell as being somewhat of a middlepony between Tobuck's Peashooter and one of our own advisors by the name of Wiwurgh. The first step towards either cooperating with or reclaiming Tobuck is reaching out to Menes."
#
# ZAR_summit_of_tribes: "The Summit of Tribes"
# ZAR_summit_of_tribes_desc: "Zarantia is only in so many ways a true "state"; it functions much more like a federation with the Queen being it's head and sovereign, whilst still lacking much authority over the many autonomous tribes throughout it's borders. In the interest of keeping the bonds between them strong, the Queen has called a summit to renew oaths of loyalty, distribute gifts, and settle petty differences."
# 
# ZAR_review_troops: "Review the Troops"
# ZAR_review_troops_desc: "The Queen has taken it upon herself to inspect the condition of the military; what she finds is a well disciplined and capable force, but with a waning loyality, and wary view of the Queens intentions and capabilities. Atleast none of them were bold enough to say it to her face."
# 
# ZAR_colthaginian_contracts: "Search for Colthaginian Contracts"
# ZAR_colthaginian_contracts_desc: "With the current throne feeling strapped for cash and needing to secure it's territory, it has been decided that we should bank our defense and security on a system of strongpoints; Walls around cities, and outposts in towns and strategically important areas. This could prove risky, but it would allow us to continue the longstanding tradition of contracting mercenaries to Colthage for money. "
# 
# ZAR_prepare_mercenaries: "Prepare the Mercenaries"
# ZAR_prepare_mercenaries_desc: "With the contracts sourced and the pay settled, it is now onto us to prepare our fresh legions mercenaries for operations in Colthage; primarily with exercises under Colthaginian generals, educating them on the local terrain, and making sure their equipment is up to the task of modern warfighting."
 
# ZAR_refurbish_walls: "Refurbish the Walls"
# ZAR_refurbish_walls_desc: "Many of our city and border walls are in disrepair; either plagued with structural faults, antiquated fighting positions, or even completely collapsed in some places. While not of much use to the modern army, with a bit of labor these could transition from pitiful artifacts to impenetrable fortifications."
 
# ZAR_send_messengers_to_outposts: "Send Messengers to the Outposts"
# ZAR_send_messengers_to_outposts_desc: "A large number of outposts dedicated to both guarding the border and strategic areas of interest exist within our borders. Due to general negligence on the part of military staffers, these outposts are wildly out of standardization with eachother. Equipping messengers with new orders and instructions on what a regulation outpost should look like is the first step towards fixing this."
 
# ZAR_prepare_welcome_festivities: "Prepare Welcome Festivities"
# ZAR_prepare_welcome_festivities_desc: "It won't be long now before our soldiers return home from their expeditions into foreign territory; as a way to boost the morale of our returning warriors and to display to our citizens the great successes and riches they've found in foreign lands, we will begin preparations for grand festivities, to celebrate their triumph and welcome them home."
 
# ZAR_welcome_back_troops: "Welcome back the Troops" 
# ZAR_welcome_back_troops_desc: "With grizzled Zebras coming home from either mercenary work or patrolling our territories, today marks the day at which the Queen's Plan for the nation finally pays off. With the homeland secured and safe again, we enter a new age of prosperity. Military parades and marches have been planned in all major cities and townships, with Zebras across Zarantia having the day off."
 
# ZAR_securing_land: "Securing the Land"
# ZAR_securing_land_desc: "Though it is an immensely profitable notion, sending our best and strongest away to foreign lands when our own so desperately need security is a far too risky plan of action; Instead, our military will be mostly kept at home to keep the reigns tight on would be rebels and bandits."
 
# ZAR_aguellid_speech: "The Aguellid's Speech"
# ZAR_aguellid_speech_desc: "With a plan for the future drawn up and soldiers across the country mobilizing, Queen Mekiouzza prepares to orate a rousing speech about what hardships will come, and the great rewards these brave few will reap."
 
# ZAR_organize_war_feast: "Organize a War Feast"
# ZAR_organize_war_feast_desc: "The War Feast is a traditional Zarantian gathering of elder zebras and retired warriors from across the land, it's a time at which elders can tell stories of glory and prestige won in their hayday to crowds of awe-inspired farmers and workers. It is a challenging endevour to ask a Zebra to die for his country, but if he truly believes it will give him purpose, and immortalize his name? He will beg you for a chance to."
 
# ZAR_raid_rebel_tribes: "Raid Rebel Tribes"
# ZAR_raid_rebel_tribes_desc: "Rebellious tribes of Zebras have been a thorn in the side of Zarantia for generations now. Raiding supply caravans, pillaging farms, stealing villagers into slavery; it's high time we did something about it, and conducted raids on their hideouts, homes, and gatherings."
 
# ZAR_escort_caravans: "Escort the Caravans"
# ZAR_escort_caravans_desc: "Caravans are the lifeblood for much of Zarantia, they keep materials flowing to workshops, trade flowing to and from ports, and food in supply for the less agricultirually inclined townships. We would be remiss not to assign atleast some of our manpower towards protecting these critical parts of our infrastructure." 
 
# ZAR_record_favors_from_villages_and_tribes: "Record Favors from Villages and Tribes"
# ZAR_record_favors_from_villages_and_tribes_desc: "In more autonomous parts of Zarantia, there has long been an unspoken system of favors between tribal elders and government officials. With all the work going into these secluded population centers, we should start cataloging our deeds done for them, incase they ever need reminding of how much they truly owe us."
 
# ZAR_review_treasury: "Review the Treasury"
# ZAR_review_treasury_desc: "With the watchful eyes of advisors and bean-counters, the Queen learns that the state of the Treasury is disparate at best. With barely enough funding to run and improve the kingdom, much will need to be done if she wishes to expand her borders and increase Zarantian productivity."
 
# ZAR_focus_on_settled_tribes: "Focus on the Settled Tribes"
# ZAR_focus_on_settled_tribes_desc: "Settled tribes are our bread and butter. We have only so much time and money to spend on the vast peoples in our lands, so we should obviously focus it into the more familiar villages and tribes that have settled down into permanent homes and feed themselves on organized agriculture. Nomadism is a way of the past, and sustaining it will only deprive more deserving, modern peoples."
 
# ZAR_focus_on_nomads: "Focus on the Nomads"
# ZAR_focus_on_nomads_desc: "The Nomadic peoples that make their homes (Even if just seasonally) inside the borders of Zarantia have for a long time remained elusive and hard to keep track of, but with a bit of investment we can surely make them feel welcome, and act productive."
 
# ZAR_visit_desert_allies: "Visit our Desert Allies" 
# ZAR_visit_desert_allies_desc: "Despite the obvious differences in lifestyle, the Zarantian government enjoys a very good relationship with many bands of Zebharan nomads. Sending a few Zebras of note to negotiate with and check up on these trusted friends would surely be to both of our benefit."
 
# ZAR_recruit_promising_soldiers: "Recruit Promising Soldiers" 
# ZAR_recruit_promising_soldiers_desc: "The life of a Nomad is by no means an easy one. Between the constant traveling, hunting, and fighting off raiders the average nomad nears the height of Zebrican endurance and Willpower. These make them an obvious choice for soldiering, especially when combined with their extensive understanding of local terrain and other Nomadic groups."
 
# ZAR_repair_the_wells: "Repair the Wells"
# ZAR_repair_the_wells_desc: "It can be very challenging for a Nomadic group to maintain good stocks of water, which is why many years ago they paid the Zarantian throne to commission many wells at outposts far away from natural watering holes. These have since fallen into repair and our friends have suffered for it. We should repair this, if not as a point of principle, just to show them that their woes are not forgotten."
 
# ZAR_distribute_livestock: "Distribute Livestock"
# ZAR_distribute_livestock_desc: "Pack animals and milkable livestock are the lifeblood of any nomadic horde, and as such we should offer surplus livestock animals as gifts to Nomadic tribes in order to build favor and goodwill with them. While not much cost for us, it will build a lifetime of trust for the people that survive off these cherished creatures."
 
# ZAR_purchase_slaves: "Purchase Educated Slaves"
# ZAR_purchase_slaves_desc: "Between the tribes native to Zebrica, and the many invading forces with little regard for the natives they encounter, the continent enjoys a healthy slave market; even if frowned upon in many circles, slaves are bought and sold in nearly every city in Zebrica. Amongst these are a few well educated types, with promises of freedom and a new life in Zarantia, they'd be more than happy to work for us." 
 
# ZAR_participate_in_city_fairs: "Participate in City Fairs"
# ZAR_participate_in_city_fairs_desc: "City fairs are a large part of Zarantian culture, they remove workers from the drudgery of labor and leave them in a world of fun games, good drink, and warm food; We should ensure that every local fair has a bit of government money and a few representatives in the mix, this way we can facilitate the trade of luxury goods and amenities to these celebrations, raking in mountains of taxes as a result."
 
# ZAR_send_help_for_harvest: "Send Help for Harvests"
# ZAR_send_help_for_harvest_desc: "The field can be a fickle and unpredictable thing; sometimes it is untenable and barren, other times it is overflowing with crops and overwhelming the usually small staff of farmers that tend to it. With a little redistribution of labor, we can help the urban poor find jobs tending and harvesting fields in places which simply do not have enough Zebrapower."
 
# ZAR_recruit_local_expertise: "Recruit the Local Expertise" 
# ZAR_recruit_local_expertise_desc: "There are a variety of benefits to living the settled life, the specialization of work being the most notable of them. City based guilds produce and train skilled craftsmen fit for all walks of life, many of them could be enticed to work for us if we guarantee them an apprenticeship."
 
# ZAR_restock_Aghzat_granaries: "Restock the Aghzat Granaries"
# ZAR_restock_Aghzat_granaries_desc: "The Great Aghzat Granaries of old were once the greastest tool a king or queen would have against the ever-present threat of famine. Many decades have made us complacent however, and the stockpile has slowly dribbled down to nothing but old, spoiling wheat. It would be prudent to take a more proactive stance on this, aswell as siphoning off a percentage of grain production towards restocking Aghzat."
 
# ZAR_taxes_and_tribute: "Taxes and Tributes"
# ZAR_taxes_and_tribute_desc: "Whether they be settled city dwellers, or elusive nomads; all people within our borders are Zarantian, they live safely and benefit from our achievements and investments. It is only fair that we collect from them one of the few universal constants: Taxes."
