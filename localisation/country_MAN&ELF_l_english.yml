LYSIA_DESC:0 "Trained at the prestigious Vesalipolis Military Academy, Lysia was nevertheless relegated to administrative duties working on the Queen's General Staff during the Great War against Equestria. Whilst her classmates achieved glory for the Changeling Lands on the battlefield, she was stuck in Vesalipolis kowtowing to Chrysalis. Her service to the Queen seemed to have paid off, though, as she was bestowed the title of Protectress over the exalted metropolis of Manehattan following its conquest."
LYSIA_GENERAL_DESC:0 "Trained at the prestigious Vesalipolis Military Academy, Lysia served on the Queen's General Staff during the Great War against Equestria. As the Protectress of Manehattan, Lysia finally has the chance to command her own army on the field in the absence of a native officer corps. Her officer's uniform may not be as glamourous as the ceremonial evening gowns befitting her rank of Protectress, but on campaign with her troops is where Lysia feels most at home."

Evacuated from Canterlot during the Great War, he found work at the Manehattan Polytechnic only to be displaced once more following the Changeling Administration's crackdown on intellectual freedom.\n\nAs part of the E.L.F. leadership, his scholarly knowledge is now put to to good use in the pursuit of a free Equestria."

ELF_coloratura:0 "Coloratura"
ELF_coloratura_desc:0 "Refusing to perform for the Changeling occupiers in Manehattan, Coloratura soon found her career as a showmare untenable, as every theatre she approached closed their doors to the pony who had the audacity to snub their new overlords.\n\nAngry and thoroughly pissed-off, one thing led to another and soon Coloratura, the darling of all Equestria, was the ELF's most infamous figurehead, her radical underground performances becoming a potent embodiment of popular discontent against Changeling rule."

Like so many other civilian members of the ELF leadership, Tall Order found his particular set of skills - in this case, a keen mind for crunching numbers - immensely valuable to the ELF war effort.

The Changeling administration of the [MAN.GetName] shall commandeer the entirety of its 77 floors as its headquarters that will house the Protectorate's military, intelligence, and administrative operations."
MAN_beginning_3a:0 "Smash the Resistance"

MAN_beginning_3b:0 "Groom the Collaborationists"
MAN_beginning_3b_desc:0 "Conquering is the easy part. Adminstration is the truly difficult task. With the empire's borders expanding so rapidly, we will need toadies to shore up our thin ranks."
MAN_beginning_1_1:0 "Our Tenuous Grasp"
MAN_beginning_1_1_desc:0 "Manehattan may not be in open revolt, but it is not a cowed city. The ponies here are uncooperative at best and actively swindle and sabotage us at worst. Lysia's hold on power is not terribly strong."
MAN_second_wing_1:0 "Building Bridges?"
MAN_second_wing_1_desc:0 "To build bridges between the Protectors and the 'Protected', Lysia has mandated the reconstruction of Manehattan's pride and joy - the Brooklyn Bridge, damaged during the fall of the city. She hopes this will make the locals a bit more compliant."
MAN_second_wing_2a:0 "Pursue Urban Renewal "
MAN_second_wing_2a_desc:0 "Protectress Lysia has a dream of a Manehattan that is neither Equestrian nor Changeling, but both. Or at least one that's fun and peaceful. To that end, its time to start cleaning up all these war torn ghettos, evicting their squatter populations to allow for eventual Changeling settlement. We're cleaning up the city!"
MAN_second_wing_2b:0 "Retool the Maneway"
MAN_second_wing_2b_desc:0 "The iconic Maneway network is the vital infrastructure that knits Manehattan together, and under the pretense of repairing its battle-damaged lines, we will retool it to be an efficient means of dispatching our security forces all across the city - artillery, panzers, and all. Reports of pony resistance cells operating from within the Maneway's sprawling subterranean tunnels are unsubstantiated."
MAN_second_wing_3a:0 "A Changeling Tax Haven"
MAN_second_wing_3a_desc:0 "Hoping to ingratiate herself not only with the rich Changeling moguls in Vesalipolis, but with Manehattan's native upper class as well, Protectress Lysia has made her city something of a tax haven. She hopes when the time comes, she can trust on them to cut her good deals."
MAN_second_wing_3b:0 "The Gears of Progress"

MAN_second_wing_4_1_desc:0 "The city cannot depend solely on supply and business from overland. It has always looked outwards to the wine dark oceans and it must do so again. But first, the ports must be repaired and repurposed for civilian use again."
MAN_second_wing_5:0 "The Manehattan Culturefest"
MAN_second_wing_5_desc:0 "At the Manehattan Concert Hall, newly renovated to suit Changeling architectural tastes, the Manehattan Sinfonietta shall perform alongside guest musicians from the Soryth Philharmonic Orchestra in a display of cross-species unity and cooperation, with the legendary Trimmel himself being on the official guest list. Reports of supposed pony mischief aimed at disrupting the concert are unsubstantiated."
MAN_second_wing_6a:0 "Shipping Routes to the Eastern Continent"
MAN_second_wing_6a_desc:0 "During peacetime a common pactice of Equestrian industrialists was trade with the Griffon continent, in which they could make a significant amount of money in the markets to the east. We should co-opt this policy for ourselves, though we may need to put some armor on our trade ships to prevent them being attacked..."
MAN_second_wing_6b:0 "The Eastern Bulwark"
MAN_second_wing_6b_desc:0 "As they grow stronger, the treacherous powers of Griffonia eye our Empire with growing suspicion. The fortification of our eastern seaboard is in order to protect the Hegemony against a seaborne invasion from the east. With time, resources, and ingenuity, we shall make Manehattan into the Changeling bulwark against Griffonia. "
MAN_army_1:0 "The Eastern Garrison"
MAN_army_1_desc:0 "The garrison provided to Manehattan was relatively small for how many ponies it was supposed to control, but Lysia's officers are making do with what little they have. It is time to assess our forces."
MAN_army_2a:0 "New Training Regimen"
MAN_army_2a_desc:0 "The first order of business is fixing the training regimen for our soldiers. Our traditional doctrines pre-suppose open ground and lots of room for manuever. We no longer have these luxuries and must adapt."
MAN_army_2b:0 "Hunters within the Concrete Jungle"
MAN_army_2b_desc:0 "The Protectorate's soldier must be more than a rifleling. They must become like the ancient Changelings and hunt like a true predator. In the urban environment of Manehattan, we do not fight rebels. Amongst the concrete jungle of our new capitol, we hunt them and we put them down, like the ferals they are."
MAN_army_3a:0 "Chemical Warfare, Urbanised"
MAN_army_3a_desc:0 "The applied research on chemical warfare performed by the Royal Changeling Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defence was a huge boon to the Changeling war effort against Equestria. With all the resources and laboratories of Manehattan at our disposal, we should invite some of their experts to help develop new methods of chemical warfare suited to urban environments."
MAN_army_3b:0 "Weapons from the Motherland"
MAN_army_3b_desc:0 "It's all coming up Manehattan! The Protectorate is due to receive a large shipment of munitions by Queen Chrysalis' grace."
MAN_army_4:0 "Weaponised Lachrymation"
MAN_army_4_desc:0 "Changelings have always been about speed and numbers on the battlefield, but in Manehattan we do things differently. The Royal Army researched into chemical warfare, but we will push even further. The development of a special sort of anti-riot gas shall aid our commanders and soldiers greately in their task to pacify and govern over the restless ponies of Manehattan."
MAN_army_4_1:0 "The New Blood"
MAN_army_4_1_desc:0 "Since we are building up the [MAN.GetName]'s military from scratch, we will have to start recruiting officers for our High Command as well. Lysia has drawn up a list of friends and colleagues from her time serving on the Queen's General Staff, and we will start headhunting them to serve as generals in our autonomous high command - the Ost-Kommando."
MAN_army_5:0 "Gas-Mask Masquerade"
MAN_army_5_desc:0 "In order to show off the strength of the Manehattan garrison, we should hold a highly publicised event in the capital where we can show off our new equipment we recieved from the queen. What we show off... well that's yet to be determined. Dignitaries from the Changeling Lands, Trimmel himself amongst them, will be present. Lysia will be happy to see her friends."
MAN_army_6b:0 "A Native Panzerkorps"
MAN_army_6b_desc:0 "It took a little convincing, but after consulting the numbers even the staunchest of our officers agree. We need more soldiers to cover the Protectorate's large territory, and to do that not only we are going to need local levies, but also a hard core of armoured units to crush any organised resistance. To this end General Dairyn has come to Manehattan, bringing with him his panzers to bolster our forces."
MAN_army_6a:0 "Urban Redoubts"
MAN_army_6a_desc:0 "As we clean up the city, our engineering drones have also rebuilt some formerly-useless structures into small fortresses within which a platoon or so of Changelings can be comfortably housed. For safety, of course. We envision that such fortifications be present in every population centre of note, so as to better enshrine the presence of our garrisons all over the Protectorate."
MAN_beginning_2_1:0 "Forays into Menticide"
MAN_beginning_2_1_desc:0 "It seems that entirely by accident, a rumor has begun to spread amongst the high-value prisoners in our jails. This rumor details how we have tactics to get into ponies' heads and control them to give up information and do our bidding. While this is not entirely true, this reputation can help us..."
MAN_beginning_4a:0 "Auxiliary Battalions"
MAN_beginning_4a_desc:0 "Any good army needs special bodies of armed 'lings - and as it seems now, pony auxiliaries - suited for tasks the average platoon simply cannot do well. Recon, construction, siegeworks, you name it."
MAN_beginning_4b:0 "Business as Usual"
MAN_beginning_4b_desc:0 "What's good for the Protectorate is what's good for you! Or that's what they say. Keep your head down, pay your dues, bring in the cash. The Protectorate smiles on the industrious. Especially if the industrious are Changeling corporations, in which case they get to enjoy minimum government oversight, zero taxation, and lucrative business contracts! To the victor goes the spoils."
MAN_beginning_4c:0 "Institutionalise the Constabulary"
MAN_beginning_4c_desc:0 "Law and Order is starting to become a problem. We've told Protectress Lysia, but honestly she seemed kind of... hungover? She's hoofpicked one of her pony cronies to be in charge of the collaborationist Constabulary, who will immediately set about recruiting and arming Changeling-loyal pony paramilitaries."
MAN_beginning_4d:0 "The Winged Order for National Salvation"
MAN_beginning_4d_desc:0 "It needs not be remarked that the peculiar bewinged pegasi are, amongst the Three Tribes, a people most naturally predisposed towards authoritarianism. The former Wonderbolts officer and establishment figure Wind Rider shall join us, commanding the pegasi collaborationists of the Winged Order for National Salvation."
UNUSED:0 "Centralise the Collaboration"
UNUSED_desc:0 "We've got a whole network of informants and collaborators, but right now a lot of them are in six dozen disorganized file boxes of notes. Lysia pawns organzing the ponies off to her least favorite aide."
MAN_beginning_2a:0 "The Manehattan Office of Public Safety"
MAN_beginning_2a_desc:0 "As much as she tries to spin it as a good thing, Protectress Lysia knows that there's just no way to make getting every pony in town registered and listed sounds fun, or non-threatening. Enter the MOoPS! Responsible for protecting the citizens of Manehattan, from themselves and each other." 
MAN_beginning_2b:0 "Silence the Academia"
MAN_beginning_2b_desc:0 "The Manehattan Intelligensia are obnoxious, as they were before our arrival. But now they're starting to turn their gaze on us, holding talks and potentially even aiding the Harmonic Resistance. Which doesn't exist, for the record. Either way, the city's academic establishment need to be taught some discipline."
MAN_beginning_2c:0 "Negotiate the Love Tax"
MAN_beginning_2c_desc:0 "It's simple, really. Changelings need love to survive. Ponies make love just, like, automatically. Ponies also don't want the Protectorate to bother them much. Think of your day-per-month as a kind of donation. But maintaining the strict quotas for Love imposed on us from Vesalipolis takes up a lot of our ponypower and resources, so Lysia will get Queen Chrysalis to revamp the taxation system."
MAN_beginning_2d:0 "The Economic Frontier"
MAN_beginning_2d_desc:0 "Changeling economics is based on Changeling culture and lifestyle, but these things have gone straight out the window in the territories. All the territories are experimenting, and Manehattan is no exception."
MAN_beginning_2e:0 "The MOoPS Department of Neuroscience"
MAN_beginning_2e_desc:0 "Hypothetically, if we *could* read your brain, which we can't, we of course wouldn't find anything incriminating. Right? Of course not. We're all friends here. Anyways, we've gotten our hooves on some new pyschoanalysis tech, and we'll trial them on some pony scientists under our protection! In the name of science, of course. They'll understand."
MAN_beginning_2f:0 "Internal Passport Plan"
MAN_beginning_2f_desc:0 "Passports! They get you places! What is the next borough over but a small country with its own vibrant culture and also tightly controlled access points and borders? It's very orderly, at least."
MAN_beginning_2g:0 "Hearts and Minds"
MAN_beginning_2g_desc:0 "Lysia thinks of herself as a Changeling of the people. Ponies. Whatever. Perhaps making the ponies fear us less will result in a more malleable populace to govern. We'll test this concept out with "Hug a Changeling" day."
MAN_beginning_2h:0 "Rewriting History"
MAN_beginning_2h_desc:0 "In the beginning, wicked alicorns came down from on high to do battle for the cities of the plain, and smote many a pony. They laid a terrible curse on all ponykind, one not lifted until recently by a beautiful Queen. The revised official historical narratives might take some time getting familiar with, but we're sure the ponies will manage. And what better way to test that knowledge than through a game show?"
MAN_beginning_2i:0 "Indoctrination Program"
MAN_beginning_2i_desc:0 "How much of the indoctrination's success is real, and how much of it is a cyncial fakery to get through the day? And does it even matter? Who knows! Praise Chrysalis."
MAN_beginning_2j:0 "Instate Military Law"
MAN_beginning_2j_desc:0 "While martial law in some form has been the norm in Manehattan for as long as we've been here, it is only now that we have codified it into a more reasonable and sustainable form. Just as well, because we're going to have to set a whole lot of new legal precedents for a prickly court case."
MAN_beginning_2k:0 "Conscript the Scientists"
MAN_beginning_2k_desc:0 "A scientist is a soldier in the army of progress! Terrible slogan, but also exactly what our new programs believe. The old eggheads are the new R&D, and we've provided swanky living and clean labs for a lifetime."
MAN_beginning_4e:0 "Amp Up Military Production"
MAN_beginning_4e_desc:0 "To build up a larger force drawn from Changeling settlers and pony collaborators means more guns. We need to ramp up production in order to supply ourselves, but also to be an arsenal for all of the hives if need be. Protectress Lysia believes that an inspection of collaborator-run military factories is in order to make sure our quotas are being fulfilled."
UNUSED:0 "Reorganise the Manehattan Police"
UNUSED_desc:0 "As fun as direct rule by hoofboot is, it isn't very stable. To that end, the Manehattan PD lives again, this time quite firmly in the service of the Protectorate government."
MAN_beginning_4f:0 "The Inkognito-Division"
MAN_beginning_4f_desc:0 "The best and/or worst thing about Changelings is their ability to be anything, anyone, and anywhere. They are natural infiltrators, and even more natural sabatouers and spies. This preternatural ability served us well in the war, and shall serve us well in our victory. Commander Soryn, who in the war had led one of our best infiltrator divisions, has come to share with us her expertise - and she's bringing her boys along too."
MAN_beginning_5a:0 "Break their Codes"
MAN_beginning_5a_desc:0 "Even as we firmly deny the existence of the E.L.F., we have struggled to break their airtight security for far too long. We must make progress. Recent inroads in the military application of cryptology has allowed us to detect and interpret coded ELF radio transmissions. It is time to see if our intel is correct."
MAN_beginning_5b:0 "The Spyeye Program"
MAN_beginning_5b_desc:0 "In true Changeling fashion, we have created the next evolution in state surveillance. The concept of an all-seeing, omniscient security apparatus is truly the best idea we could have ever asked for, and we did in fact explicitly ask for it. Smile for the camera."
MAN_beginning_5c:0 "The Resistance is Us"
MAN_beginning_5c_desc:0 "It is time to activate our deepest agent in the resistance. He is in so deep, in fact, that we have lost contact with him, but we retain the secret protocols that will bring him out of his guise. With rumors of a major resistance gathering to try and coordinate greater efforts against us, we can only hope he knows what to do."
MAN_beginning_5d:0 "For Your Own Good"
MAN_beginning_5d_desc:0 "As any state should, ours exists for the good of our citizens, mainly the Changeling ones but eh. With this, we must make all of our citizens know that the penalties imposed by military law are all there to protect them. We make the most considerable efforts to protect them from: terrible resistance terrorists, other assorted pony filth, and anything else! All it requires is a gun, and your cooperation."
MAN_beginning_5e:0 "A Surveillance State"
MAN_beginning_5e_desc:0 "Control is a holistic thing. To have total control, you must first know everything. Every step, every thought, and every action the subject takes must rest firmly in the frog of your hoof."
MAN_beginning_5f:0 "Horse Tranquilizers"
MAN_beginning_5f_desc:0 "Isn't all this fuss and discontent so... tiring? Relax. Have some water! Your compliance is mandatory, but its also beneficial. Our burden is easy, and our yoke is always light."
MAN_beginning_6:0 "Character Assassination"
MAN_beginning_6_desc:0 "For too long the ponies have seen their Princess as some godly being who wished to do only good! We must reveal her for what she truly is! A despot who would crush all dissent by making people believe she was a god above all mortal harm. Well. Our armies proved that wrong. But as long as ponies revere the memory of Celestia and her rule, they'll always be unhappy under our yoke. Let's change the narrative a bit."
MAN_third_eye_1:0 "The Collaborationist Regime"
MAN_third_eye_1_desc:"One lesson of war is that rats with no escape will fight just as hard as lions. That is, perhaps, a lesson we could apply on the bloody battlefield of PR! Introducing the Bilateral Commission for the Betterment of Manehattan. Our way of both proving further to the ponies that we *can* work together, while also rewarding loyal collaborators for their...  efforts? Obedience. Smile for the cameras!"

MAN_third_eye_3c:0 "Lady Lysia's Court"
MAN_third_eye_3c_desc:0 "Perhaps Celestia's open courts were amongst her more ridiculous ideas. Or, perhaps she was onto something. Lady Lysia seems to think the latter. After all, it would make currying favor with Manehattan's elite and prominent awfully easy. As such, beginning quite shortly, the Protectress will hear her collaborators in a weekly court at the Crystaller building."
MAN_third_eye_3d:0 "Operation Häuten"
MAN_third_eye_2:0 "A Free Ost-Kommando!"
MAN_third_eye_2_desc:"Our friends, the bureaucrats from Vesalipolis, have certainly been... helpful. Too stiflingly 'helpful', perhaps. Given that we've more than outgrown the need for their watchful eye, we think it's about time they were escorted home. For their own good, and more importantly, the good of all Manehattan."
MAN_third_eye_3e:0 "A Veterans' Haven"
MAN_third_eye_3e_desc:"Given that our Vesalipolis advisors aren't anymore, we're in the market for some in-house help. Luckily for us, our old friends, family and comrades, all seasoned veterans of the Great War, would be more than happy to help us... Should the appropriate incentive be offered, of course. Lysia herself can name a few already."
MAN_third_eye_3j:0 "Soldiers in the Factories"
MAN_third_eye_3j_desc:"Although the end of the war brought opportunities to many, many more hit a dead end. Were we to reach out to such changelings, we're certain we could make an arrangement which benefits us both. After all, our soldiers need more guns, and we can't rely on Vesalipolis to take care of us forever. For the Protectorate to be capable of standing alone, its factories need bodies."

Hard data on the V.F.D.'s history and influence is scant, but from what we know, the Vigintivirate is a powerful organisation with roots in Equestria stretching back centuries.

MAN_civil_war_2b_desc:0 "His snivelling sycophancy might have allowed him to keep his job as a commander of the airforce under the Changeling regime, but Lysia has decided that she has had enough of Cloud Strafer's obsequious pony and has had him shot for not doing his job.

MAN_civil_war_3b:0 "Buckle up Buttercup!"
MAN_civil_war_3b_desc:0 "Lysia understands the importance of a fighting-fit soldiery. This is the calm before the storm, and like a caring mother, she sees to it that her Changelings are well-cared for before their day of reckoning.\n\nJust kidding, she drills her soldiers so hard that its like boot camp all over again.

MAN_ELF.1800.t:0 "The Manehattan Protectorate"
MAN_ELF.1800.d:0 "Equestria is over. The Changelings have won.\n\nFor the ponies, shock begins to shift into a more passive bleak helplessness. The war was horrifying and costly, and now it has ended in defeat. The whole of Equestria rocks back on its heels.\n\nThe victorious but over-extended changelings begin carving up their new territories into governates and protectorates, hoping to organize a new government swiftly before the malaise can become resentment. The Queendom is expanding, but for the moment, Chrysalis has extended to the breaking point of her reach.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBy Royal Charter of Her Majesty Queen Chrysalis, we have decided to create a new administrative entity centred around the city of Manehattan.\n\nFor this tremendous responsibility, the Queen has chosen a bug named Lysia, who, despite scoring high in her class at our military academies, has been relegated to administrative work for a long time, albeit on the Queen's General Staff. Such prior experience shall serve her well, though, as she will be given command over the Protectorate to be established in that region.\n\nManehattan's new 'Protectress' has few resources, fewer allies, and the meanest city in all of Equestria to tame. The question now is... will you go with her, Commander?"

MAN_ELF.1205.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Early this morning citizens of the Protectorate Manehattan awoke to the sounds of screams and gunfire as pony resistance elements took to the streets in running battles with Changeling and Collaborationist forces in what is now considered to be mass spontaneous civil unrest in regions across the Protectorate. This eruption of seditious activity on such a large scale is alleged to be the first coordinated effort by the so-called "Harmonic Resistance" active on the eastern Equestrian seaboard. Hitherto unsubstantiated reports coming from sources in the Changeling administration allege that the "Harmonic Resistance" is in fact led by none other than the ponies known as "Starlight Glimmer" and "Trixie Lulamoon" - the former the progenitor of the failed ideology dubbed "Equalism", and the latter a washed-out street magician. Additional reporting to follow as further details emerge."

Most importantly, the fact that we were still able, unprepared as we had been, to put down the unrest meant that the legitimacy of our governance over the Protectorate was still uncontested thus far.\n\nWe may have weathered the storm today, but the reports of our infiltrator agents in the field point towards a rising trend in anti-Changeling, pro-Harmonic, and secessionist thought amongst the general population of the Protectorate. Similar waves of unrest akin to what happened in the [MAN_uprising_in_state_event_target.GetName] region are certainties that we are sure to experience in the coming months.\n\nWe must stand against the tide and protect the Motherland from the pony rabble that would seek to destroy the hard-earned fruits of our conquest."

The assessment of the extent of the damage caused to our administration is still in process, but it is undeniable that on a local level, the legitimacy of the Changeling mandate over the [MAN.GetName] has been dealt a severe blow by our failure to put down the unrest.\n\nIn post-unrest [MAN_uprising_in_state_event_target.GetName], it is being reported that civilian ponies are flaunting the 9p.m. curfew with impunity, the local Collaborationists are facing regular harassment and intimidation, petty offenses against the Changeling garrison has increased dozenfold, and, most terrifyingly, from the reports of our infiltrator agents in the field, anti-Changeling, pro-Harmonic, and secessionist sentiments have experienced exponential, uninhibited growth.\n\nIn essence, Changeling authority over the [MAN_uprising_in_state_event_target.GetName] region has been crippled.

MAN_ELF.2.t:0 "The Changelings' Manehattan Nucleus"
MAN_ELF.2.d:0 "The time has come to begin entrenching our control over our protectorate, and we have much to do. A first step is to acquire a base of operations that can support the undertaking of control over the great city of Manehattan. To that end, we have enlisted 84 Crystal Avenue to serve as our "nexus". Built during an economic boom during the recent era of prosperity in Equestria before our great war of conquest, it will serve us well in the times to come.\n\nOnce a proud symbol of Equestrian achievement, the tower now bustles with busy changelings. Orderlies carry stacks of paper past bored guards, their guns firmly in their grasp. Dignitaries visiting from Vesalipolis and engineers from Vraks on tours pass pony workers with downcast eyes and careful steps.\n\nEquestria is over. The Protectorate of Manehattan is now.\n\nThe city's new ruling Protectress is one Lysia, newly minted from the hive military academies. While universally acknowledged as intelligent and capable, she is extremely displeased with her assignment and anyone who has seen her knows it.\n\nA small party of well-dressed ponies arrive asking for an audience with the new Protectress, and she is about to pass them off to an orderly when they offer something naive yet interesting. Leading citizens, businessponies, and former civil servants have banded together to offer their services to the new regime. Her advisors scoff at the idea of pony collaborators, but Lysia treats them with a touch less derision, wondering if they might not be useful in the short term.\n\nThere is but one issue...\n\nAnd it is, of course, the ponies. The few allies we have made since our occupation began are all clamoring to work in this building, and some are even asking to live here!? Some in Lysia's staff are clamoring for the administration of the Protectorate to be a solely Changeling venture. Of course, everything in the building will be highly classified, and so it would be a severe risk to allow them to live there. But it could allow us to make nice with a few more locals."
MAN_ELF.2.a:0 "Who do those equinoids think they are!?"
MAN_ELF.2.b:0 "Alright, we'll help them move in."

MAN_ELF.3.t:0 "The Bridleway Parade"
MAN_ELF.3.d:0 "The Changeling Administration has organised a parade, as much as a show of force as a morale booster for the Garrison's personnel. Changelings march row on row down the world-famous Manehattan Bridleway, their impeccable lock-step a reminder of just how fragmentary and defeated the ponies are.\n\nIt's an impressive sight, to be sure, and your average pony is impressed. But there are a few weaknesses obvious to any more experienced observers. The garrison is lighter-equipped than it should be, and supply lines are over-burdened with the task of establishing control over such a vast prize as Equestria. The fearsome Changeling panzers are scarce, and the soldiers are not the brightly polished grenadiers of years past.\n\nStill, for all of that, the parade has its desired effect. The ponies of Manehattan know who their new masters are."
MAN_ELF.3.a:0 "Our Victory Resonating for a Thousand Years!"

MAN_ELF.4.t:0 "Rebuilding the Bronclyn Bridge"
MAN_ELF.4.d:0 "In order for the Protectorate government to have any legitimacy with the people we must try to make ammends with them in one way or another. Protectress Lysia may not be thrilled to rot away behind a desk in Manehattan, but she's not an idiot. If she doesn't shape this city and the surrounding towns into shape, this house of cards is falling on her head specifically. So! Rebuilding it is.\n\nOne proposal is the rebuilding of the famous Bronclyn bridge in Manehattan that took a severe battering when the victorious Changeling army occupied the city. On this issue two competing factions vie for supremacy; our more ardent militarists call for the demolition of what remains of the old bridge in favour of a wholly new edifice, built in the Changeling architectural tradition as an ode to our victory. The moderate (and perhaps more sensible) faction wishes to limit the construction work to a conservative restoration of the bridge to its original pre-war appearance.\n\nLysia needs to give the ponies and what not of Manehattan fewer reasons to fight back. Inviting the Collaborators into government has helped with this, as have curbing some of the behavior of her officers. But rebuilding the famous Bronclyn bridge is sure to make even the more resentful little equinoids pause when considering rebellion. The bridge will also signal a return to business as usual, with access to the city restored to the outside world. We can only hope that with the rebuilding, that this great metropolis on the frontiers of the Hegemony will be peaceful soon."
MAN_ELF.4.a:0 "The rebuilt bridge shall be an ode to the splendor of the Changeling Race."
MAN_ELF.4.b:0 "We need the support of the populace; just repair the damage and leave it as is."

MAN_ELF.5.t:0 "Too much paperwork!"
MAN_ELF.5.d:0 "Dominion is more theory than fact until you inhabit the land, or at least that's what Vesalipolis has decided. Queen Chrysalis has dispatched settlers across the continent, and after pulling a few strings, Protectress Lysia has secured a few thousand settlers for Manehattan.\n\nUnfortunately, this does mean that we'll have to expend some resources and time preparing living space for them. Some old tenement buildings and decrepit corner stores are going to be razed to make way for sensible, sturdy Changeling-style hive-blocks.\n\nWith our occupation of Manehattan we aquired its large population and significant industrial base, but we have also inherited all of its issues. Foremost of said issues is the crowded urban environment and restive slums of the city. The Protectress has initiated plans to redevelop the inner city, clearing out the slums and creating new neighbourhoods for Changeling settlement and industrial development.\n\nThe plan, though suitably ambitious, seems highly unfeasible at the moment. With our garrison overstretched and wholly incapable of pacifying dissent and unrest in Equestria's largest city, some of our officers have suggested enlisting the help of the pony collaborationists in our attempt to remake the city in our own image."

MAN_ELF.7.d:0 "Part of conquest is counting and repurposing the spoils of war. It's just the natural course of action after victory to take what you've won! Our garrison dispatched several detachments to do just that, with jaegers knocking on doors to announce new management. While those who will soon be in our employ have not had much to say, which is proper, the old proprietors have been rather heated about the whole affair. Namely, the board of governors of the East Coast Chamber of Commerce, who, in addition to being highly influential in the city's finance sector, are also trying hard to retain their independence under the new regime.\n\nWere they not ponies, and not a conquered people, Lysia might have been concerned. As it was, they are both. And yet… she thinks to the collaborators who offered to smooth her way in this sprawling city. Perhaps making some exceptions now will net us benefits in the future."

MAN_ELF.8.t:0 "[GetDateText] - The Maneway Is Bombed"
MAN_ELF.8.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Terror and chaos rule as ponies and changelings alike are caught in massive explosions along the Maneway. In the midst of repairs, Manehattan's revitalized and rebuilt main drag has been torn to shreds.Lysia is furious, and more than that completely baffled. What was the point? Why do this? She had rebuilt it for them! She had done these ungrateful ponies a favor and they had repaid her with bombs.\n\nOn the streets, her officers struggle to restore order and keep ponies off the street. In their gilded offices and boardrooms, the pony collaborators discuss how they will respond. And in the middle of it all, the Protectress of Manehattan decides what is to be done."
MAN_ELF.8.a:0 "We will have an emergency meeting."

MAN_ELF.9.t:0 "Inspecting the Garrison"
MAN_ELF.9.d:0 "In light of her difficulties, Lysia has called for aid from the empire while working to strengthen her control over Manehattan. The collaborators must be organized, the military districts rationalized, the chain of command straightened out and strengthened. But more than any of that, Lysia has a lackluster garrison to handle.\n\nThe Manehattan garrison isn't the dregs, but they are understrength and without much armor. The biggest problem now is numbers. For all of their superior firepower and training, the Changeling garrison just does not have the numbers to hold back a true insurrection with an organized core. The Ost-Kommando has suggested lowering their training standards temporarily to raise a large force capable of watching everyone and everything.\n\nAlternatively, a selection of Lysia's officers put forth a proposal to double down on Changeling strengths, focusing on hitting hard and fast with elite and highly mobile forces. A large army of half-trained fools may be able to sit and watch everything, but feeding and paying them will be a drain on our resources. Better to have a smaller force that can respond quickly and effectively at a moment's notice."

MAN_ELF.11.d:0 "The authority of the Protectorate is challegened at every turn, and so we must endeavour to change that. Using tried and true tactics, we believe he best way to do that is to ensure no one is left alive who would challenge us. Changeling Intelligence is to compile a blacklist of all known and suspected dissidents residing in the Protectorate for surveillance, detainment, or elimination.\n\nNow it is past midnight, and the lights on the top floor of the Crystaller Tower are on. Lysia's aides chitter and murmur over half-eaten food and piles of paper, throwing names at each other and making snap decisions. Sapphire Starlight? Irrelevant. Haberdasher Silver? Too marginal. Seraph Scales? Alright, put her on the stack.\n\nLysia, deciding to do more than rule from a distance, puts her staff to work compiling a list of the city's top minds. The artists, the poets, the analysts, the scholars, the socialites, the gregarious rich, the veterans, even the pop stars are sorted into piles. Some are useless and not worth the energy. Some are too dangerous, and need to be marginalized, shamed, or intimidated. Arranged before these busy drones lies a constellation of ponies the regime finds potentially useful, ponies to be courted for their influence and offered deals and jobs to secure their grudging loyalty."
MAN_ELF.11.a:0 "It's all coming up Lysia."

MAN_ELF.12.t:0 "Lysia's visit to the Manehattan Polytechnic"
MAN_ELF.12.d:0 "As quoted from Queen Chrysalis herself: "The smart ones are always the first to cause trouble".\n\nAnd so Protectress Lysia planned to end that problem before it can even begin.\n\nLate last night, squads of Changelings jaegers from across the Protectorate gathered on street corners and alleyways in the middle of downtown Manehattan. Normally such an important operation would be touted and hinted at by our propagandists in order to drive up fear and anxiety, as a form of pyschological warfare. This operation, however, would be all dark.\n\nThe Manehattan Polytechnic institute was a focal point for engineering, the sciences, and higher education in general in the city, but its main campus building, open to the public, served little academic use, and the historic structure was instead rumoured to be a hotbed of Resistance activity.\n\nThis would be ended fast. Under the cover of darkness, the jaegers approached on all sides and placed barrels of kerrosine oil all along the outside of the building. Then, Lysia herself, an engineer by training, short-circuited the electrical system and set it all alight. The fire department arrived but it was too late. The symbol of learning under Celestial rule was gone. Reduced to atoms.\n\nIn all honesty, Lysia didn't really have that much concrete evidence that the campus building was indeed a hotbed of resistance activity. But she had faith in her rumours, and at any rate it was better to be safe than sorry."
MAN_ELF.12.a:0 "What else did Chrysalis say? Ah yes, "I am Inevitable"."

MAN_ELF.13.t:0 "Dinner at the Crystaller Building"
MAN_ELF.13.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Charm and glitter abound at the Crystaller Building tonight, as the Lady Protectress of Manehattan entertains the wealthy and powerful of the city with a lavish dinner party at Changeling headquarters. The Protectress was reported to be highly active at the dinner, moving between tables wining and dining with her guests. Amongst them were big names such as fashionista Suri Polomare and former Wonderbolt Wind Rider, both of whom have publicly voiced their support for the new regime.\n\nA guest at the party who wishes to remain unnamed said that "Everything was great - the food, the wine, the conversation. Lysia strikes me as an ASTUTE LEADER ha ha, though I wish her fangs weren't so sharp."\n\nReporting for Vesalipolis news, Zanx Sorhia."

MAN_ELF.14.d:0 "Changeling arts have not been widely embraced or celebrated away from the hives. So it was with some surprise that the ponies of Manehattan discover that Changelings actually have a long and varied tradition of art music. Selections from Georg Fredric Chitindel and Amadeus Chrysalidus fill the city's music halls and for the first time warble out from old turntable speakers. And it's good!\n\nLysia invites some of the Hegemony's finest musicians to Manehattan, and some of the best of Manehattan's music scene to collaborate together in a concert at Carneighie Hall for the city's edification. Ticket sales are through the roof, and for the first time in a long time ponies and changelings alike are genuinely excited about something despite themselves."

Loose masonry and dust kicked up by the explosion peppers the terrified crowd as Lysia and her staff are swiftly evacuated. Changeling sentries in elaborate dress uniform shield the musicians as they flee back behind the stage, and there is gunfire that later no one can place.\n\nThe whole city is thrown into chaos, with rumors flying that the Protectress was killed or that the shadowy leaders of Manehattan's fledgling rebel faction were caught in their own blast. Stories that ELF partisans have taken several neighborhoods threatens to become reality as panicked and emotional ponies rush to secure their homes and the safety of their loved ones. Soldiers are paralyzed as their commanders find their lines of communication cut. A mob of ponies trample down a Changeling officer in the theatre and a half dozen civilians are gunned down as they try to force their way into the streets.\n\nLysia, her chitin cracked from a stray piece of shrapnel, brushes the blood from her eyes and tells her guards to find her a phone.

Furious soldiers find troublemakers, ponies who sometimes just look a bit rough, the neighborhood tousled-headed youth who needs to learn when to shut his mouth, and begin shooting. Only a few dozen die, but the effect is immediate. The shooting of one or two silences whole blocks as the riotous rabble realizes that, no, they aren't ready to face the changelings outside.\n\nLysia acts in anger, but also out of a strange sort of heartbreak. She regrets the reports. She knows that they didn't catch those responsible. But it doesn't matter. She does what she needs to do. Isn't she a better sort of ruler, really the ally of these poor, stupid ponies? Or something? What was the point of all of this? What was she going to do?"

Tonight is no different... except that tonight, the MOoPS is about to finally catch its elusive prey.\n\nUsing Celestial cypher machines from the great war, resistance groups have maintained the ability to encrypt their messages to a high quality that has been difficult for even our codebreakers to deal with. But with the advent of new decryption technology from scientists in the cold north of the continent, we believe we have discovered a way to figure out the source of a transmission without even needing to know what it says. Triangulated radio signals, a fully parsed code, even brief infiltrations have all confirmed the location of a single source from which many of the resistance transmissions around Manehattan stem, and our soldiers now prepared to move in.\n\nThe location is a seemingly unthreatening cabin in the forests outside of the city. The security is light by our standards, with no guards at all and a very simple magical ward to keep sound from leaking out of the room. Could it be this easy?\n\nThe jaegers that have moved in at night are ordered to bring it down. Tear gas shells are fired, flashbangs are set off and the compound falls like a wet paper bag.\n\nAlmost literally.\n\nWhen our units reached the inside they found only three unarmed ponies and a high-powered radio.\n\nAfter some investigation, it turned out that the messages we had been trying to break were just complete and utter gargle, and this station's only goal was to just keep putting out nonsense. Now we can consider this a victory, as we can still show off these captives and their radio. But we also found more information about other cells, though we can only pursue one course of action, as those cells will surely grow suspicious and relocate if this radio goes dark for too long."

This was supposed to be a quick and easy trip - her assistants would find which factory had the best performance and she would go there, say how great they were doing, praise the Queen and get it over with.\n\nBut someone made a wrong choice.\n\nBecause when the Protectress showed up at the factory, she was fired on by Resistance members, but not in large enough numbers that they could have been expecting her, though.\n\nNo, this unfortunate encounter seemed to have happened purely by chance. After her guards subdued the factory, the irony of the situation revealed itself. The factory WAS undeed extremely productivem and many of the workers there were sympathetic to the new regime, as they had been former collaborationists who the Resistance had captured and coerced into working in this factory.\n\nNow comes a choice for Lysia. The Garrison can either seize control of the new industry and operate it directly, or turn it over the these newly-liberated collaborationists and reinforce the loyalty of her "allies" in Manehattan."

Bribes that he's almost inclined to take, considering that sparing many of the least offensive collaborator-run manufactories might be best in the long run for productivity. Even the workers in the worst mills feared Changeling overseers running their workplaces directly.\n\nFor that matter, if he painted too dire a picture, would they do something drastic?"

With this we should make a show out of this as much as possible. Lysia has arranged for grenade fireworks and rocket barrages! Just a lot of explosives, really.\n\nCome twilight a few hours later, and the Crystaller Building is all aglow with a gathering of Manehattan's finest and most important Changelings. Manehattan has seen hundreds and hundreds of balls over the years, but perhaps none like this: a Masque of, well, Gas-Masks. Every Changeling attending the festivities sports some kind of gas mask, spruced up in gaudy and often macabre ways. After all, it is under the aegis of the Lady Protectress that the frontier of chemical warfare is ever being pushed fowards within Manehattan's laboratories, and everypony in attendance knows it. So novel is the night that Trimmel himself is in attendance!\n\nThis carnivalesque spectacle is a great entertainment for Lysia's generals, who take the opportunity to indulge in drunkenness and shocking the few pony guests and workers. The night is a success as far as its hosts are concerned, but stories from the pony waitstaff filter down into the city.\n\nTrimmel, highly drunk, makes a promise to a similarly-intoxicatede Lysia.

When there are no consequences and no one can stop you, petty vandalism loses its appeal fast.\n\nThe distant sounds of police sirens catches both of their attention.

No one ordered it, and there are no targets. Middle-level officers start organizing their commands into defensive positions, and Lysia's generals lock the city down. Search parties are dispatched in every borough looking for terrorists fleeing the scene of some hitherto-unlocated bombing.

And everywhere the Spyeye slogan appears in big, bold, red: "THE INNOCENT HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR", ringing loud and clear what serving the state can give you.\n\nSome posters and grafitti are just baffling. The slogans are vague or just openly sinister, the imagery frankly unkind. Questions directed to the collaborationist government return a dozen different answers, all contradictory, and all of them official. Cameras watch ponies in the street. Cameras watch other cameras. Ponies watch each other and no one is watching Lysia except when she wants everyone to be watching her.\n\nThere was only one issue with Spyeye.\n\nIt doesn't exist.\n\nThe whole thing is an elaborate propaganda stunt made to show some progress to the Main Hive of progress that has been made against the Resistance.\n\nThe truth is that Spyeye is part surveilance system and part propaganda drive. The "real" material part of the program is merely an extreme stepping up of surveilance in public and private spaces. The true meat of the program is a massive, almost impossible to grasp system of chaos, misdirection, misinformation, and constant paranoia.\n\nAnd yet, it ended up working.

And they couldn't let that happen. They could now only hope for whatever their commanding officer had planned to succeed.\n\nGeneral Vesper, Special Operative of the Protectorate Security Division. It was him that the soldiers were trusting with the plan to conquer the building, and so he had to put everything he could into not letting them know that in fact, he really had no idea what to do either. He had simply told them to keep observing and wait. He figured that, once inside, he would come up with something resembling a plan, somehow, eventually.\n\nAs the dissident ponies gathered within the building, one who seemed to be their leader stepped onto the make-shift podium against the wall of the broken building and began to speak...\n\n"Hello fellow members of the Resistance!"\n\n"Tonight we have gathered to plot our greatest action yet against the buggers who wish to hold us down."\n\nThere is murmured acceptance from the crowd.\n\n"Now this plan is only known to a few of you here, of course, and has been in the works for a long time.

In place of the pony Resistance member was instead a grizzled-looking Changeling - a fate shared by many of the Resistance members of the audience. Caught completely off guard, the gathered Resistance broke under the chaotic onslaught of the Changeling operatives in their midst. The exits from the building had all been secured by undercover Changeling infiltrators who subdued anypony trying to flee, and in ferocious room-to-room fighting, squads of jaegers in gas masks wiped out the last Resistance holdouts in the basement and upper floors through the liberal use of tear gas.

The letter concludes with a thinly-veiled threat against any sort of separatism on the part of Lysia's regime.\n\nIt is clear that our overlords back home will not dare to intervene directly, militarily or otherwise, in the affairs of the [MAN.GetName]. They are simply too overextended dealing with the occupation of the rest of Equestria to risk the East Coast descending into civil war. That being said, Lysia has to cautiously consider her response to Chrysalis.

Her gamble had paid off; when push came to shove, her titular overlords in distant Vesalipolis had backed down. The Ost-Kommando had never been able to rely on the central government for much help, so they had always had to go it alone. Manehattan has thusly earned its autonomy through hard work and determination, Lysia reasoned as she left the meeting room. On second thought, that sentiment had seemed a bit simplistic, and besides, a higher degree of autonomy alone would hardly be the answer to the turbulent mess that was the Protectorate of Manehattan.\n\nBut still! A small victory is a victory nonetheless, and such triumphs are few and far between in the nerve-wracking grind that is the governance of the East Coast.

From Manehattan, they had boarded an armoured train which took them along the coastline, making good time to the industrialised city of Albion. Greeted by officers from the local section of the Manehattan Office of Public Safety, the entourage had taken a night to map out the surroundings, counter-referencing their research with their intelligence on the history and possible fate of the Morning Walker, gleaned from the interrogations of captured Equestrian military officials.\n\nA Vanhoover-Class battleship, the Morning Walker, as far as seized Equestrian military records indicate, was only three-quarters complete by the time the Changeling advance threatened its home port, causing it to flee north, semi-finished with a skeleton crew, where it foundered off the coast of Albion following some obscure shipboard accident. The Ost-Kommando's review of the official narrative and the subsequent skepticism towards its truthfulness led to an investigation of the battleship's true fate; if rediscovered and captured on the Ost-Kommando's own initiative, not only would the Morning Walker grant the Protectorate significant naval power, but also prove to the Hegemony that Lysia's administration was capable of providing for itself - not that Vesalipolis had ever done much to support the Protectorate either.\n\nLysia was tired, her uniform stained and muddied from the hours of continuous trekking, bushwacking through the dense undergrowth and clambering over rocky hillsides. Her muscles burned, her meticulously-groomed appearance had gradually come undone, and yet it was the most alive she'd felt for months. The sun was quickly sinking beyond the horizon as they approached a patch of flat ground bordering a small inlet, at the end of which were cliffs leading to the sea.\n\nIt was at the fringes of the grassland, where another step further would have sent her plummeting into the wave-beaten rocks, that Lysia's order to make camp was strangled in her throat, as she realised that the leafy boughs swinging from side to side beyond the cliff's edge were not trees on the opposing cliffsides, but rather, the vine-covered lattice masts of a great battleship - the Morning Walker - snugly moored inside the inlet.\n\nThe next morning, as the reinforcements she had radioed in from Albion were getting the ship seaworthy for its voyage to Manehattan, Lysia sat up outside her tent and enjoyed the sunrise over the ocean."

Well-connected with the scrawny but highly advanced military-industrial complex under the Diarchy, the scientists could be persuaded to impart to us their knowledge of Equestrian weapon systems development. On the other hoof, the report indicates the existence of a yet-unnamed military R&D project, the only details of which thus far hint at a weapon of great tactical importance.\n\nNo matter what is done with the scientists, we can be sure that choosing the first option will be beneficial to the Manehattan Garrison's hold on the Protectorate, whilst pursuing the latter will likely result in a less tangible reward, if at all."

MAN_ELF.72.t:0 "Changeling Dispatches - Patrolling the Everfree"
MAN_ELF.72.d:0 "Beyond the outskirts of Ponyville lies the Everfree Forest. Densely packed with ancient, gnarled trees hundreds of years old, in many places the undergrowth is nigh-impenetrable, leaving travellers only with the few paths through the forest that somehow manage to stay clear of foliage. The deeper one plunges into its depths, the more otherworldly the forest seems as civilisation recedes; the sun fails to pierce the opaque canopies, the treeroots on the forest floor grow so contorted it is hard not to trip, and the flora becomes so exotic and wild to be undomesticable even through earth pony magic. The shadows become thick and foreboding, and the pervading gloom makes it hard to see past a few metres. One can easily imagine getting lost in the murk, doomed to wander the forest until the end of time.\n\nNo wonder, then, that Zecora's Everfree Resistance had managed to survive as long as it did within. Not so long ago, their bloody and short-lived insurrection had surged to encompass the surrounding towns, threatening Canterlot before being forced back into the forest from whence they came. But the Everfree Resistance seemed to have an unnatural affinity with the woods of their namesake, and the Changeling divisions bled ten times as heavily clearing the forest as they did its surrounds.\n\nBut with the brute force of sheer firepower, they had managed. They burnt the trees until there were none left for the ponies to hide behind. Artillery barrages cut swathes through the undergrowth. And they had deployed so many tons of defoliant that even the Everfree began to sag under the poisonous onslaught. As the forest burned, Zecora's insurrection withered away until there was nothing left.\n\nAt least, this was the official narrative. But patrols through the forest still went missing from time to time, and already the Everfree was recovering rapidly from the damage wrought by the Changeling invasion. To be sent to this particular frontier was tantamount to a penal assignment, and everypony knew it.\n\nThis did not explain why Ocellus, a fully-fledged corps commander qualified to lead entire divisions into battle, was now trekking through the mud, leading a column of Changelings through the Everfree. It was supposed to raise morale, Lysia had said. Her aunt's apologetic demeanor suggested otherwise, implying, with a thinly-veiled rage, that higher powers in Vesalipolis had a hoof in her newest assignment.\n\nWas she merely a pawn in Lysia's power plays, then? Perhaps her assignment to such a dangerous posting was designed to punish her aunt for some esoteric transgression against the elites in Vesalipolis.\n\nFor now, it didn't matter. The front of the column has paused at some unseen obstacle. Ocellus glimpses shadowy figures flitting from tree to tree, and the murky depths of the forest begin to shift with the movements of creatures unknown. Behind her, there is an unfolding of blades as her troops affix bayonets. Ocellus pauses, and tries to gauge the nature of their soon-to-be assailants."

There are at least two dozen of them, and the largest of the pack would easily outweigh a Changeling panzer. Ocellus wonders how the Everfree Resistance managed to keep them at bay.\n\nBut fierce as they are, the timberwolves are no match for the heavy machine-guns the column deploy, and in an instant those at the forefront are torn apart by unrelenting volleys of gunfire, shredded into clouds of wood splinters and bad vibes. Ocellus directs her column's fire onto the charging timberwolves with unwavering precision, until the creatures are all dead or routed."

But by then half their number are already dead or wounded, and the remnants of the column are beset on all sides by the Everfree Resistance, of which Ocellus can only make out faint blurs as the partisans flit from tree to tree.\n\nShe picks out a partisan gunner on a treetop, half-hidden by a curtain of vines, and shoots. Past her smoking pistol she makes out the corpse of her unlucky target, falling to the ground. But there are too many of them, and the forest is the ponies' domain. They make a brave last stand at the base of a great oak tree, and their final remnants are at last cut down where they stand by unseen pony snipers.\n\nOcellus, somehow, evades the pony partisans who are butchering her soldiers, and flees into the depths of the Everfree."

It was supposed to be just a publicity bit, showing the troops that their leaders understood the view from below. But the partisans of the Everfree Resistance had hit hard them in the woods, and after bullets had sliced through her wings she had tumbled down into this ravine. And then the timberwolves came.\n\nThis one had been unlucky. When she'd killed one of its companions with a few well placed shots, the rest had fallen back, and this lone creature had lost its footing. Now it was hungry, and its presence was keeping her trapped here more surely than her broken wings.\n\nShe tried scaring it, and then ignoring it, and lastly, out of a kind of lonely grace, she offered the creature some of her rations.\n\nWhen the reinforcements finally found her two days later, that wolf was already hers."

The island's real value lies with its strategic geopolitical location, with the potential of serving as the staging point for an invasion of Griffonia.\n\nLysia and the Ost-Kommando are under no illusions as to the Griffish Isle's military value. To acquire the island would be a boon to Manehattan's power, at least on paper, anyways.\n\nVesalipolis is fully cognisant of the fragility of their rule over the occupied territories of Equestria, and should be receptive towards our proposal to take the burden of administering the Griffish Isle off their hooves.

Give them a cause or a warm, happy memory and they'll cling to it until the bitter end.\n\nIn this case, deliverance from the Changeling jackboot comes in the form of their unassailable Princess-Mother, her chaste, maternal demeanor and the profundity of her mystical powers combined in a paragon of Equestrian divinity — the pinnacle of everything a pony wants to become. That the sun still rises and sets without her guidance is immaterial to the ponies' worship of the Solar Goddess, which, if anything, has intensified under the new Changeling regime.\n\nSo long as they remember her, Celestia's very memory and existence will certainly continue to motivate them to insubordination and in time, open revolt. Lysia's new initiatives to 'educate' the populace about their old leaders' many faults may not always be factual, and the process of indoctrination will require much time and effort, but she has no doubt that it will be beneficial to the legitimacy of the new regime with time.\n\nManehattan's schools now teach young foals and changelings about Celestia the tyrant, greedy, stubborn, and myopic, a lazy delegator who pursued luxury whilst other ponies did all the work.

We are going to need to do better if we are to chip away at Celestia's personality cult.\n\nLysia's aides have proposed two alternatives to the initial plan. First of all, we could target the most controversial aspect of Celestia's reign: the undemocratic nature of the harmonic regime. It was something fringe republican movements had been complaining about for ages. We could use this to paint Celestia as a power-hungry tyrant who suppressed dissenters to preserve her autocratic rule.\n\nThere is, of course, another option. Equestria under the Diarchs was notably pacifistic, resulting in a weak military using outdated technology, something analysts often point to as one of the major causes for Equestria's defeat in the Great War. We could attack Celestia on her peaceful ways, describing them as cowardice that left the ponies undefended and helpless, while implying the Changelings' superior military would defend them from harm.\n\nHowever, some of Lysia's aides believe Celestia's reputation to be pristine to the point that any attempt to tarnish it would backfire, and have instead suggested dropping the initiative as quietly as possible with the hope that nobody will notice."

Although the group is made up of renowned industrialists, owners of private banks and otherwise unbelievably rich ponies, they all seem dazzled by the luxury on display.

From the penthouse's numerous windows and balconies, one can see the entirety of Manehattan, its lights providing an awe-inspiring view - this is the highest spot in the entire city.\n\nThe changeling general staff is already seated when the guests arrive and Lady Lysia rises in welcome to shake hooves with the ponies. The servants are hard at work, and soon enough, dinner is ready, washed down by the finest wine. Lady Lysia thoroughly entertains her guests throughout the evening by utilising her transformation magic to startle and impress. Mixed in is talk of business dealings - Lady Lysia has secured at least one major contract by the end of the night - as well as the gathering of... sensitive information, should it be required down the line. Overall, it was all in all a successful and profitable evening.\n\nWhen all is said and done, Lysia's general staff advises her to institutionalise the "court" as a sort of formal advisory council to increase her regime's legitimacy and control over Manehattan society through keeping its elites on her side.\n\nHowever, Lady Lysia is now pondering another idea. In her ambtion, she wants to take inspiration from the open court sessions from Celestia's rule, open to everypony who had an issue to take up with her.

She couldn't have been more wrong.\n\nThe grandfather clock struck twelve. Noon. She had been there since eight in the morning, and by Chrysalis, she could swear she hadn't heard a single reasonable request the entire time. It was baffling! Just how many ponies had the free time to bother her with the most unbelievably mundane issues one could imagine? Leaky pipes, troublesome neighbours... lost keys! At this point Lysia felt very sorry for Celestia who had to put up with this madness daily for more than a thousand years.\n\nThe next petitioner approaches her, but instead of belting out another 20-minute long tirade about \"noise pollution\" and \"clean water\", she pulls out a pistol from some hidden pocket in her gown. Lysia's heart lurches, and for a moment, she thinks it's all over, but her personal guard beats the aspiring assassin to the draw and volleys a cascade of bullets into her would-be killer. The pony is dead before she even hits the floor.\n\nAs is natural, the incident cuts the session short as guards escort the panicked ponies outside. Lysia stares out a window into the city outside, still trembling lightly. Had the guards been just one second late to react...\n\nBut strangely, she also felt relieved to be free of her boredom. The botched assassination attempt had been an episode of much-needed exitement in an otherwise tedious day, and the nonchalance with which she took it in stride concerned herself. The whole salon idea might have been a mistake after all. The sessions were grating on her mental health to the point where nearly getting killed seemed like an improvement.

Now that Lysia has managed to cement the Changeling presence in the city of Manehattan and its satellites, however, the elimination of the Fillydelphia and Albion resistance organisations has become the next objective of paramount importance for the Garrison.\n\nFor the past few weeks, Changeling agents undercover in pony guises have infiltrated the respective organisations of the two restive cities, keeping tabs on the actions and whereabouts of the most prominent Resistance leaders. Having been allowed to flourish, these organisations proved more resistant to infiltration, with several infiltrators being uncovered and subsequently lost, but shielded by the intensification of policing and reprisal actions by local garrisons, the operatives largely succeeded in revealing the identities of the surviving leadership of the Resistance.\n\nLysia's coup de grâce to the Albion and Fillydelphia Resistances came in the form of Operation Häuten. The nights that preceded the operation were exceedingly foggy, through the manipulations of collaborationist pegasi and Changeling magitech. The garrisons, who had exhibited such brutality in their policing of the past weeks, were strangely quiescent and docile, even as curfew-breaking Resistance members, emboldened by the obfuscating fog, engaged in petty skirmishes with Changeling checkpoints and patrols. For a while, it seemed that the suffocating mist that had descended on Fillydelphia and Albion both had revitalised the Resistance, the opaque veil of whiteness offering a cosy anonymity to dissidents and criminals alike.\n\nIn the weeks to follow, though, the ponies of the Resistance would be wishing that the dense, ephemeral fog they had grown to like would instead be replaced by the billowing clouds of Changeling tear gas deployed in Manehattan. Changeling jaegers, shrouded in riot gear and gas masks, preyed on anypony who dared stay out on the streets past the curfew. Often, the unlucky target would not see their pursuers' approach until they emerged wraith-like from the milky fog, swinging their trucheons. Plucky members of the Resistance checking in on safe houses and hideouts reported them missing their inhabitants, food half-eaten on the tables and the nebulous fog creeping in from opened windows. Ponies venturing outdoors at night courted the risk of being taken by the many Changeling snatch-squads lurking within the fog. Their families dreaded something else entirely - that something wearing the face of their loved ones would return home in their stead.\n\nNo members of the Central Resistance Committee in Albion have been seen for the past week, dead nor alive. In Fillydelphia, rumours abound of an absentee leadership clandestinely smuggled across the sea to Griffonia, leaving behind the shattered and demoralised remnants of a resistance.

MAN_ELF.95.t:0 "An Impromptu Martyr"
MAN_ELF.95.d:0 "Prior to the Great War, the anti-establishment philosopher known as "Hoofdrich Chryzsche" was a figure notorious for his radical anti-monarchist views and contrarian attitude, but not much else. Equestria's defeat and the subsequent Changeling occupation seemed to revitalise his fiery rhetoric, however, as dissident ponies living under the new Changeling regime found themselves in need of an iconic figurehead to rally around, and the eccentric, populist Hoofdrich was the ideal character to play the role.\n\nTo any critically-minded observer, the fact that he had been allowed to remain a vocal but outspoken opposition figure under the Protectress Lysia's rule, even whilst the real subversives of the Harmonic Resistance were being hunted relentlessly, seemed like an obvious indictment of his relative harmlessness in the grand scheme of things - a conveniently defanged talking head to satisfy the appetites of milquetoast dissidents.\n\nIn the end, though, whether Hoofdrich's contrarian philosophy was of any real substance became immaterial to his image. Found dead this morning at his penthouse apartment on Manehattan's Bridleway, his corpse was still warm when the mainstream dissident newspapers, accusing the Changeling regime of having assassinated the philosopher, called for a general strike and street demonstrations in his memory.\n\nThough the economic impact made by those in the workforce who had struck was decidedly minimal, by dusk there was a large congregation of ponies in downtown Bronclyn's Central Park holding vigil around a makeshift shrine for Hoofdrich, now having become a martyr of the Resistance. Nightfall saw groups of armed ponies descend on the park, forcing out the Constabulary present and erecting hasty barricades around their martyr's shrine. The flag of the [MAN.GetName] flying above the park's central plaza was torn down, symbolically defaced, and burnt, with the Equestrian royal banner raised in its place.\n\nEven then, such blatant dissent was no cause for concern to the Ost-Kommando. At daybreak, the massed ranks of Changeling troops and their Constabulary auxiliaries stationed around the park's perimeter would prepare their assault on the barricades. Panzers and artillery pieces would be brought up via the Maneway, and collaborationist scouts would erode the boundaries of the Resistance-occupied parkland. The encircled ponies readied their rifles and prepared to make a grim last stand around Hoofdrich's Shrine.\n\nAt least, this was how things were supposed to go. Instead, the few companies of Changeling soldiers around the park found themselves surrounded by massive crowds of restive ponies, drawn there by the news of an impending massacre of Resistance. The armoured reinforcements never arrived because the Maneway rails had been sabotaged overnight, and the collaborationists, upon seeing the swelling and increasingly angry masses of Manehattanites who had shown up in opposition, simply melted away.\n\nThe situation is quickly getting out of hoof as Fillydelphia and Albion convulse in sympathy riots, and if Manehattan is not pacified soon the rest of the Harmonic Resistance may well decide to further escalate the situation. Masked rioters battle with Constabulary and Changeling soldiers all over the city, and the population grows more restless by the minute.

Most prominent amongst the ships on display were the two newest additions to Manehattan's fledging navy - the Großstadt Manehattan and the Dame Protektorin.\n\nBoth former warships belonging to the Celestial Sea Fleet, they had been lost during the Great War; the former holed below the waterline by a changeling torpedo bomber and subsequently run ashore by her crew, and the latter scuttled at its moorings as Manehattan fell. Belonging to the Canterlot class of Equestrian battleships, both vessels are considered antiquated relative to contemporary designs, but the proximity of their wrecks to the megalopolis and the relative ease of recovery which this entailed made them the target of the Ost-Kommando's naval reclamation efforts.\n\nWith a startling efficiency the Großstadt Manehattan had been towed from its resting place on the shore to the dockyards of Manehattan, where it had been repaired, refitted, and recrewed, to sail the oceans once more under the flag of the Changeling Hegemony. On the other hoof, the Dame Protektorin was returned to its drydock immediately after the naval review, where work on renovating its armament and superstructure continued; a barren hulk still algae-coated and battered from being refloated scant days ago, it had barely managed to stay afloat during the naval review.\n\nAs symbols of bygone Equestrian naval might, the resurrection of these two battleships call into question the aspirations of Manehattan's Changeling administration."

But all agree afterwards that she is nothing if not a stellar hostess, and beautiful no matter what her form.\n\nAs a parlor trick, notably, Lysia shifts many times that night.

The shimmering filth that emerges from the smokestacks come in all the colours of the rainbow, rising above the landscape to blot out the sun. The pinnacles of the skyscraper-factories rival those of Canterlot in their ambition to pierce the heavens, shrouding in shadow the abject misery of the labour camps and sweatshops below.\n\nEven after nightfall, long past twilight, the foundries where magic is caged and remoulded with such brutal efficiency continue on with their ceaseless activity, their wan emanations lighting up the night sky with the glow of an eternal sunset."

Electricity crackles ominously around the brooding thunderclouds, then there is a blinding flash of light as a jagged spear of lighting - pure energy in its most primal form - lances down from the stratosphere to touch upon a distant spot on the horizon.\n\nIts target, the decrepit hulk of a wrecked Equestrian battleship several kilometers out to sea, erupts in a magnificent fireball, wowing everypony present.\n\nImpressive though its destructive potential may be, the Lightning Coil in its current form is not ready for the battlefield, but it is only the first of the many technological marvels to come forth from the laboratories of Lysia's Domain."

The soldiers at the checkpoints would check his counterfeited papers, find nothing out of the ordinary, give the back of his van a perfunctory glance, and so he would move on. The thrill of trepidation and danger from his illicit smuggling trips had long since given way to a sense of dullness.\n\nSo why did he feel so worried, now?\n\nThen the officer was leaning through the window into the driver's cab, and he was handing over his sheaf of identification documents, and he had got out of the van and was going to open the back up for the customary inspection when he felt the rifle butt smash into the back of his head. A figure leaned over him as he felt the muzzle of a pistol press against his temple.\n\n"The devil's in the details, liebchen.

MAN_ELF.117.d:0 "Today, the residents of the coastal town of Canterbury were treated to a spectacle out at sea, as the Manehattan-flagged cargo liner Terpsichoria engaged in close-range naval combat with a group of commerce raiders under the leadership of the pirate Turquoise Breeze. Having served in the Equestrian Royal Navy during the Great War, the sailor-turned-pirate has now been confirmed to be working with the Harmonic Resistance, attacking Changeling shipping off the Equestrian East Coast.\n\nRecent naval reforms undertaken by the Changeling military administration of the Manehattan Protectorate would prove to be the downfall of this notorious pirate. Recently outfitted with steel belt armour, the Terpsichoria was able to withstand the opening salvo from the attacking skiffs, and through skillful use of its shipboard ordnance, was able to sink or disable at least three pirate vessels, routing the remainder. In a devious boarding action undertaken by the Terpsichoria's small complement of jaegers, Turquoise Breeze was captured alive aboard the wreckage of his flagship and taken into Changeling custody, along with an operative of the Harmonic Resistance.\n\nSpeaking to the press, the Chief of Navy of the [MAN.GetName], [MAN_scripted_loc_for_chief_of_navy], proclaimed the demise of piracy in Manehattanite waters, and reiterated the Changeling administration's commitment to combatting the Harmonic Resistance's illegal activities, wherever they may be."

MAN_ELF.118.t:0 "An Appropriate Use of Force"
MAN_ELF.118.d:0 "In the shade of the Bronclyn Bridge, crowds of ponies throng the Mare-de-Sun Square Garden, waving banners and placards and chanting anti-Changeling slogans. Unannounced by the mainstream opposition groups and seemingly unnoticed by the Changeling administration's network of collaborationist informants, the spontaneous protest had, in a rare outmaneuvering of Lysia's MOoPS, succeeded in catching the Garrison's security apparatus completely off guard. Because the Constabulary is as ineffecient as ever, we have had to rely on our own infiltrators, performing impromptu transformations into random passersby as a consequence of their rushed deployment, to gather intelligence on this sudden outpouring of unrest.\n\nWithin the ranks of the dissenters, their purpose becomes readily evident: they have occupied the construction sites around the structs of the Bronclyn Bridge, damaging and sabotaging equipment in an apparent bid to stymie our reconstruction efforts. The destruction is chaotic and unorganised, and there is some conflict between differing factions within the dissidents as to their methodology, but the damage already being done is significant - a strain on our finances and resources, and another blow to the legitimacy of Changeling rule overe the East Coast.\n\nThe flurry of activity within the Crystaller Building, provoked by the nasty shock of the Harmonic Resistance's sudden strike, is frenetic and tinged with hysteria. It did not help that the collaborationist staff were especially susceptible to the panic, on account of them being ponies.\n\nAcross the city, the local changeling commander stationed at the Bronclyn Bridge has his own plans, as the occupation of the Square entered into its third hour. On his own initiative, in an excellent embodiment of the Changeling military tradition which emphasises snap decisionmaking and mission-type tactics, the company of soldiers under his command took up positions within the buildings surrounding the Mare-de-Sun Square Garden, and began firing volleys of tear-gas to disperse the rabble. The speediness and shock of the changeling response broke the resolve of the ponies and sent them all running, in a surprising and complete rout.\n\nUpon hearing the news, the Ost-Kommando amassed before the doors of Lysia's bedroom all breathe out a collective sigh of relief. The Lady Protectress was having her daily nap, and everyling knew how worked up she could get if she got woken up, especially to deal with random crises."

Every surface seems covered in barbed wire, fearsome anti-air cannons are mounted on the guard towers, and there are rumours that Diamond Dog jailors have been brought over from Griffonia to bolster the prison's defences.\n\nAll these preventative measures designed to counter a breakout, fearsome as they are, now seem trifling in the face of the Harmonic Resistance's most audacious feat of defiance yet - a direct assault on the Penitentiary, to rescue their commander Firefly from the bowels of the prison. A series of well-placed explosions brought down the fortified front gates and disabled the turrets on the guard towers, after which pony partisans stormed the prison, surprising the guards and taking control over most of the facility.\n\nThe surviving guards are now barricaded within a secure section of the facility with access to a pier, from which reinforcements can be inserted. A company of jaegers, backed up by a platoon or so of Constabulary officers, are now ready to reenter the Penitentiary to disrupt the Resistance operation. Firefly's cell has been blown open, and the renegade commander with his coterie of partisans are fighting his way out of a cordon of changeling guards as we speak.\n\nThe Harmonic Resistance rearguard defending the approaches to the prison may have had the element of surprise at first, but they are lightly-armed and will not stand up to a concerted push; whilst their commander may escape, we can make sure that it will cost the ponies dearly. On the other hoof, we might still be able to recapture Firefly before he makes good his escape, if we work fast enough. What shall it be?"

Most of the regular patrons are missing; become refugees displaced by the fighting, or laying low in their homes, or gone to fight with the Resistance. The basement storeroom has been turned into an impromptu bomb shelter, and inside the kitchen-turned-nursery, a harried stallion regales a group of foals with stories from a happier time.\n\nAmidst the turmoil of war, perhaps the bravest thing a pony can do is to simply carry on with normal life.\n\nFor Lysia, the Lady Protectress of Manehattan, currently a petite pegasi mare sitting alone in a bombed-out cafe, any semblance of normality had long since crumbled into dust. Her plans of a stable and prosperous Manehattan within the Changeling Hegemony had fallen through. The Equestrian east is awash in flames, as the ponies lift themselves up from under the Changeling jackboot. Even in the capitol, the fighters of the Harmonic Resistance continue their relentless war of attrition against the Garrison and the collaborationist Constabulary.\n\nThings fall apart; the centre cannot hold. Lysia's forces crumble under the pony onslaught, and from her distant masters, the spectre of direct rule from Vesalipolis looms large over what remains of her demesne.\n\nLifting her head up from the table, Lysia scrutinises the ELF recruitment poster pasted up by the door:\n\n"Long Live Equestria!/Join the Liberation!/Everypony must Do Their Part!"\n"Calling on All Soldiers & Patriots/Membership Not Required!/No Questions Asked, Amnesty for All Collaborators!"\n\nLysia knows of former collaborationists, her fair-weather friends, who had thrown in their lot with the E.L.F. and had been handsomely rewarded for their services, their past treachery momentarily forgotten. She glances down at her own body; for an infiltrator as experienced as she is, prolonged affection of the pony guise is of little difficulty. And, once safely ensconced within the ELF ranks, she can feed off the comradely feelings that will undoubtedly be in abundance.\n\nFrom her informants, Lysia hears about plenty of rumours, such as the planned rocket barrage later in the day that might or might not obliterate the top stories of the Crystaller Building; her offices and apartment.\n\nIt would be no effort at all, for a Changeling of Lysia's calibre, to play at being a devoted member of the ELF, worming her way into the decentralised pony leadership.

MAN_ELF_new.143.d:0 "All over Equestria, from Appleloosa to Vanhoover, a revolutionary calling beckons to those ponies who still stand defiant against the Changeling oppressor. Under the banner of the Equestrian Liberation Front, dissidents and ideologues of all stripes stand together, paying no heed to the doctrinal quibbles and internecine infighting that once plagued the subversive left and right alike, united in their common dream of a free Equestria.\n\nFrom Stalliongrad to New Mareland to the Riverlands, be they of the Three Tribes, or batponies, griffons, or hippogriffs, the brave fighters of the ELF have converged, from all over the world, to gather on the plains of the Equestrian East Coast. Alongside the Harmonic Resistance - now risen from the shadows - they take up arms to participate in this Liberatory Endeavour. The thirst for freedom had always burned within the hearts of the ponies living under the Changeling jackboot, and from those embers, a veritable firestorm has now erupted to scour the Queendom's black taint from Equestria's fair lands.\n\nAt the forefront stands the Duumvirate, Starlight Glimmer and Trixie Lulamoon - the matriarchs of revolution, heirs to the fallen Diarchy. But the uprising was borne not out of their visionary imaginings alone, but from the sacrifices of ponies bled and killed in the collective struggle against the invader; it is the blood, tears, and sweat of these unsung heroes that serve as the glue binding together the constituent parts of this nascent revolution.\n\nAt the dawn of what may well be Equestria's penultimate struggle, the ponies rally under a flag of the Sun and Moon combined - two symbols of Equestria united, flanked by swords drawn in their defense - in what may be the rebirth - or the final demise - of the Cradle of Ponykind."

MAN_ELF_new.148.d:0 "Verdant Flora's ears were ringing. What had she expected when she joined the ELF? She knew she would end up having to aid the cause one way or another. And indeed, here she was, part of a woefully outnumbered force, her comrades around her struggling to halt the advance of the Changeling forces. And here she wasn't, the Duumviir Trixie Lulamoon, who had for so long agitated the ponies, promised them freedom, led them on this expedition, and yet was now nowhere to be found.\n\nA certain bitterness filled Verdant's heart. What would become of her? This battle was nothing short of hopeless. Would she be remembered by her friends and family as a hero, or would she become yet another statistic of this grim war?\n\nAs the merciless changeling onslaught continued, Verdant noticed something peculiar. It was a thunderstorm cloud - a massive cumulonimbus - drifting towards them unusually quickly, leaving a trail of heavy rain on the battlefield. The changelings didn't seem to be particularly perturbed, for they were preoccupied with pushing back the ponies with cheer. Verdant sighed and braced herself for the rain. Could this day get any worse?\n\nBut the rain never came.\n\nAs the cloud drifted above the clashing soldiers, a terrible booming noise echoed from its depths, startling pony and changeling alike. Before either knew what was going on, a vibrant torrent of energy blasts and bullets exploded out from within, raining down upon the absolutely unprepared changelings. The barrage from high was unrelenting, sending the changeling units into chaos as panic spread, causing many to flee in any direction to avoid the sudden attack.\n\nThe intense torrents of magic and firepower caused the cloud to quickly dissipate, and the truth of the situation immediately became obvious: shrouded within the thick folds of the cloud were teams of unicorn mages, two to a small blimp, flanked by a screen of airborne pegasi. It was apparent that the pegasi and the unicorns had combined their weather manipulation abilities and magic to conceal themselves within the cloud to launch a surprise attack from on high.\n\nAnd, shining like a flare at the forefront, was Trixie Lulamoon herself, her horn glowing fiercely with bright blue light as the pegasus-unicorn shocktroops hovered above the battlefield, her bursts of magic taking down multiple changelings at a time. The sight was beautiful and terrifying. Trixie's voice echoed from above. \"Don't give up hope, everypony! The great and powerful Tri- no, the great and powerful Resistance can take on any challenge! We fight for our loved ones! We fight for our home! We fight for Equestria!\"\n\nThe effect on both sides' morale was remarkable. The changelings, although still vastly outnumbering the ponies, were in a sorry state as entire companies broke up in the disorder and panic. And the ponies, who had previously been the ones nearly on a brink of a rout, were now cheering Trixie's name and charging into the disrupted changeling ranks. Verdant Flora joined in the counterattack, her eyes burning with newfound hope. Before the day was over, the ponies had completely repelled the attack and the changelings had suffered an incredibly embarassing defeat."

MAN_ELF_new.150.d:0 "The staff hall in the Manehattan Polytechnic was empty. Everypony was asleep, or working late into the night on some sort of government project. Or so it should have been, were it not for the two professors arguing as they sifted over a pile of leaflets which were distributed across the Protectorate just this morning as part of a greater "awareness campaign" providing information on the short-lived regime of Daybreaker and her Solarist government.\n\n\"I recognise this data. Our very institution procured it covertly during Daybreaker's reign. There is absolutely nothing inauthentic about these leaflets - it's less than neutral in tone but the data it presents is indisputably accurate\", the younger stallion explained.\n\n\"So what, pray tell, should one do in this situation? Do you figure the Resistance should come out and condemn a unifying symbol, and thus legitimise the Changeling occupiers? Do you realise the ramifications of such an act?\", the older professor retorted, annoyance tinging his voice. This assertion only agitated the younger professor further.\n\n\"A unifying symbol, my flank! Daybreaker was a war criminal! The atrocities committed by the Solarists are unspeakable, and you suggest we should disregard them in favour of some sort of faux unity? What about justice for the victims and their families?\"\n\nThe older stallion sighed and shook his head.\"The memory of Celestia is a crucial factor to uniting the ponies under a common cause. To aid the Changelings in tarnishing her memory would help absolutely nopony. It's not that I think it's right - it's that I think it's the lesser evil. The ponies must focus on the current threat at hoof.\"\n\n\"And how are we any better than our occupiers if we surrender our values and glorify a tyrant for our own benefit? How could we stand up to them and say we fight for freedom and Equestria after defending tyranny and injustice?\"\n\n\"The time for reconciliation and exposition of the truth will come, but only after we are rid of the Changeling yoke! The difference is that we do this for the greater good, whilst the changelings are simply tyrants who will resort to all means in oppressing and exploiting us.\"\n\nThe debate continued long into the night, and in the end it ended up going in circles with no conclusion in sight. It was, after all, a very difficult question. Should the ponies stay true to their values and swallow the propaganda condemning Daybreaker, therefore legitimising the Changeling regime? Or should they steel themselves and pay no heed to the slandering of Celestia's memory - no matter how factual and indubitably evil Daybreaker's crimes had been - in order to protect the ponies' unity against Changeling rule? There was no doubt the same debate was raging within the ranks of the Resistance."
MAN_ELF_new.150.a:0 "As antithetical to our ideals as it is, we simply cannot legitimise the Changeling oppression."

MAN_ELF_new.153.d:0 "Images of apocalypse flash before Lysia's eyes. Panzers and armoured bulldozers ramming through pathetic barricades to demolish the city blocks beyond; black plumes of smoke spewing from buildings set ablaze by cannon fire; the monolithic bleakness of the refugee camps on the far outskirts of Manehattan's urban sprawl; Changeling jackboots pounding down the rubble-strewn avenues of ruined neighborhoods. The scream of klaxons ringing through empty streets of districts slated for "redevelopment", populated only by ghosts and the desperate living. The camera lingering on the bawling face of the newborn foal clutched tight in his mother's grip, before they are swept away by the tide of ponies fleeing westwards into the setting sun, away from the carnage of Manehattan.\n\nLysia is snapped out of her reverie by the dinner conversation; down the table there is raucous laughter. Amongst the guests, Lysia recognises some faces; here the Chairpony of the now-acquiescent Fillydelphia Motors, there the Chief Financial Officer from Nidhogg, and other captains of industry and wealthy magnates, all here in celebration of the Protectorate's next ambitious exercise in triumphal grandeur - the construction of a planned city named after the victorious Queen, Chrysalia, within Manehattan itself.\n\nIn the next room over, an antechamber off of the opulent dining hall, the sounds of a muted argument are slowly growing louder, over a table strewn with maps and diagrams detailing the redevelopment of Manehattan. Lysia's interest is roused; she had expected fierce backlash to the Ost-Kommando's plan to remake the megalopolis in the Changeling image, but not at the very dinner party celebrating the launch of the plan!\n\nIt is a well-dressed pony who is arguing with a Changeling. Something stirs within Lysia, as she grasps at the emerging hope that she might have to call off the redevelopment plan after all. The image of the crying foal crosses her mind's eye, and when she lets it linger, his face morphs into that of a Changeling larvae; echos of the changelings' Unification Wars. She is ridden with a growing sense of premature guilt, Lysia realises, for the atrocities she is soon to preside over in the name of progress.\n\nHer presence alone is enough to quiet her arguing guests. Now now, she says, softening the bite of her stern tone with a trace of motherliness. What do we have here?\n\nTell the pony bastard, the changeling snarls (Lysia does not know his name), that the plan is not being postponed at the whim of some moralising sap who dares to stand in the way of progress, and at this vitriol the pony rears his head in anger. Lysia expects an impassioned plea for the salvation of the districts slated for demolition, the anguish of a creature who, in the depths of capitulation, had decided to finally take a stand against the unstoppable Changeling tide.\n\nThe ramifications of enacting such a plan on the Hayston area would be unconscionably horrific, the pony says, and delight blooms within Lysia as she discovers that perhaps somepony on her staff has retained some semblance of a conscience, or sanity, or both.\n\n"We would be better off arranging for much of the redevelopment to take place in Bronclyn, by the sea, where Chrysalia would benefit from a superior geographical location."\n\nThe pony keeps on talking, citing statistics and whatnot, whilst his changeling opponent responds with mounting anger. Lysia is no longer listening, her thoughts returned to scenes of misery and desolation wrought upon the city that she had been forced to rule over, but had nonetheless become her home.\n\nThe quiet brings her back to reality. What do you think, Lady Protectress, someone asks, and through her blurred vision she can no longer tell whether it was the pony or changeling that had spoke."

With guns drawn, the Constabulary stormed the offices of their predecessor organisation; for having put up an armed resistance when the Changelings conquered Manehattan, the police force was outlawed and disbanded, with those officers who had turned themselves in sent to internment camps. The headquarters were abandoned and thus deserted, and so the collaborationists wasted no time occupying the premises, breaking into locked safes and filing cabinets, rifling through decades' worth of police records to sift through the valuable information in their pages.\n\nThe Constabulary included a few former policeponies, turncoats who had pledged their services to the new regime. At the ransacking of what had been their former sanctum, there were those who took it with a sense of apathetic detachment. For others, it signalled a break with the old, a sort of violent induction into the ranks of the New Order.\n\nA Changeling flag now occupies the space where the crest of the MCPD once adorned the face of their headquarters. The mandate of upholding Law and Order may have been adopted by the Constabulary, but whether they will ever come to replace the old police in the eyes of the ponies remains to be seen."

Safe behind such an immovable bulwark after the harrowing hours of navigating behind the Changeling lines, crawling about on our bellies our snouts in the rubble whilst bullets whistled overhead, or, before that, the bleak months spent hiding within bombed-out ruins, dodging Changeling sniper-fire during our dangerous and unrewarding food runs, I could not resist letting off a brief, exuberant laugh. As the battle for Canterlot raged all around us, I felt the most alive I've been for years.\n\nChalcedony - just Chalce to me - was hunkered down by my side. Her mane and coat were matted with grim and filth and blood. She had never looked more beautiful. In her magic she grasps a portable radio, the sort used by the operatives of the Harmonic Resistance. We had taken it off the corpse of some Changeling officer, his body leaning halfway out of his wrecked car, blown open insides all spilling out like a smashed fruit by a magic blast.\n\nAny minute now, Chalce says to me, her voice somehow carrying over the din, and as I glance up mortar rounds pass by over our heads, falling in graceful arcs into Changeling positions just out of sight. We can only enjoy a brief moment's respite from the silenced gunfire; the barrage has only bought us a small window of time before the Changelings regroup.\n\nChalce casts a protective dome around our position. We pop our heads up above the parapet, and are relieved that no bullets smack into her shield. Opposite us, across one of the many bridges that knit the mountainside districts of Canterlot together, a Changeling commander - a full-fledged Major it seems - sees us as we see him, and makes to shoot with his puny pistol. I pick him off with ease.\n\nSomewhat admirably, the small squad of Changeling sappers still remaining on the bridge keep at their task, gamely trying to set their detonator charges even as we cut them down with our withering fire. But the next volley of mortar rounds flattens their comrades to their rear, finally breaking the Changeling resolve. We jeer as they retreat in disarray.\n\nThe marble sculpture of Starswirl the Bearded that gives the bridge its name still stands tall, surrounded by a halo of the Changeling dead."

They often go without uniforms or any marking of their allegience, blending in perfectly with the populace. They were rumors once, but now they are undeniably real. Their agents firebomb our garrison outposts and make threats towards our collaborators.

The building was quickly consumed by flame, and with it the home and lives of hundreds.\n\nThe soldiers' names have not been released, and furious mobs hound the offices and garrisons of the Protectorate.
