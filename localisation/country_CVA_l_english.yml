### Focuses ###
CVA_the_revolution_has_begun:0 "The Coltvan Revolution"
CVA_the_revolution_has_begun_desc:0 "After years of struggle, we have finally taken the first step to liberating Coltva from oppression. To arms, farmers and workers of Coltva! We shall defend our autonomy to the last breath!"
CVA_the_end_of_the_junta:0 "The End Of the Revolutionary Junta"
CVA_the_end_of_the_junta_desc:0 "While the revolutionary junta allowed us to fight our long struggle, we have no intention of running a military regime like the Zarcaids did. With our autonomy secured, we can begin transitioning to a civilian government."
CVA_follow_through_with_our_promises:0 "Follow Through With The Plan Of Kizil-Zeb"
CVA_follow_through_with_our_promises_desc:0 "Our promises to the people of Coltva outlined in the Kizil-Zeb Plan represent our core commitments, and we must uphold them. We will break the oligarchs who have exploited us for so long, and the wealth they took from the people will be returned to the people."
CVA_nozebra_left_behind:0 "Not A Soul Left Behind"
CVA_nozebra_left_behind_desc:0 "How many thinkers, scientists, poets, and leaders lie dormant in Coltva, subdued by the chains of illiteracy and a neglected education system? One is too many. We must make large investments in education to free our people from intellectual poverty."
CVA_support_urban_development:0 "Cooperate With Urban Intellectual Circles"
CVA_support_urban_development_desc:0 "While the core of our movement arose out of the rural peasantry, we have always had many sympathisers among the urban intellegentsia. These new comrades will prove invaluable in governing our nation, as even a decentralised republic needs bureaucrats."
CVA_neuter_zarza:0 "Give The Butcher His Due"
CVA_neuter_zarza_desc:0 "Zarza has been undermining us from the beginning, sowing doubt and inciting sabotage among the urbanites who were skeptical of our revolution. He has no interest in honest politics, and would rather see us reconquered by the Zarcaids so he can rule as one of their political chiefs. We have more than enough evidence to have him arrested and tried; we need only act swiftly and see it done."
CVA_immortalise_the_revolution:0 "The Immortal Revolution"
CVA_immortalise_the_revolution_desc:0 "#TODO"
CVA_deradicalise_the_LAE:0 "The Good Monday Agreement"
CVA_deradicalise_the_LAE_desc:0 "The fighting is over; our oppressors have been defeated. Now we must move together and build a brighter tomorrow, rather than eternally avenging the injustices of yesterday. We will sit down with our humbled former enemies and draft a binding agreement to ensure a lasting peace."
CVA_really_modern_labour_laws:0 "Protect the Coltvan Working Class"
CVA_really_modern_labour_laws_desc:0 "The oligarchs exploited the workers through uneven laws in some areas, but in others they exploited us through the lack of laws. Ozid has proposed a robust set of labour protections so that every Coltvan will enjoy decent, meaningful work and just wages."
CVA_promote_free_trade:0 "Encourage Free Trade"
CVA_promote_free_trade_desc:0 "We have no desire to seek autarky. Indeed, it would be foolish to try in a nation as small as ours. We will forge strong trade relations with other nations to bring in new goods and improve the lives of our people."
CVA_autonomous_regions:0 "Rural Autonomism"
CVA_autonomous_regions_desc:0 "We have always held that the peasant can be trusted to govern their own community: our entire revolution was predicated on that trust we put in the common zebra. Now that the situation has stabilised, we will devolve significant autonomy to local peasant communities."
CVA_the_principle_of_federalisation:0 "Adopt the Macawian Model"
CVA_the_principle_of_federalisation_desc:0 "Without the pen, the sword would be raised in vain. We will secure the freedoms we fought so hard for by drafting a new constitution, modeled not on the oligarchic constitution of Colthage, but on that of Macawia, which has always stood as a beacon of democracy."
CVA_unban_conservative_parties:0 "The Dual Constitution System"
CVA_unban_conservative_parties_desc:0 "#TODO"
CVA_finish_the_liberation:0 "Continue the War Of Liberation"
CVA_finish_the_liberation_desc:0 "#TODO"

CVA_stick_to_the_plan:0 "Implement Land Reform"
CVA_stick_to_the_plan_desc:0 "Land reform was one of our key promises to the peasantry. We will seize land from the oligarchs who have oppressed our people for so long, and set up tribunals to determine historical land claims so that the land will be returned to its rightful owners. Then we will take one third of the land owned by the monopolists and give it and the which has no clear claimants to the landless farmers who toil upon it."
CVA_begin_primitive_industrialisation:0 "Primitive Industrialisation"
CVA_begin_primitive_industrialisation_desc:0 "Colthaginian rule has done little to improve the industrial sector of long-neglected Coltva. While we will not attempt to replicate the crash-industrialization of Stalliongrad, we will begin importing machinery and training our workers in modern industrial methods."
CVA_develop_steel_milling:0 "The Coltartan Steel Mills"
CVA_develop_steel_milling_desc:0 "Steel production is a key component of military and civilian industry alike. We will construct a vast steel mill just outside Kizil-Zeb to kickstart this vital industry."
CVA_basic_heavy_industry:0 "Subsidise Heavy Industry"
CVA_basic_heavy_industry_desc:0 "The primary purpose of the economy is to serve and provide for the people, but part of that is securing them from those who would subjugate us. We cannot always make butter: sometimes, we must make guns."
CVA_bauxite_mineing:0 "Expand the Qeshaym Bauxite Mines"
CVA_bauxite_mineing_desc:0 "Aluminum is vital for establishing advanced industries, and it fetches an excellent price on the global market. We have discovered a large source of Bauxite in the jungles around Qeshaym, long left underexploited due to squabbles among landowners. With those landowners gone, we can now properly tap into this mineral wealth."
CVA_develop_silver_mines:0 "The Silver Of Coltva"
CVA_develop_silver_mines_desc:0 "For some time, the vast silver deposits of Coltva were used to line the pockets of Zarcaid allies as part of their patronage networks. Now that this silver is under our control, we will sell it abroad to get the necessary cash influx to kickstart our economy. We must not grow overly dependent on this revenue source however: we are a nation for the workers, not a clique of silver barons."
CVA_connecting_coltva:0 "The Kizil-Zaboula-Qeshaym Railway"
CVA_connecting_coltva_desc:0 "Our communities are connected by gravel roads and the occasional stone bridge. If we are to transport our goods and connect our nation, we should build railroads in between our three major cities."
CVA_major_development:0 "Economic Shock Therapy"
CVA_major_development_desc:0 "In order to secure our economic wellbeing, we need to make massive investments in new factories, railroads, everything. For the next year, we will pour our efforts into building a modern industrial sector so that our army may be equipped with modern weaponry and our people may enjoy the comforts of modern life, even out into the most rustic countryside towns."
CVA_foreign_experts:0 "Import Foreign Industrial Experts"
CVA_foreign_experts_desc:0 "While we have some local experts, our burgeoining industrial sector requires more expertise than we currently have. We will offer generous salaries and prestigious positions to foreign architects, engineers, metallurgists, and industrial scientists who come to work here. They will train a new generation of Coltvan workers in the most modern industrial methods, and soon we will be the ones other nations look to for expertise."
CVA_textile_industry:0 "Support The Qeshaym Textile Industry"
CVA_textile_industry_desc:0 "Our textile industry has always been fairly strong, but we should further support this basic industry to provide jobs for our people and drive down the cost of clothing."
CVA_plantations_for_the_people:0 "Plantations For The People"
CVA_plantations_for_the_people_desc:0 "We are a revolution of farmers and peasants. To benefit that class which helped us the most, we will clear out new swathes of arable land to build new plantations, which will be worked and managed cooperatively by the farmers themselves. These will not be like the monoculture plantations favoured by capitalists and uncaring, distant bureaucrats: we will rely on local knowledge and crop rotation to ensure the soil remains fertile for generations to come."
CVA_increase_industrial_mobilisation:0 "Mobilise The Economy"
CVA_increase_industrial_mobilisation_desc:0 "Fighting a conventional war for the first time, the REA has found itself running low on ammunition and supplies. We must seize control of key factories and gear them towards wartime production if we are to win our freedom."
CVA_feed_the_people:0 "Cassava, Sorghum and Maize"
CVA_feed_the_people_desc:0 "Our primary concern must be feeding our people. By focusing our plantations on growing staple crops, we can ensure food is always cheap and readily available, so that our people always enjoy plentiful, nutritious food even in times of hardship."
CVA_develop_coffee_fields:0 "Coffee and Tobacco"
CVA_develop_coffee_fields_desc:0 "By focusing our plantations on cash crops, we can get a much-needed export to bring money into Coltva, which we can then reinvest in improving the lives of our people in a myriad ways. Additionally, the cooperative nature of our plantations means that the farmers themselves will take home a great deal of the profits from these cash crops."
CVA_develop_the_rubber_fields:0 "Rebuild the Rubber Plantations"
CVA_develop_the_rubber_fields_desc:0 "Our jungles contain many rubber trees which could be easily exploited to benefit our people, but thus far have remained underdeveloped. We will invest into starting a rubber industry, both for export and for domestic use."
CVA_develop_the_sugar:0 "Sugar And Rum"
CVA_develop_the_sugar_desc:0 "Some of the farmers on the new plantations have approached us, saying that introducing sugarcane into their existing crop rotation scheme will provide a valuable cash crop while not degrading the soil conditions. Several of the villages around these plantations have also expressed interest in setting up local distilleries once the sugar crop starts to come in, so that they can start up a rum industry which would bring money into these villages and prove a valuable export. We should encourage these developments."
CVA_mechanisation:0 "Agricultural Mechanisation"
CVA_mechanisation_desc:0 "We have sometimes been characterised as primitivists, or as anti-industry, but this is not so. We can and will integrate modern tools into our traditional agricultural methods. This way, we can gain the benefits of mechanised agriculture without falling prey to the unsustainability which others have embraced so carelessly."
CVA_improve_specialisation:0 "Let The Crops Flow"
CVA_improve_specialisation_desc:0 "Our agricultural expansions have borne fruit. Our common farmers are better fed and better paid than ever before. They take pride in their work and their land, and dutifully steward the soil for the next generation. Our children will grow up tall and strong, never knowing the stunting effects of lean years or the burning ache of hunger."
CVA_the_chocolate_industry:0 "The Zeirutid Chocolate"
CVA_the_chocolate_industry_desc:0 "Mechanizing agriculture and setting up our new plantations has had an unexpected benefit: between the sugar we're now growing and the cacao beans we have always harvested from the jungles, Coltva has become home to a booming chocolate industry. Encouraging this growth will both provide us with another valuable export and a delicious addition to our army rations."

CVA_the_army:0 "The Liberation Army Of the East"
CVA_the_army_desc:0 "The LAE has been fighting against our overlords for many years. Between us, we already have a great deal of knowledge of how to fight effectively and efficiently; we merely need to pool that knowledge togetherto create a doctrine."
CVA_smuggle_in_rifles:0 "Every Rifle Helps"
CVA_smuggle_in_rifles_desc:0 "When we took over the cities of Coltva, the Zarcaid forces did not withdraw in an orderly fashion. If we comb through local records, we can doubtless find numerous weapon caches and armouries which they weren't able to empty before we arrived, and turn their contents on their former owners."
CVA_local_arms_manufacturing:0 "Local Rifle Manufacturies"
CVA_local_arms_manufacturing_desc:0 "For centuries, we zebras have practiced small-scale metallurgy and weaponsmithing. Although centralised weapon manufactories are more efficient, given our present circumstances we have to rely on this tradition of local gunsmiths to bolster our weapon and ammunition supplies."
CVA_standardise_rifles:0 "Adopt the Garcano"
CVA_standardise_rifles_desc:0 "The reality is, we have no single service rifle. The LAE is a disparate force of peasants and workers, bringing what weapons they could to the struggle when they felt they had no choice but to take up arms. Still, officially adopting the Garcano rifle as our standard service rifle will streamline the process of manufacturing new weapons and equipping new units, although it could be many years before our soldiers' kits are standardised in practice."
CVA_zaboula_academy:0 "Found the Zaboula Military Academy"
CVA_zaboula_academy_desc:0 "We should gather our finest military minds together into an academy, both to train new officers and to pool together our accumulated knowledge so that we will make new breakthroughs in military doctrine, science and technology."
CVA_support_battalions:0 "Field Support Battalions"
CVA_support_battalions_desc:0 "An army doesn't just need riflezeebs. We need medics, messengers, scouts, and a myriad other support staff to wage war on the modern battlefield. Although during our days as a guerilla force, each unit had to be self-sufficient, we are now in a position to put these specialist troops into dedicated support battalions to assist our forces on a larger scale."
CVA_liberation_artillery:0 "The Cannons Of Liberation"
CVA_liberation_artillery_desc:0 "No longer constrained by what individual zebras can carry on our backs and hide in our jungle encampments, we can begin rolling out cannons, howitzers and heavy mortars to support our infantry."
CVA_raise_the_militias:0 "Stir the Peasants"
CVA_raise_the_militias_desc:0 "Though our enemies branded us as traitors and bandits, we the LAE has always been popular among the downtrodden of Coltva, with our leaders elevated to the status of folk heroes. Already, we've seen volunteers flooding into our hastily-set-up recruitment offices, wanting to join our struggle. We should send officers out into the countryside to arm, train, and organise these enthusiastic zebras into new units."
CVA_jungle_training:0 "From the Jungles We Came"
CVA_jungle_training_desc:0 "Identify the target, strike when the enemy is distracted, fade into the jungle, ambush the troops they send after us. That is how we have waged our struggle for many years, and the Zarcaids have never been able to match us as jungle fighters. We will adapt this experiential knowledge to our current larger-scale conflict, to ensure our enemies always fear the jungle."
CVA_foreign_volunteers:0 "Kásan Volunteers"
CVA_foreign_volunteers_desc:0 "Centuries ago, a ship of slaves revolted against their Colthaginian captors and landed on the shores of Griffonia, founding the Kása Free State as a haven for all those fleeing bondage. Now the descendants of those same slaves have returned, not for vengeance, but to join us in our fight for justice. We welcome our long-lost siblings into the struggle, and swear to resist oppression with the same zeal they have!"
CVA_fighter_fleet:0 "Convert the Crop Dusters"
CVA_fighter_fleet_desc:0 "We do not have an aircraft industry, but a few of the landlords left behind old crop duster planes they had brought in from elsewhere when they fled our advance. With a few modifications, these could serve as our first wing of fighter planes."
CVA_basic_bombers:0 "Improvised Bombers"
CVA_basic_bombers_desc:0 "While we may not have dedicated bomber aircraft, there is nothing stopping us from jury-rigging civilian planes to serve as bombers. While we may not be able to match a proper airforce, a few barrel-bombs dropped on enemy formations should make our foes think twice before advancing out in the open."
CVA_develop_a_doctrine:0 "The Liberation Air Fleet"
CVA_develop_a_doctrine_desc:0 "Our aviators are few in number, but they have each flown dozens of missions. We will gather them together and formalize their chain of command into a proper airforce, so that as we expand our wings that knowledge gets disseminated among new generations of pilots."
CVA_the_flying_jaguars:0 "The Flying Jaguars"
CVA_the_flying_jaguars_desc:0 "The Jaguar can wait in hiding for hours on end, then leap and catch its prey out of the air, dragging it back to earth. Our fighter wings shall emulate this ambush strategy, hiding in the clouds and striking enemy bomber formations from every angle before returning to the safety of our airbases and flak guns."
CVA_close_range_support:0 "Combined Arms Tactics"
CVA_close_range_support_desc:0 "Now that we have a proper airforce, we should develop new, lighter bomber planes which can deliver munitions more precisely to support our infantry in combat. We will also train our radiozeebs and artillery spotters in how and when to call down such precision airstrikes, to maximize damage and minimize the chance of losing planes or friendly fire."
CVA_defenders_of_the_homeland:0 "Defenders of the Homeland"
CVA_defenders_of_the_homeland_desc:0 "Now that we have formalised the LAE's practices, acquired weapons and integrated the volunteers, we are ready to begin full-scale military expansion and reorganization. The LAE will defend our homes and our people no matter the enemy's ferocity."
CVA_stick_to_the_militias:0 "Reform the Militias"
CVA_stick_to_the_militias_desc:0 "The militia system has served us well throughout our long struggle. While much work must be done to expand the system to administer a modern fighting force of our new size, the essentially decentralised nature of the system will foster low-echelon initiative backed up by the fighting spirit of zebras fighting for their homes alongside their friends and neighbours."
CVA_elected_officers:0 "Elected Officers"
CVA_elected_officers_desc:0 "Our officers should be chosen from among their units. This will foster a closeness between the enlisted zebras and their leaders, quite different from the callous disregard for their soldiers engendered by more aristocratic officer traditions. We trust that zebras who fight and die alongside one another will know who best to lead them better than some distant pencil-pushers."
CVA_autonomous_recruiting:0 "Localised Recruiting"
CVA_autonomous_recruiting_desc:0 "A village is like a large family, and so is a platoon. We will set up recruitment and conscription offices out in the furthest villages, and structure our training and deployment procedures such that our troops will always fight alongside the friends and neighbours they fight for."
CVA_professionalism:0 "Professionalise the LAE"
CVA_professionalism_desc:0 "While the decentralized militia model has many advantages, it simply is insufficient to the kind of large-scale conventional warfare we are likely to face now that we have liberated Coltva. We must create a disciplined, regimented force of professional soldiers who will stick to the plans conceived by a centralized high command."
CVA_actual_officers:0 "Modern Officer Training Methods"
CVA_actual_officers_desc:0 "We will invite foreign instructors to cooperate with the hardened veterans of the LAE to train a new generation of officers, so that our army will always have effective and innovative commanders guided by both modern military theory and the LAE's hard experience."
CVA_proper_discipline:0 "A Will Of Iron, And A Heart Of Steel"
CVA_proper_discipline_desc:0 "As appealing as the romantic ideal of the passionate peasant-soldier are, they simply cannot stand up to the modern battlefield. Our officers and our soldiers must be stoic, unyielding, and unquestioning in their execution of their orders. They cannot be clouded by doubt, and must be guided by duty and service rather than pride, passion, or personal motives."
CVA_hill_warriors:0 "Warriors Of the Hills"
CVA_hill_warriors_desc:0 "In another army, "Run to the hills!" is the cry of defeat. For us it is a cunning feint. We will train our soldiers in fighting in the rugged highlands of our country, learning to navigate and exploit every crevice and ridge to ambush, harry and exhaust our foe before delivering the coup de grace."
CVA_limited_motorisation:0 "Incorporate Motorised Units"
CVA_limited_motorisation_desc:0 "While motorized units may not be particularly effective in the hills and jungles, their mobility particularly in flat terrain cannot be overstated. We should incorporate these units and corresponding tactics into our forces in order to better achieve victory on the modern battlefield."
CVA_partisan_legacy:0 "A Legacy Of Struggle"
CVA_partisan_legacy_desc:0 "The LAE has gone from a ragtag band of rebels into a formidable modern fighting force. But we must never forget our roots, and never become the domineering, imperialistic organization so many other armies have become. With every new generation, we will impress upon our soldiers the meaning of their service, and the legacy they must uphold."

CVA_the_navy:0 "Look To the Sea"
CVA_the_navy_desc:0 "For centuries, the Colthaginians would transport slaves across the sea in ships of misery. At the same time, heroic tales abound of pirates raiding these ships and freeing these slaves. If we are to get our goods to the world market and disrupt the lifelines of our enemies, we need to found a proper navy to contest the Colthaginian dominance of the seas."
CVA_repurpose_fishing_ships:0 "Repurpose the Fishing Ships"
CVA_repurpose_fishing_ships_desc:0 "Some of our larger fishing ships can be repurposed to serve as convoys and auxiliary military ships."
CVA_build_up_the_shipyards:0 "Build Up the Horsemuz Shipyards"
CVA_build_up_the_shipyards_desc:0 "In order to compete with our neighbours, we will have to encourage a major expansion of our shipyards and drydocks."
CVA_buildup_fishing_industry:0 "Protect The Fisheries"
CVA_buildup_fishing_industry_desc:0 "Our enemies are ruthless. We cannot assume they will restrict themselves to targetting military vessels and those carrying war materiel; if we let them they will torpedo even fishing vessels to starve us out and spread fear. Outfitting destroyers is therefore not only necessary to protect our industry, but also our people."
CVA_seize_colthage_ships:0 "Repurpose Mothballed Colthaginian Ships"
CVA_seize_colthage_ships_desc:0 "The Colthaginian navy left several aging hulks in our harbours. While these are woefully outdated, we can salvage their hulls and refurbish them to fill a role in our navy."
CVA_develop_submarines:0 "The Guerillas Of the Sea"
CVA_develop_submarines_desc:0 "Seek, strike, fade. It is how we fought our long guerilla war, and it is hwo submarines operate as well. We will focus our efforts on developing these sea raiding craft, to better disrupt our enemy's shipping and starve their industries."

It had all happened so fast she could hardly process it, but there it was, in black-and-white: she was getting compensated for the land the rebels had taken from her, and the amount was enough that her family would be rich zebras once again.\n\nAnza had feared for her life when the Zeirudtistas had taken over Coltva, and when her land was confiscated she'd almost been ready to flee, and damn their promises that she would be compensated "when the crisis was over." But today, they'd kept their promise. Her old tenets showed up to the tribunal, one by one, telling their stories of how fair she'd been, how she'd always kept the rents low, how she'd forgiven their debts in the lean years. The three zebras making up her villagee tribunal had deliberated, reviewed documents about historical land claims, and when they'd come to their decision Anza was sure she'd misheard: she was to be paid the full value of the land, and then some.\n\nShe wouldn't get the land back; the age of large landlords was over and it wouldn't even be profitable at this point, but she had enough to invest in the growing industrial sector, or start a business, or whatever she wanted to do! Her foals would grow up affluent, no, they would grow up rich!

### Focuses ###
CVA_CTH_fixing_whats_broken:0 "In Zeshmunazash's Memory" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_fixing_whats_broken_desc:0 "Through the fire and the storm we have fought. Despite the trials, and despite the loss of our beloved leader, we came out on top. Now, at the founding of the great Colthaginian Federation, Zarishat Zeirutid addresses the nation to honor the memory of her dear brother."
CVA_CTH_a1:0 "Punish The Landlords" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a1_desc:0 "Our struggle was born in the farmlands of Coltva thanks to the rapacity of the landlords, and though the path was long, we now are in a position to deal with them for good. No more shall they exploit the common zebra, for today is the day of reckoning!"
CVA_CTH_a2:0 "Target The Scientific Clique" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a2_desc:0 "The Scientifics are still out there, and though they are beaten, they are not yet broken. Unless we make sure to deal with them on a more permanent basis, we will not be able to rest on our laurels. They had their chance, history judged them wanting, and now they pay the price. "
CVA_CTH_a3:0 "Anti-Intellectual Proscriptions" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a3_desc:0 "The republic was in the end little more than a playground for ivory tower intellectuals to engage in endless quibbling as they invented a million forms of reactionary pseudo-ideologies. Yet, there's an equally misguided as widespread pride in this system, and it will not be easily uprooted." 
CVA_CTH_a4:0 "Starites In Our Midst" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a4_desc:0 "Of all the movements that has taken hold in the federation, the Starites must be the most insane of them all. Between their weird esoteric beliefs, their secrecy and utter and complete lack of anything resembling mercy or restraint, they seem more akin to a fever dream than an actual movement. They are real though, and they will need to be dealt with."
CVA_CTH_a5:0 "Tackling The Famine" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a5_desc:0 "Thanks to the chaos of these last years, malnutrition and starvation runs rampant. Between corruption, devastation, mismanagement and seemingly sheer malice, we are not producing even nearly enough to feed the people. This must be addressed, and fast."
CVA_CTH_a6:0 "Redefine The Plan Of Kizil-Zeb" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a6_desc:0 "The Kizil-Zeb Plan saw many successes in Coltva, but Zarishat is unconvinced that it is what the federation needs. The time to make concessions is long since past, and if the lack of a gentle hoof means the reactionaries will be more willing to resist... well isn't that killing two birds with one stone?"
CVA_CTH_a7:0 "Karamane Plantation Collectivisation" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a7_desc:0 "The rubber plantations in southern Zition have long been a cash cow for the state, even if more and more of it has been bought up by private interests. This will be rectified, and the its resources will once more belong to the people."
CVA_CTH_a8:0 "Zeordu Farmland Consolidation" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a8_desc:0 "in Coltva, the land reforms could be steadily carried out over a long time. Now, we will act decisively and swiftly. Zeordu will be the first to be transformed as we carry out our land reforms in one blow. It will be a messy affair, but the lessons learned will allow us to carry our further reforms going ahead with much greater ease."
CVA_CTH_a9:0 "Restructure The Textile Industry" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a9_desc:0 "Colthage's textile industry was born out of an attempt to compete with the Maregyptians' cotton, and it was decently successful at this. A plan has been proposed by Zillquat Zaladid, a former technocrat who joined the socialist cause, under which this industry can be brought into the fold and expanded both."
CVA_CTH_a10:0 "Corrective Labour" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a10_desc:0 "Clemency is a luxury, and luxuries are the mark of the bourgeoisie. Those who fought against us are too many to do away with, but that doesn't mean we can't make sure that they pay us back for the troubles they caused us through toil and sweat."
CVA_CTH_a11:0 "The Work For Bread Program" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a11_desc:0 "The famine must be dealt with posthaste, and as a part of it, a program has been put forth under which food items will constitute valid payment for labour. There are precious few who are not struggling to feed themselves, and this will not only free up monetary resources, but also mitigate their hunger."
CVA_CTH_a12:0 "A Ban On Usury" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a12_desc:0 "The amount of zebras trapped in debt by scheming moneylenders and banks is nothing short of obscene, and the remedy is simple. From this day forward, charging interest will be outlawed completely, and those who have charged too high interest will be forced to pay back said interest."
CVA_CTH_a13:0 "Department Of National Agricultural Organization" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a13_desc:0 "With the tumultous land reforms that have been carried out recently, we will have to make sure to keep clear records of who owns what land, and redistribute it as needed to ensure maximum production. Farmers shall own their lands, true, but the state will administer its distribution."
CVA_CTH_a14:0 "Industrial Reconstruction" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a14_desc:0 "The colthaginian industrial sector is much like its agricultural one; infested with oligarchs and monopolists. As we've started to deal with the issue of the famine, we can now turn our gaze to this field and ensure that the industrial sector is brought in line with the revolutionary ideals as well."
CVA_CTH_a15:0 "Agricultural Quotas" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a15_desc:0 "If the famine shall be defeated, all must give all they can. We can trust in our revolutionary brothers, but there are many farmers who might not be as motivated. If they will not act out of revolutionary zeal, they will simply have to act out of legal obligation as we implement strict quotas to be met."
CVA_CTH_a16:0 "Penal Worker Settlements" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a16_desc:0 "The thousands of reactionaries who now pay off their debt to the federation through labour can be found all over Colthage. In order to make the most of them, it is for the best that we concentrate them to special settlements where work is plenty and security is high."
CVA_CTH_a17:0 "National Department Of Labour" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a17_desc:0 "The labour produced by our people is a precious resources, not to be squandered. Yet the supply and demand is also unevenly distributed. Ozid has spearheaded the creation of a department dedicated to making sure that wherever there is a job that needs doing, we will find someone able to do it."
CVA_CTH_a18:0 "Selective Charity" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a18_desc:0 "The state cannot do everything, and at times, private interests can be helpful. We should encourage and support private initiatives, but that doesn't mean we can't make sure to aid those charities who are friendly to us, and hinder those who have ideas we don't approve of."
CVA_CTH_a19:0 "Restructure The Academia" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a19_desc:0 "The colthaginian institutes of higher learning have a long and proud history, but they are also a fertile breeding ground for technocrats and other counter-revolutionaries. In order to ensure the security of our nation, we will simply have to reorganise them in order to ensure our students learn the right lessons."
CVA_CTH_a20:0 "The Future Of The Nation" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a20_desc:0 "Our universites have been reorganised and expanded, and they are now ready to educate the next generation of federation leaders and scientists."
CVA_CTH_a21:0 "Mass Reindustrialisation" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a21_desc:0 "The age of famine and poverty is coming to an end. Thanks to the efforts of our people and the leadership of our government, we are reaching a point where our industry is well and truly restored to the level of its glory days."
CVA_CTH_a22:0 "Social Justice" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a22_desc:0 "None shall be left behind, and none shall feel like they are ignored by our nation. This is our pledge to the people of the federation, no matter their race or their ancestry."
CVA_CTH_c1:0 "Going Cold Turkey" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c1_desc:0 "Alcohol doesn't ask questions or comment on how your brother is such a shining exemplar. It doesn't make you feel inadequate or force you to live in the shadows of others. It's been her comfort for so long, and gods she will miss it..."
CVA_CTH_c2:0 "Work With Bandolier" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c2_desc:0 "Zannido Zidon is a menace like few, but he is not completely unreasonable. Though he's infamous in most of the country, the prefecture of Zidon views him as a hero. Maybe we should consider working with him? Though it'd be deeply unpopular to many, it'd bring the northwest into our fold as well as give us a talentet general."
CVA_CTH_c3:0 "We Have No Need For Bandits" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c3_desc:0 "Zannido Zidon is a bandit and a murderer. He has no place in the federation except in the deepest dungeon! We have pledged to be the leaders of this land, and how would it look if we bargained with his ilk?"
CVA_CTH_c5:0 "Committee Of Public Salvation" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c5_desc:0 "It'd be naive in the extreme to think that just because we won, the nation will be behind us. Our top priority right now should be to make sure that we give the people safety from all those who would tear down that which we are building."
CVA_CTH_c6:0 "Streamline The Judicial Process" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c6_desc:0 "We will stand behind justice, but we cannot be bogged down in procedure while we do so. Greater weight given to witnesses loyal to our cause, making the defendants defend themselves and similar policies will allow us to expedite the process."
CVA_CTH_c7:0 "Bureaucratic Reconstruction Effort" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c7_desc:0 "The old bureaucracy left from before our victory is not inherently broken. It can still serve us as long as we make sure to pay special heed to flush out any leftover loyalists. That way, the people can still interact with the old familiar institutions, even though it inwardly is rebuilt from the ground up. "
CVA_CTH_c8:0 "The Anti-Constitutionalist Decree" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c8_desc:0 "Some would have considered the Constitutionalists allies, but that was before the death of Zeshmunazash. They proved their true mettle then, and we have not forgotten. Yet at the same time, they are not a threat like the technocrats. Their party will be outlawed and they will be thrown in jail, but we will leave it at that."
CVA_CTH_c9:0 "A Bullet For The Fascists" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c9_desc:0 "When you are dealing with a disease, equivocating or waffling around will only hurt you even more. Fascism was born as the worst reaction to the revolution, and they shall be exterminated, lest their twisted ideology takes root once again."
CVA_CTH_c10:0 "A Bayonet For The Patricians" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c10_desc:0 "The elites have sat in their mansions and estates for centuries, preening mightily above the heads of the common worker. They think they can scramble to secure their position in the new order as well, but we wil lteach them the folly of their ways. "
CVA_CTH_c11:0 "Mass Property Re-Acquisition" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c11_desc:0 "The elites had built their tiny fiefdoms across Colthage, and unimaginable wealth had been gathered here. These great properties, built on the backs of the exploited, will be reclaimed by the people's state so that those who worked to build it may reap the fruits of their work. "
CVA_CTH_c12:0 "Restore Order In Hippone" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c12_desc:0 "The Starites have been allowed to run rampant for too long. With stability slowly returning in the heartland, we can now march east and show them that a bunch of jesters in gas masks are no match for the strength of the people!"
CVA_CTH_c13:0 "Restore The Hippone Territorial Fleet" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c13_desc:0 "The starites' rampage left our naval assets in the region beached and used for other purposes. Thankfully, the damage is not that severe. With sufficient work, we can restore this important part of our navy to its prime.  "
CVA_CTH_c14:0 "The Semblance Of Normalcy" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c14_desc:0 "It's come step by step, but news of fighting are getting rarer. Arrests and interrogations are getting more uncommon and the bureaucracy is back up and running. All of a sudden, it feels like it's over."
CVA_CTH_b1:0 "REvolutionary Conscription" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b1_desc:0 "Though the war is over, we are not safe yet, and if we are to ensure the integrity of our federation we must have an army up to the task. The shattered remnants of Colthage's army might well have what we're looking for. If we make sure to sift away ideologues and fanatics, many of them simply wish to fight for their home."
CVA_CTH_b2:0 "Military Worker Brigades" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b2_desc:0 "Our army consists of tens of thousands of able-bodied and highly organised zebras. While there is no war going on they would be better off assisting our rebuilding efforts. Not only will this aid recovery efforts, but it will also help those lacking faith in the revolutionary cause to build respect for the workers."
CVA_CTH_b3:0 "The Modern Liberation Army" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b3_desc:0 "Militias and guerillas might have been where we started, but we will need something more going ahead. War is an industry these days, and we must apply all our efforts towards industrialising our army. "
CVA_CTH_b4:0 "Basic Combat Roles" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b4_desc:0 "Not every zebra will serve the same purpose in battle. Some will shoot, others will dig, others will patch wounds and yet others will handle reconnaissance. This divison of martial labour will strengthen our forces immensely."
CVA_CTH_b5:0 "Alchemical Proliferation" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b5_desc:0 "The old traditions of alchemy have never gone away, and under us they will flourish. If we make sure that all our units have ready access to the skills and materials needed, they will become stronger in a way only zebras can truly be for it.  "
CVA_CTH_b6:0 "Rifle Standardisation" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b6_desc:0 "The fewer unique parts to an item, the easier it is to produce. Leaving behind the rag-tag armament of our coltvan days, we will now have one standardised rifle across the entirety of our military and police."
CVA_CTH_b7:0 "Reinforce Officer Preorgative" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b7_desc:0 "As much as the OARA is a valued asset, they cannot be allowed to run roughshod over the military. That'd create a cadre of sycophants instead of the able officers' corps we need."
CVA_CTH_b8:0 "Expand The REvolutionary General Staff" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b8_desc:0 "We are sorely lacking in capable officers, and we must make sure to rectify this. Thankfully, General Monzano has given us a list of promising candidates who are not only loyal to the revolution, but also capable commanders. "
CVA_CTH_b9:0 "The Red Chargers" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b9_desc:0 "The red flag is carried forth by the brave and the true, and it is only right that we form elite cadres to truly lead the way. Those who thought us mere rebels hiding in the woods shall soon find themselves crushed under the hooves of our most elite red chargers."
CVA_CTH_b10:0 "Officer Professionalisation" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b10_desc:0 "To be an officer is a difficult task, and it is wrong to expect it to be done by volunteers who happened to be more popular among their squadmates. Those who take up the task of leadership should be held to the highest professional standards, and be compensated thereafter."
CVA_CTH_b11:0 "Basic Mechanisation" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b11_desc:0 "Even the fastest zebra cannot outrun a modern vehicle, and if we make sure our soldiers are mounted on these vehicles we can redeploy them must faster and without the exhaustion that a long forced march would lead to."
CVA_CTH_b12:0 "Masters Of Metallurgy" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b12_desc:0 "We zebras were the first to forge metal, and yet across the world there are those who would presume themselves our betters. Reaffirming our mastery is not only a patriotic duty, but also sound military thinking. "
CVA_CTH_b13:0 "Pacify The Zebinop Countryside" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b13_desc:0 "Zarza really does not know when to quit. He has rampaged through Zebinop for too long, and his tenacity shows that the only way to stop him will be through bullets. Fortunately, he does not have the kind of armies he once commanded under him, so deploying in force will allow us to end the threat."
CVA_CTH_b14:0 "Masters Of Alchemy" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b14_desc:0 "Alchemy, foundation of modern chemistry, the first joining of magic and science. It is a mark of pride for many zebras, and the federation will not lag behind in developing these arts. "
CVA_CTH_b15:0 "Our Dignity Restored" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b15_desc:0 "The countless threats to the federation has been steadily pushed back, and though we are not done yet, we are in a position where none can truly question our status as the rightful rulers of colthage."
CVA_CTH_b16:0 "National Pacification Campaign" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b16_desc:0 "With the main threats to the federation crushed, we can now turn our attention to the myriad other factions ranging from protestors to bandit groups. If they lay down their arms and surrender that is good. If they refuse to the end we will not hesitate. One way or another, we will have peace again."
CVA_CTH_b17:0 "The Office Of Anti-Reactionary Activities" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b17_desc:0 "Not all threats to the revolution will be overt such, and if we hope to create true stability, we must be mindful of the threats that might seek to subvert our armed forces. The OARA will keep a close eye on them to ensure that they remain faithful."
CVA_CTH_b18:0 "The Federal Territorial Guard" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b18_desc:0 "The countryside is vast, and there is everything from roving monsters to counter-revolutionaries hiding out there. The FTG will be our weapon here, well armed and motivated soldiers who can uphold law and order in the countryside and protect those who live there from aggression of any kind." 
CVA_CTH_b19:0 "OARA Field Officer Department" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b19_desc:0 "The OARA's work never ends, and the military is of particular interest. Integrating OARA officers into the military hierarchy will ensure that this structure never can be compromised."
CVA_CTH_b20:0 "Police Militarisation" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b20_desc:0 "With the rapid progress made, and with tonnes of surplus weapons left after the revolution, there are many dangers facing our officers of the law. We cannot trust in batons to solve the challenges they will face; they will need proper arms and training."
CVA_CTH_the_revolution_secure:0 "Evolve The Revolution" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_the_revolution_secure_desc:0 "The policies of Zarishat and her advisors have secured peace and prosperity once again. Rising above all the forces that stood against her, she is now the heart and soul of the colthaginian revolution, and she knows what lies next for the nation."

colthaginian_federation.1.t:0 "On The Shoulders Of A Giant" #Sweet
colthaginian_federation.1.d:0 "The sun was too bright, the crowd too loud, and the gentle breeze did nothing to stop her headache. Zarishat took a deep breath as she held onto the pulpit, feeling her mouth water weirdly and a wave of nausea came over her. At least, her quickly covering her mouth and looking down probably came across as grief, and she swallowed to push the nausea down.\n\n"Fellow comrades of the revolution," she began, her voice raspy from the night before. "I never expected to be standing here before you today. This was meant to be my brother's moment... like everything else in life. He always stood there, shining like he was so much better than everyone else and-and we are all left weeping over his death." It was an exertion to correct herself, as all she wanted to do was to puke bile all over that self-righteous, arrogant pig she had endured her entire life. Getting back on topic, she continued with more fervor.\n\n"But I promise you, comrades of the struggle, that we are not stopping here. We are not quitting the struggle, indeed we have only begun! The revolution marches forward, and we shall complete my brother's labours! We shall punish those who ended his life, as we shall bring justice down upon those who have exploited and oppressed us for so long! The revolution lives!" She finished, actually managing to cry out and raise one hoof up to the air and provoke a thunderous response from the onlookers. It all kept going for way too long, and when she finally got off the stage she shook her head in exhaustion.\n\nShe had a chance right now, a chance unlike anything she'd ever imagined possible. With her brother out of the picture, she was the one they looked to for leadership, and if she didn't seize this opportunity, she'd never see anything like it again. Who'd have thought the best thing her brother could do for her was to die..."
colthaginian_federation.1.a:0 "Now to take a nice, long nap" 

colthaginian_federation.2.t:0 "The Generalissimo" 
colthaginian_federation.2.d:0 "News are trickling in from Zebinop-Amanesya, where the old order has come roaring back. We had thought Zarza was dealt with, but he evidently isn't down for the count yet. Along with a cadre of loyalists and allies, he has seize the region, cut Colthage in two and caused chaos. His army is deeply dug in across the hilly region, and attempts to dislodge them have already failed. If we are to stop that zebra, it'll take resources we don't have right now." 
colthaginian_federation.2.a:0 "Why couldn't he have just died?"

colthaginian_federation.3.t:0 "The Star Father's Children" 
colthaginian_federation.3.d:0 "Hippone has fallen.\n\nWhat information we have is disjointed and sometimes contradictory, but what we do know is that militants have seized the Hippone region. They are seemingly not connected to any of the factions we have contended with so far, and instead seem connected to the local patricians somehow. Wherever these masked figures come from though, they have quickly established a hard grip over the region. They are numerous and well armed, and the best we have managed to achieve is to contain them in Hippone, for now."
colthaginian_federation.3.a:0 "Who are these people even!?"

colthaginian_federation.4.t:0 "The Political Mosquitoes" #Sweet
colthaginian_federation.4.d:0 "It seems the Consitutionalists are determined to continue defying us. While their power has been broken, it's not fully gone yet, and they are hard at work trying to rally support against the Zarishat government. Their junior members — especially those that were allowed to remain on their posts after our takeover, have been relentlessly harrying us, attempting to sway our leaders with speeches and negotiations. Those senior members that we chased out of the government are out there working the government, trying to rally popular support for their ideas as well.\n\nThat they, even after all that they have done, would presume to speak for the common zebra would be amusing, if it were not so annoying. Thankfully they are still weakened, and it is unlikely they will be a real threat instead of just a headache." 
colthaginian_federation.4.a:0 "Hah! As if they're actually relevant!"

colthaginian_federation.5.t:0 "The Landlords"
colthaginian_federation.5.d:0 "Nursing a small headache, Zarishat stared listlessly at the list in front of her. This should be a moment of triumph, the moment that they dealt with the landlords and the patricians that had tormented the workers of Colthage for so long, but all she felt about it was exasperation. Couldn't they just have run out and started lynching zebras left and right, and then they could rein in the worst excesses? No, apparently not. It seemed like she had to take charge even here. \n\nIn Coltva, they had worked slowly and steadily, but now it would all come crashing down at once not the least thanks to the vicious war that had brought them here. Now, they would have to deal with their enemies all at once, and she really didn't care much for dealing with this. No matter the call, she'd piss important zebras off.\n\nThey had to be firm, that much she understood, but going after the technocrats alone wouldn't do it. The zebras under her wanted blood, and the constitutionalists hadn't done themselves any favour. Maybe it'd be for the best to target them as well, and truly bring the wrath of the revolution and all that down on their heads? It'd cause a lot of unrest, but it'd give her army what they wanted. Of course, she could just play nice, blab something about moving forwards and minimise the retaliation against them.\n\nWhatever she did, she had to make a call though. Just make the call, then she could go and get a drink..."
colthaginian_federation.5.a:0 "Both the Constitutionalists and the Technocrats shall know our wrath!"
colthaginian_federation.5.b:0 "Zarza and his cronies shall be punished."
colthaginian_federation.5.c:0 "Let's play the 'moving forwards together' angle..."

colthaginian_federation.6.t:0 "Tea Time With Monzano" #Sweet
colthaginian_federation.6.d:0 ""So... what do you think you are trying to accomplish with this stunt?" General Monzano sat leaned forwards, staring Zarishat down. Zarishat, meanwhile, just wanted to throw the general out but refrained from it. She needed Monzano, and she wasn't in a position to throw away the sole general of the Coltvan armed forces she actually was on good terms with. It didn't make her any less annoying right now though.\n\n"I was trying to throw them a bone, give them something little so they can see that we're not going to hang them all indiscriminately."\n\n"You backed down in a moment of triumph," Monzano continued. "You showed weakness, and they are going to pounce on this. And what of your comrades? They'll see their due retribution being cast aside, only getting this waffling about... what, harmony?"\n\n"I'm not going to turn into Celestia, and I'm not going to be weak," Zarishat snapped. "You want to see retribution and a firm hoof? You'll get it, just you wait and see. I gave them a little morsel now, but if they get snippy, they'll taste dirt!"\n\n"That is all I ask," Monzano nodded, mollified, and leaned back to raise her teacup. "To the federation.""

colthaginian_federation.8.t:0 "The Hanging Cedars" 
colthaginian_federation.8.d:0 "The madness of this 'Star Father' is like a cancer. It is buried deep into our society, festering among the patrician class as they try to realise their 'Covenant of Zebrakind'. They already control Hippone, and countless of its adherents lurk silently among us where they just wait for a moment to strike. These adherents must be rooted out, and we know that to remove a tumour, some healthy flesh must be sacrificed as well.\n\nWhile we at first grasped at straws, we have managed to capture at least some of them, and our methods of extracting information from them has had to be suitably brutal. If we are to get rid of this disease, we cannot flinch, and we cannot hesitate. This secret society lives through those things, and as we stare them down, they will be the ones to flinch first. The bodies of those who wanted to usher in the vision of their 'Star Father' now hang from the cedar trees outside Colthage, where their deaths stand as a warning to all those who thought their wanted secrecy would keep them safe. The sons and daughters of the revolution will do whatever it takes to crush its enemies." 
colthaginian_federation.8.a:0 "Their covenant will be shattered." 

colthaginian_federation.9.t:0 "Going Cold Turkey" #Sweet
colthaginian_federation.9.d:0 "Zarishat didn't know what to do during the evenings if she didn't drink, nor did she really feel like her mornings were as they ought to if she wasn't nursing at least a dry mouth. It'd been going on for so long that it was just the way things were. It was natural, and at least the moments of inebriation provided some kind of comfort. It blocked out all the things she didn't want to deal with, and rested over her like a comforting blanket.\n\nOf course it was killing her, she didn't need zebras telling her that. Not that many of them would these days. She could drink as much as she jolly well wanted, and none would bother her, and that was why she had to end it here and now. This wasn't about what she desired, this was about what she had to do. She couldn't blame others for her hangovers and drunken evenings any longer. She'd had this position fall onto her out of sheer luck, but either she stopped now, or she'd slip up and share her brother's fate sooner or later.\n\nThat was why she stood by the sink, pouring out every last bottle of alcohol she had, making sure to not breathe through her nose so the smell wouldn't tempt her. How long had she lasted before? A week maybe, two at one point. It was now or never though, and she grimaced as she finished pouring out the last bottle and put it on the counter. Pouring herself a mug of tea, she sipped it and instantly felt the desire to pour in some liquor as well. She could order someone to get her some whisky, that would fit perfectly.\n\nBut no, she was done. She fought back the urge and sighed. First urge puhed down, only a lifetime's worth of it left."
colthaginian_federation.9.a:0 "Baal almighty this is going to suck..."
  
colthaginian_federation.10.t:0 "The Demon's Drink" #Sweet
colthaginian_federation.10.d:0 "The last weeks had been miserable, and Zarishat had had a constant headache along with sweating, nightmares and even spells of dizziness. She wanted nothing more than to drink, and it wasn't getting easier. Thankfully, she'd found ways to occupy herself, doubling down on her other passions in life. Her personal chefs had been run ragged, whipping up new luxurious meals for her that could help with the distraction, and doing so daily. If she could not drink, she'd have the best food available, and drown out the need for drink with the pleasures that food gave.  Along with it, she'd taken up new hobbies to distract herself. Manehattan designer clothing, Saddle Arabian jewelry, even Aquileian headwear, and though she couldn't drink any longer, she could tickle the senses in other ways, be it Hindian incense or Wingbardian perfumes.\n\nIf she couldn't have a drink, she'd have everything else. It was what she always had wanted, and she was going to indulge herself as a reward for her triumph not only over the counterrevolutionaries, but the alcohol as well." 
colthaginian_federation.10.a:0 "I am the one in control."

colthaginian_federation.11.t:0 "A Change Of Plans" #Sweet
colthaginian_federation.11.d:0 "Zanno had never viewed his tenants as so many of the other landlords did. To him, they were not subjects for him to lord over or lessers that needed his firm hoof; they were his partners in tending to the land. Their poverty said nothing of their character, nor did his wealth. He preferred to be guided by his grandmother's last words; "I'd rather hear once of your kindness, than a thousand times of your wealth". It was hard at times, not the least when the Coltvan peasant uprising had come to his doors. Yet, he had submitted to their Kizil-Zeb plan, believing sincerely that it was the best way to keep peace, and that from his concession they all could move forward together.\n\nYet, it had become clear to him that he had been alone in that thought. While at first he had thought things would get better, those hopes were dashed as he looked down on the letter, which coldly informed him that he had one week to depart his property with only what he could carry, as the land he occupied was now considered property of the federation. He read it over and over, trying to comprehend what was going on. This couldn't be right, this wasn't what was meant to happen. He had cooperated, hadn't he? He was willing and ready to submit to the Coltvans' government, give up large parts of his property to help his fellow Zebras. Was this his thanks?!\n\nHe slowly put the letter down, moving as if he was in a trance as he walked out of his study. He had to get his family... they had to leave Colthage."  
colthaginian_federation.11.a:0 "This is only the beginning, isn't it?"

colthaginian_federation.12.t:0 "Zago's Gift" 
colthaginian_federation.12.d:0 ""Please sir, do you have any work for me?" The young mare asked as the door opened. She was weak and emaciated and her clothes were tattered. "I'll work as hard as you need me to, I just need some food to-ack!" she exclaimed in surprise as she was dragged inside.\n\n"Well haven't you come to the right place!" the zebra that had met her in the door said as he took her inside. Zebras were everywhere inside the large country building, and they were hard at work moving things around the house. She was confused by it all, but didn't have much time to say anything before she was brought into the kitchen and had a large bowl of stew put down in front of her. "Here, eat! I'll talk while you eat."\n\n"See, we're rebuilding this place into an agricultural cooperative. After we chased out the landlords, there's plenty of fields for strong hooves to tend. Have you ever worked a farm?" the mare looked up from the stew she was scarfing down and nodded. "Then you will have more than a job here. We need as many as we can to help out. What do you think? Work, a home and food for as long as you're here, and you get a chance to aid in the revolution along with your fellow comrades!"\n\nShe didn't have a clue what he was on about. Was this connected to all the fighting in the recent months? She'd been hiding in the mountains until it all died down, but now it seemed like she had missed something really big. She knew this wasn't a chance she could waste though, and she nodded fervently."

colthaginian_federation.13.d:0 ""Zaal-Zanit on a biscuit, this building's never getting finished, is it?" Rolling his head around to soften up his neck, the Zebra put his trowel away in the rack and walked down the half-finished stairs, over to the breadline. "Think we'll work here until the day we die?"\n\n"I hope so," his fellow worker said, "that way we don't have to worry about where to get food again."\n\n"I mean, I'd like to not do this when I'm sixty?" The first zebra shrugged, stepping forward as one worker after another was given a package of food. It was a long line, but thankfully things were moving quickly. There was no shortage of eager zebras willing to work just for a chance to feed their families, so there was little desire to cause a ruckus. Better to get your food and leave for the day, you didn't get much other work right now. By the time it was their turn, the two zebras accepted their packages and quickly stepped out of the way as they began heading home.\n\n"See you tomorrow," the zebra said, bidding his coworker farewell as he once again looked down into the package. As flippant as he was, this would feed both him and his wife and right now that was all that he needed."

colthaginian_federation.14.d:0 "Zuan might have gone to university due to his parents forcing him, and he might have found it all tedious to a fault, but that was then. Now was now, and he had concluded that boredom was underrated. Boredom meant you weren't getting shot at, and after the last months, he gladly settled for that.\n\nThe university was the same as it always had been, with some exceptions. As he walked toward the lecture hall, he noted that the old painting that once had hung in the corridor portraying to founders of Colthage was picked down, having been replaced with a painting of a farmer and a factory worker shaking hooves with a doctor and... well a lawyer he supposed. Probably hung up by the new government. At least the classes would be the same boring ones they had been before the war, with the same boring classmates.\n\nAs he entered and found a place, he looked forward to slipping down into the familiar miasma of tedium, only to be surprised as the lecturer began by telling them that the curriculum had been revised, and that in addition they would be assigned a new bloc of classes. Schedules were passed around the classroom, and Zuan looked at it in befuddlement. "Socialist Theory", "Marksist Economic Theory", "REvolutionary History" and "International Economics" were all scattered across the semester schedule, and Zuan grimaced. It seemed like it wasn't going to be quite as boring as he'd hoped for."

colthaginian_federation.15.d:0 "Morning meetings were nothing new at the factory, but the workers couldn't remember it being quite as... zealous. An angry foreman was one thing, but the way the new one was standing in front of them, yelling about how they were soldiers on the front line of the socialist struggle, and how every day they fought here was one day that the nation might be spared the ravages of the reactionaries and the fascists. Few of them had been ardent socialists before the war. Those who were had gone away during the civil war.\n\nYet, it was inspiring all the same. Many of them had still been in the area when the war had swept through, and the artillery barrages had brought down large parts of the entire district. The fact that the socialists had managed to rebuild it so quickly was impressive, but it was also very clear that they weren't just simple workers any more. The new bosses took their work very seriously, which was nice on one hoof, but on the other... nozebra wanted to be the first to disappoint them. If they were 'soldiers' now, they'd have to deliver, that much was made quite clear, and if they had hoped for a return to a sedate life after the end of the war, that hope was thoroughly quashed."

colthaginian_federation.16.t:0 "The Cogs Of Prosperity" #Sweet
colthaginian_federation.16.d:0 "Every major industry and every agricultural collective sent reports to her office on a monthly basis. These reports were collated and put together into a list, which Zarishat poured over to get a sense of where the nation was heading. For months now the reports had been miserable to read, but there was a clear pattern starting to emerge. Things were heading upwards, slowly but steadily. Where once so many sectors had struggled to even get production up and running, there were now not only stable increases in production, but in some areas there were surpluses being reported.\n\nPutting down the report, Zarishat leaned back in her chair to savour her success, for that was what it was.

Once, as the son of a wealthy patrician, he had idolised the life of the simple farmer. Rise at dawn, hard physical work to strengthen the body, the simple and straightforward existence of knowing exactly what you needed to do. What a foal he had been.\n\nRising up from his bunk bed as the bells rang outside, he groaned as he rolled his neck, feeling the pain in the left side of it. Still sore, and had been for three day now. All he had done was try to argue with the guards that his bunkmate was sick and couldn't work as hard as they wanted. That, apparently, made him deserve the baton to them. His bunkmate wasn't looking too cheery either. He was pale, and that infection on his leg didn't look good at all.\n\nUrging the young zebra to come with him, he walked outside to line up and receive the day's instructions from the camp commander. It was cold outside, and he shivered slightly. The landscape where their camp lay was beautiful, that much he could admit, but it was kind of hard to see beyond the quarry, the high barbed wire fences and the guard towers. Once, he probably would have loved to go hiking in these hills. Now he and all the others would stare at them until the socialists were done with them, whenever that would be.\n\nHe hadn't given up yet though, he was not going to let them think he was broken. There were still soldiers who looked to him for leadership, or at least hope, and he still had a duty to them, even if the government he fought for was gone."

Not only had the civil war shaken a lot of his beliefs, the rise of the Zarishat regime had been worse than he had feared it would be. To think that he once had been carefully optimistic about Zeshmunazash, and argued that there could be and indeed should be rapprochement with the coltvan socialists. He'd already had to eat crow over that whole fiasco, and who knew what would happen next? At least there were still those who spoke out. As long as they did, perhaps the regime would realise they couldn't do whatever they pleased.\n\nSighing, he rose up from his desk to take a walk. At least he could swing by his favourite coffee shop and enjoy a cup before continuing to work. Stepping outside and locking the door, he nodded to the small group of his neighbours as he passed them by. They were standing by a corner and seemed to be reading some flyer, though he didn't much care to stop and chat with them about it. They were simple zebras, and he had enough on his mind already.\n\nHis neighbours looked quietly up from the flyer at him as he passed, and then down at it again. After a few seconds they nodded to each other and began after him. He was a prick anyway, and they needed the money. And besides, if they could make sure the new government knew of them as loyal citizens for having handed over a 'subversive intellectual' instead of harbouring one, then all the better."

Father, sergeant, hero, all those things he had been was gone after the civil war had taken everything from him, and right now shelter and food were the only things he could really think of. What else was there he could think of? At least the news of the soup kitchen in the west of the city had given him something to hope for, and he had slowly made his way there.\n\nAs it turned out, it was more than just a soup kitchen. It seemed to be an entire outdoor mess, and there were dozens of zebras waiting in line as they were given a large bowl of soup and bread. He quietly got in line, awed by the sight and daring for the first time to feel something resembling hope. Were they really offering help? Could he hope for a full belly?\n\nAs he drew nearer, he heard the zebras state their old units before they got the bowl and tried to think. It felt like an eternity ago, what had even been his unit? When he remembered it was his turn, and he told them the name of his old Colthaginian unit only to have them freeze.\n\n"You're not getting fed here, traitor," the zebra spat. "Get out of here before I call the police."\n\n"Wh-wh..." He tried to protest. "M'not fightin. Can't... Don't want troubl..." he slurred, had done ever since that grenade, but the zebra didn't listen, instead turning to the side and calling for the police officers that were standing further away. The two came at him and he quickly stumbled away in fear, though not fast enough to avoid a blow before he got far enough away that they stopped pursuing him. Clutching the side of his head, he hurried away as the line began to move again, feeding the soldiers who deserved their help."

Zarishat asked mildly, while in truth focusing on the way his neck wobbled.\n\n"Not a Zebra like that!" Ozid stopped, wiping his forehead as he tried to calm himself down. Zarishat meanwhile kept thinking about it, wondering if there was a rhyme there. "He is an unrepentant murderer, and the people need safety above all else. Seeing their saviours engage with that kind of zebras will make them wonder what we're up to. Our integrity is the most precious thing we have, and we must hold onto it!"

While a certain person might have idealised them, they're uncontrollable and undisciplined. We have a chance to integrate the proper Colthaginian military, and the fact that you focus on them instead of that savage just proves you're the smarter zebra."

colthaginian_federation_2.1.d:0 "What was that expression he had heard once, to fall flank first into success? Zeshmunazash thought to himself that it fit the situation almost too well as he stood on the floor of the senate, looking around himself with a sardonic smile. "So, where to now then, you wonder," he told his gathered advisors. They'd been on his case about what he planned to do now all day. Ozid, Zala, even Zarishat, all had been asking. "I guess we'll just institute a dictatorship. Can start purging the constitutionalists, mass execute the patricians, rob the nation blind, set fire to the jungles and then build a giant diamond statue of myself, unfurl my wings and fly off into space." His bizarre comment left the others taken aback, and it was Zarishat that spoke up after a while.\n\n"What, are you a pegasus now?"\n\n"No and I'm not a dictator either," Zeshmunazash sighed. Of all that he had said, that was what they had reacted to? "I never wanted this, nozebra should have wanted this. We were fighting for land reform, and yet it had to go this far before they let go..." He shook his head. "Idiots, all of them."\n\n"What should be our next move, then?" Ozid asked as Zeshmunazash looked up at the ceiling.\n\n"Same as in Coltva. We'll offer an open hoof and a chance to work together to rebuild. Any who are willing to abandon the idea of fighting us and would rather work with us to fix this mess of a country can join in. This country has been stomped on enough in these last decades, and I don't see how another set of stomps will accomplish anything but more misery. Now we rebuild, and try to make something greater out of the ruins we're left with.""

colthaginian_federation_2.2.d:0 ""We need to remember that the Kizil-Zeb Plan rose as a compromise. Going further would have provoked a backlash, but things have changed. As rural as Coltva was, here it is the urban patricians who rule. They should, no, they MUST, be made part of the plan, otherwise we're showing that the thousands of urban poor who have suffered just as much as the rural poor aren't part of our vision, and why should they support us then?!" Zala was pounding his hoof into the desk to accentuate his point and spoke with volume and zeal both. As Ozid spoke up, his soft voice stood in sharp contrast to the Zala's.\n\n"While you are right, we need to remember its purpose. It is a land reform meant to alleviate the plight of the farmers, nothing more. The urban poor are better helped by new programs focusing on them, not trying to apply the Kizil-Zeb to things it was never meant for. It being a compromise is a strength, not a weakness, because we've already implemented it and seen that it works. Starting to meddle with it now will only cause discontent."\n\n"Nah, let's go with Zala's idea," Zarishat drawled sarcastically. "I'm sure all those still on the fence about us will LOVE seeing us go full Stalliongrad. That won't backfire at all."\n\n"There's already discontent," Zala persisted while ignoring Zarishat. "Why not simply take it all to its logical conclusion, before the reactionaries can reassert themselves? We risk them becoming too big a threat once again."\n\n"They can't turn on us if they don't have the common zebra on their side," Ozid retorted as he dabbed his brow with a hoofkerchief. "And the common zebra is who we are working for and can get on our side without going too far."\n\n"But then again maybe we're not going far enough?" Zeshmunazash offered, preempting Zala's more acerbic retort. "Thank you for your input, but I maintain that...""

The question is how to approach it."\n\n"It should be obvious, no?" Zala asked, Jazelid nodding in agreement. "We have a chance to build these plantations from the ground up as Coltva-style cooperatives, create a new node from which we can spread a better system of agriculture."\n\nAt the other end of the table, Azizelqart Zahummid cleared his throat and provoked two murderous gazes from Zala and Jazelid. "As noble as the sentiment expressed is," the economist began. "I fear it may be overambitious at this time. The system is new to most farmers in the region, and we have pressing concerns to deal with here and now. Reviewing the matter with General Monzano, I would say that the best solution would be to parcel out the land to the farmers that already know how to use the land and offer them profitable contracts to get us bananas, and as many as they can."\n\n"Do we need to commit fully to either?" Jezabzella asked. "Why not simply set aside most of the area for the cooperatives, but allow private plantations to an extent?"\n\n"Not the least since they could serve as trial plantations for local initiatives or experiments," Ozid agreed. Zeshmunazash couldn't help but be amused by the sight of the glamorous patrician sitting next to the frumpy Coltvan, but pushed the thought aside. One way or another, this would strike a serious blow against the famine, but how to go about it?"

The Zeordu region especially had turned out to be a boon, as it produced grain enough to feed tens of thousands. Yet, there were hundreds of thousands starving, and no clear answers of where they should use it.\n\n"...and thus," Ahirom Zadadid argued, "the grain should go to the most economically devastated areas. The faster we can get the economy up and going again, the faster we will feed everycreature else. We must keep a greater perspective here."\n\n"Were we talking about other issues I'd agree, but this is about people dying from starvation." Jezabzella shook her head. "If the issue is starvation, give it to those most at risk, and let us avoid our people dying by us valuing 'the economy' over their lives. Is that not an obvious solution?"\n\n"Yes yes, you're very cute," Zarishat drawled. Her bleary eyes and raspy voice spoke clearly of what she had been doing last night. "I guess why we never saw you in Coltva was because you couldn't have brought your wardrobe and vanity along."\n\n"Perhaps we should inform the janitors, Ozid dear, I think I smelled a sewage leak," Jezabzella airily commented before pretending to notice Zarishat. "Oh, Zarishat dear, did you have any alternatives? Perhaps the wine helped you think of something?"\n\nZarishat's gaze could have melted stone, and Jezabzella's smile was angelic. Instead of exploding, however, she continued. "Use the damn grain to get those who still plan to fight to sit down and behave. Some provinces are hotbeds of resistance, and if we slip them some extra food they'll calm down and we'll stabilise the region. Economy or lives won't matter if we collapse when attacked."\n\n"Okay we'll end for the day," Zeshmunazash sighed. They'd all had a chance to give their input, and if Zarishat and Jezabzella wanted to snipe at each other they could do so on their own time. Right now, the grain mattered more."

Gathered in the main lecture hall, he felt his head spin as he watched the students up at the front talking to the professor in a way that would have gotten him thrown out before the war.\n\n"We've also been discussing assignments," one of the students said as she read from a list, "and we want to request that we stop getting assignments on Friday meant to be done on Monday. We're okay with waiting a bit longer for feedback if we can just have the whole week and not the weekend."\n\n"Oh now you're just being lazy," Professor Zomilcar scoffed.

The university was just like how he remembered it, almost uncannily so. As he walked to class, it felt as if he was slipping back into a comfortable old robe. Even the seats were the same, and he sat down and scooted into a semi comfortable position. Professor Zomilcar soon arrived and his briefcase on the table.\n\n"Now, starting where we left off before all this," he drawled, Zuan giving a polite chuckle in response. Oh to imagine that all he'd have to do now would be to suck up to the professors and not get in trouble. This truly was the best one could hope for.\n\nAt least, that was what he had thought would happen. An hour into the three-hour class, he realised that he had drifted off in thought and tried to shake his head to clear it.

After having gone hungry and homeless for so long, it was like tasting heaven. It was just a meal though, and he knew he couldn't rely on getting it tomorrow. Now though, he wanted to savour it and ate with one foreleg wrapped around the bowl as if to protect it.\n\n"Is it good?" a voice asked and he looked up, seeing one of the zebras that were running the soup kitchen that had fed him had come up to him. He nodded and took another bite. "Mind if I sit?" The zebra, a large, beefy stallion, nodded towards the chair next to his and he hesitated for a second before shrugging. The zebra slipped down onto the chair and continued asking him questions. "You are a veteran, right? Do you have a place to stay?" He shook his head.\n\n"I'm sleep'n under a bridg'. Can't go 'nywher' else." He didn't like talking. Ever since the grenade he slurred when he spoke. All he wanted was to eat and at least fall asleep with a full stomach. He had little more to hope for these days. At least the zebra was quiet for a few seconds now.\n\n"Did you know they're opening a spice processing plant in the city?" he asked, "They've said that veterans are getting dibs on work there, no matter what side you fought for. Would you like me to put in a word for you?" The question left him stopping mid bite. He put down the spoon as he stared down into the stew, not quite daring to believe what he had heard.\n\n"I jus' wan'ed food... "I don'... you don'." He shook his head. This wasn't really happening, was it? He was supposed to have lost everything, condemned to pass away in some back alley as a broken husk of a zebra.

"...and you try to tell us that slaving away in the factory is the same whether it's in the middle of the night, or it's daytime? I'm coming home to a kid that's already off for school, and by the time he's back, I'm out the door to go back here! If that's how it's going to be, you'll be paying more for it, or you can forget any worker taking your night shifts!"\n\n"The work is the exact same, and you are paid for the work you do." One of the suit-wearing zebras on the other side snapped back. "You are free to leave and find employment elsewhere if that is not acceptable."\n\n"So you can find those desperate enough to take the shifts without extra compensation, and who you can dismiss without a question when they don't accept being treated like animals?!" The burly zebra stopped now as a mare beside him put a hoof on his shoulder he fell quiet, letting her take over.\n\n"The issue here is not the nature of the job, it's the strain it puts on the workers. As he says, zebras are not able to be with their families, they spend their lives toiling away in the night and when the sun comes, they'll be fast asleep. You're out of synch with most of society when you're on the night shift, it's not something you can for long. You could just as well be stuck on a deserted island for how much time you can spend with friends and family."\n\nThe suit-wearing zebra was close to throwing up his hooves and calling it quits. One thing after another, these workers were never happy. Still, he knew that if he did, they'd go on strike. With the current government, they'd be out of luck with getting police help, and it'd all be down to who could outlast the other. How he missed the good old days..."

More important is what you are willing to offer for this controversy." Taking of his glasses and polishing them with a slow sigh, Zorrzel nodded in response to the question.\n\n"That would indeed be the pertinent issue, would it not? Very well then, as it seems that the gods have decided to place me in the unfortunate position of being the last leader of the Zarcid forces I... well my surrender should obviously be a foregone conclusion, but in addition to that I wish to offer my services to your National Unity Front, in whatever capacity I might be useful."\n\n"What are your terms?"

Forget dusty typewriter, he appeared more like some plant that had been taken out of the archives where he belonged, and would wilt utterly unless brought back into the musty darkness.\n\n"Oh, no terms at all. I have no real bargaining power at the moment, and I am left throwing myself at your hooves to plead for mercy even though I know that it'll cause a stir in your own ranks.\n\n"Eh, as I said I've always gone for the controversial option," Zeshmunazash smirked as he reached out a hoof to Zorrzel.

Earlier, he had believed himself resigned to his fate, believing that this bandit had fought for a good cause. Now, it was a bit more nerve-wracking. Seeing the building in which they were to meet, he was confused. It was just a farmhouse, he had expected either a fancier building or some shack for them to meet. But this was a family farm, as his back home! Entering, he was hit with a pungent aroma. Was that... apples? \n\n"Ey, comrade! Over here!" Zeshmunazash turned to the noise, and looking to his left, he saw a truly shocking sight. A zebra lounged back in a rocking chair, a full mustache, and held what looked like a liquor bottle. "Don't just stand there, friend, sit, sit!" As Zeshmunazash began to step towards the table, the zebra flashed a smile at him and said, "Come on, I don't bite... often." before chuckling lightly. \n\nAs Zeshmunazash sat, an old female zebra entered the room from the side carrying a pie, the source of the apple smell. Becoming suddenly stiff, Zeshmunazash soon saw the old woman was not a fighter. Turning to the zebra, he said sarcastically, "Zidon, I thought we agreed on no other soldiers in the room." Zidon turned back to him and chuckled, "My dear friend, this isn't one of my soldiers. This is-" "I mean the pie does look lethally good," Zesh interrupted. Staring at him for a second, Zidon continued, "This is Mama Manzana, a charity worker. She is letting me use her farmhouse for our get-together. That's all." Smiling again, Zidon pushed a plate towards Zeshmunazash as well as a glass. "Drink, eat! We are meant to be friends here, no?" He then bent down beside him and picked up a thatch farmer's hat, placing it on his head, "I hope you didn't think this would be one of those boring political conferences." Zeshmunazash smiled, "I like your style Zidon. So tell me, why is a fighter like you talking to a politician like me. You revolted for years. Are you sure you're ready to put down the rifle?"\n\nZidon thought for a moment, then spoke, "Why would I fight when what I have fought for is already here? I've been fighting for years for my comrades and friends to get a fair shot in life. To work their land and live happy, content lives, and look where we as a nation are now! The oligarchs are gone, and I've read your plans many times. I really couldn't ask for more for the zebras of this land! So when you approached me, I was thrilled that I would get the chance to meet you. I don't want to fight anymore. I want to live."\n\nZeshmunazash smiled wide now, "Well, friend, let's get down to business first. Then, I'll gladly take you up on the drinks and pie." Zidon laughed loudly and fully, "Bussiness first kind of zebra then? Alright, I can work with that. But I always open deals with a toast, so..."

### Leader Descriptions ###
CVA_ZESHMUNAZASH_ZEIRUTID_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 5th of Janurary, 964 in Kizil-Zeb\n\nBorn to a family of well-off farmers, Zeshmunazash Zeirutid seemed to many to be destined for greatness. A highly intelligent and charismatic young zebra, he excelled in school and could have risen high, maybe even raise the Zeirutid family up among the patricians. It could have happened, were it not for his persistent and uncompromising need for fairness.\n\nHis parents had instilled in him a belief in helping your neighbours, and when local landlords began to seize the farmlands in the region, Zeshmunazash were among those who protested the seizures. As 'legal' as they might be, all he saw was a distant senate who did not listen to its people, and let greedy landowners run roughshod over them. As it turned out, the landowners had enough power to not only have the protests violently dispersed, but also brand the organisers as criminals. At eighteen years of age, Zeshmunazash became an outlaw, and fled into the wilds. Harsh action provokes a strong reaction, however, and Zeshmunazash became determined to bring down the corrupt landlords with whatever means necessary.\n\nThough there may be strong similarities between him and figures like Steel Stallion and Filip Redglad, Zeshmunazash has never quite bought into the mainstream socialist ideas, and instead has created his own brand of the revolution. He still believes Colthage can be saved, but not as long as the Zarcids hold sway, and not as long as the elites are allowed to do as they please. He did not want to become an outlaw, and he did not want to be a leader, but that is the price to pay so that his fellow farmers can grow their crops without fear of being driven from their homes, then he'll happily pay it.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Sesek"
