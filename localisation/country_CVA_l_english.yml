CVA_CTH_fixing_whats_broken:0 "In Zeshmunazash's Memory" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_fixing_whats_broken_desc:0 "Through the fire and the storm we have fought. Despite the trials, and despite the loss of our beloved leader, we came out on top. Now, at the founding of the great Colthaginian Federation, Zarishat Zeirutid addresses the nation to honor the memory of her dear brother."
CVA_CTH_a1:0 "Punish The Landlords" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a1_desc:0 "Our struggle was born in the farmlands of Coltva thanks to the rapacity of the landlords, and though the path was long, we now are in a position to deal with them for good. No more shall they exploit the common zebra, for today is the day of reckoning!"
CVA_CTH_a2:0 "Target The Scientific Clique" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a2_desc:0 "The Scientifics are still out there, and though they are beaten, they are not yet broken. Unless we make sure to deal with them on a more permanent basis, we will not be able to rest on our laurels. They had their chance, history judged them wanting, and now they pay the price. "
CVA_CTH_a3:0 "Anti-Intellectual Proscriptions" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a3_desc:0 "The republic was in the end little more than a playground for ivory tower intellectuals to engage in endless quibbling as they invented a million forms of reactionary pseudo-ideologies. Yet, there's an equally misguided as widespread pride in this system, and it will not be easily uprooted." 
CVA_CTH_a4:0 "Starites In Our Midst" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a4_desc:0 "Of all the movements that has taken hold in the federation, the Starites must be the most insane of them all. Between their weird esoteric beliefs, their secrecy and utter and complete lack of anything resembling mercy or restraint, they seem more akin to a fever dream than an actual movement. They are real though, and they will need to be dealt with."
CVA_CTH_a5:0 "Tackling The Famine" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a5_desc:0 "Thanks to the chaos of these last years, malnutrition and starvation runs rampant. Between corruption, devastation, mismanagement and seemingly sheer malice, we are not producing even nearly enough to feed the people. This must be addressed, and fast."
CVA_CTH_a6:0 "Redefine The Plan Of Kizil-Zeb" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a6_desc:0 "The Kizil-Zeb Plan saw many successes in Coltva, but Zarishat is unconvinced that it is what the federation needs. The time to make concessions is long since past, and if the lack of a gentle hoof means the reactionaries will be more willing to resist... well isn't that killing two birds with one stone?"
CVA_CTH_a7:0 "Karamane Plantation Collectivisation" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a7_desc:0 "The rubber plantations in southern Zition have long been a cash cow for the state, even if more and more of it has been bought up by private interests. This will be rectified, and the its resources will once more belong to the people."
CVA_CTH_a8:0 "Zeordu Farmland Consolidation" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a8_desc:0 "in Coltva, the land reforms could be steadily carried out over a long time. Now, we will act decisively and swiftly. Zeordu will be the first to be transformed as we carry out our land reforms in one blow. It will be a messy affair, but the lessons learned will allow us to carry our further reforms going ahead with much greater ease."
CVA_CTH_a9:0 "Restructure The Textile Industry" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a9_desc:0 "Colthage's textile industry was born out of an attempt to compete with the Maregyptians' cotton, and it was decently successful at this. A plan has been proposed by Zillquat Zaladid, a former technocrat who joined the socialist cause, under which this industry can be brought into the fold and expanded both."
CVA_CTH_a10:0 "Corrective Labour" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a10_desc:0 "Clemency is a luxury, and luxuries are the mark of the bourgeoisie. Those who fought against us are too many to do away with, but that doesn't mean we can't make sure that they pay us back for the troubles they caused us through toil and sweat."
CVA_CTH_a11:0 "The Work For Bread Program" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a11_desc:0 "The famine must be dealt with posthaste, and as a part of it, a program has been put forth under which food items will constitute valid payment for labour. There are precious few who are not struggling to feed themselves, and this will not only free up monetary resources, but also mitigate their hunger."
CVA_CTH_a12:0 "A Ban On Usury" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a12_desc:0 "The amount of zebras trapped in debt by scheming moneylenders and banks is nothing short of obscene, and the remedy is simple. From this day forward, charging interest will be outlawed completely, and those who have charged too high interest will be forced to pay back said interest."
CVA_CTH_a13:0 "Department Of National Agricultural Organization" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a13_desc:0 "With the tumultous land reforms that have been carried out recently, we will have to make sure to keep clear records of who owns what land, and redistribute it as needed to ensure maximum production. Farmers shall own their lands, true, but the state will administer its distribution."
CVA_CTH_a14:0 "Industrial Reconstruction" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a14_desc:0 "The colthaginian industrial sector is much like its agricultural one; infested with oligarchs and monopolists. As we've started to deal with the issue of the famine, we can now turn our gaze to this field and ensure that the industrial sector is brought in line with the revolutionary ideals as well."
CVA_CTH_a15:0 "Agricultural Quotas" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a15_desc:0 "If the famine shall be defeated, all must give all they can. We can trust in our revolutionary brothers, but there are many farmers who might not be as motivated. If they will not act out of revolutionary zeal, they will simply have to act out of legal obligation as we implement strict quotas to be met."
CVA_CTH_a16:0 "Penal Worker Settlements" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a16_desc:0 "The thousands of reactionaries who now pay off their debt to the federation through labour can be found all over Colthage. In order to make the most of them, it is for the best that we concentrate them to special settlements where work is plenty and security is high."
CVA_CTH_a17:0 "National Department Of Labour" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a17_desc:0 "The labour produced by our people is a precious resources, not to be squandered. Yet the supply and demand is also unevenly distributed. Ozid has spearheaded the creation of a department dedicated to making sure that wherever there is a job that needs doing, we will find someone able to do it."
CVA_CTH_a18:0 "Selective Charity" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a18_desc:0 "The state cannot do everything, and at times, private interests can be helpful. We should encourage and support private initiatives, but that doesn't mean we can't make sure to aid those charities who are friendly to us, and hinder those who have ideas we don't approve of."
CVA_CTH_a19:0 "Restructure The Academia" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a19_desc:0 "The colthaginian institutes of higher learning have a long and proud history, but they are also a fertile breeding ground for technocrats and other counter-revolutionaries. In order to ensure the security of our nation, we will simply have to reorganise them in order to ensure our students learn the right lessons."
CVA_CTH_a20:0 "The Future Of The Nation" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a20_desc:0 "Our universites have been reorganised and expanded, and they are now ready to educate the next generation of federation leaders and scientists."
CVA_CTH_a21:0 "Mass Reindustrialisation" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a21_desc:0 "The age of famine and poverty is coming to an end. Thanks to the efforts of our people and the leadership of our government, we are reaching a point where our industry is well and truly restored to the level of its glory days."
CVA_CTH_a22:0 "Social Justice" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a22_desc:0 "None shall be left behind, and none shall feel like they are ignored by our nation. This is our pledge to the people of the federation, no matter their race or their ancestry."
CVA_CTH_c1:0 "Going Cold Turkey" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c1_desc:0 "Alcohol doesn't ask questions or comment on how your brother is such a shining exemplar. It doesn't make you feel inadequate or force you to live in the shadows of others. It's been her comfort for so long, and gods she will miss it..."
CVA_CTH_c2:0 "Work With Bandolier" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c2_desc:0 "Zannido Zidon is a menace like few, but he is not completely unreasonable. Though he's infamous in most of the country, the prefecture of Zidon views him as a hero. Maybe we should consider working with him? Though it'd be deeply unpopular to many, it'd bring the northwest into our fold as well as give us a talentet general."
CVA_CTH_c3:0 "We Have No Need For Bandits" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c3_desc:0 "Zannido Zidon is a bandit and a murderer. He has no place in the federation except in the deepest dungeon! We have pledged to be the leaders of this land, and how would it look if we bargained with his ilk?"
CVA_CTH_c5:0 "Committee Of Public Salvation" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c5_desc:0 "It'd be naive in the extreme to think that just because we won, the nation will be behind us. Our top priority right now should be to make sure that we give the people safety from all those who would tear down that which we are building."
CVA_CTH_c6:0 "Streamline The Judicial Process" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c6_desc:0 "We will stand behind justice, but we cannot be bogged down in procedure while we do so. Greater weight given to witnesses loyal to our cause, making the defendants defend themselves and similar policies will allow us to expedite the process."
CVA_CTH_c7:0 "Bureaucratic Reconstruction Effort" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c7_desc:0 "The old bureaucracy left from before our victory is not inherently broken. It can still serve us as long as we make sure to pay special heed to flush out any leftover loyalists. That way, the people can still interact with the old familiar institutions, even though it inwardly is rebuilt from the ground up. "
CVA_CTH_c8:0 "The Anti-Constitutionalist Decree" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c8_desc:0 "Some would have considered the Constitutionalists allies, but that was before the death of Zeshmunazash. They proved their true mettle then, and we have not forgotten. Yet at the same time, they are not a threat like the technocrats. Their party will be outlawed and they will be thrown in jail, but we will leave it at that."
CVA_CTH_c9:0 "A Bullet For The Fascists" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c9_desc:0 "When you are dealing with a disease, equivocating or waffling around will only hurt you even more. Fascism was born as the worst reaction to the revolution, and they shall be exterminated, lest their twisted ideology takes root once again."
CVA_CTH_c10:0 "A Bayonet For The Patricians" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c10_desc:0 "The elites have sat in their mansions and estates for centuries, preening mightily above the heads of the common worker. They think they can scramble to secure their position in the new order as well, but we wil lteach them the folly of their ways. "
CVA_CTH_c11:0 "Mass Property Re-Acquisition" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c11_desc:0 "The elites had built their tiny fiefdoms across Colthage, and unimaginable wealth had been gathered here. These great properties, built on the backs of the exploited, will be reclaimed by the people's state so that those who worked to build it may reap the fruits of their work. "
CVA_CTH_c12:0 "Restore Order In Hippone" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c12_desc:0 "The Starites have been allowed to run rampant for too long. With stability slowly returning in the heartland, we can now march east and show them that a bunch of jesters in gas masks are no match for the strength of the people!"
CVA_CTH_c13:0 "Restore The Hippone Territorial Fleet" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c13_desc:0 "The starites' rampage left our naval assets in the region beached and used for other purposes. Thankfully, the damage is not that severe. With sufficient work, we can restore this important part of our navy to its prime.  "
CVA_CTH_c14:0 "The Semblance Of Normalcy" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c14_desc:0 "It's come step by step, but news of fighting are getting rarer. Arrests and interrogations are getting more uncommon and the bureaucracy is back up and running. All of a sudden, it feels like it's over."
CVA_CTH_b1:0 "Revolutionary Conscription" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b1_desc:0 "Though the war is over, we are not safe yet, and if we are to ensure the integrity of our federation we must have an army up to the task. The shattered remnants of Colthage's army might well have what we're looking for. If we make sure to sift away ideologues and fanatics, many of them simply wish to fight for their home."
CVA_CTH_b2:0 "Military Worker Brigades" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b2_desc:0 "Our army consists of tens of thousands of able-bodied and highly organised zebras. While there is no war going on they would be better off assisting our rebuilding efforts. Not only will this aid recovery efforts, but it will also help those lacking faith in the revolutionary cause to build respect for the workers."
CVA_CTH_b3:0 "The Modern Liberation Army" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b3_desc:0 "Militias and guerillas might have been where we started, but we will need something more going ahead. War is an industry these days, and we must apply all our efforts towards industrialising our army. "
CVA_CTH_b4:0 "Basic Combat Roles" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b4_desc:0 "Not every zebra will serve the same purpose in battle. Some will shoot, others will dig, others will patch wounds and yet others will handle reconnaissance. This divison of martial labour will strengthen our forces immensely."
CVA_CTH_b5:0 "Alchemical Proliferation" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b5_desc:0 "The old traditions of alchemy have never gone away, and under us they will flourish. If we make sure that all our units have ready access to the skills and materials needed, they will become stronger in a way only zebras can truly be for it.  "
CVA_CTH_b6:0 "Rifle Standardisation" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b6_desc:0 "The fewer unique parts to an item, the easier it is to produce. Leaving behind the rag-tag armament of our coltvan days, we will now have one standardised rifle across the entirety of our military and police."
CVA_CTH_b7:0 "Reinforce Officer Preorgative" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b7_desc:0 "As much as the OARA is a valued asset, they cannot be allowed to run roughshod over the military. That'd create a cadre of sycophants instead of the able officers' corps we need."
CVA_CTH_b8:0 "Expand The Revolutionary General Staff" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b8_desc:0 "We are sorely lacking in capable officers, and we must make sure to rectify this. Thankfully, General Monzano has given us a list of promising candidates who are not only loyal to the revolution, but also capable commanders. "
CVA_CTH_b9:0 "The Red Chargers" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b9_desc:0 "The red flag is carried forth by the brave and the true, and it is only right that we form elite cadres to truly lead the way. Those who thought us mere rebels hiding in the woods shall soon find themselves crushed under the hooves of our most elite red chargers."
CVA_CTH_b10:0 "Officer Professionalisation" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b10_desc:0 "To be an officer is a difficult task, and it is wrong to expect it to be done by volunteers who happened to be more popular among their squadmates. Those who take up the task of leadership should be held to the highest professional standards, and be compensated thereafter."
CVA_CTH_b11:0 "Basic Mechanisation" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b11_desc:0 "Even the fastest zebra cannot outrun a modern vehicle, and if we make sure our soldiers are mounted on these vehicles we can redeploy them must faster and without the exhaustion that a long forced march would lead to."
CVA_CTH_b12:0 "Masters Of Metallurgy" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b12_desc:0 "We zebras were the first to forge metal, and yet across the world there are those who would presume themselves our betters. Reaffirming our mastery is not only a patriotic duty, but also sound military thinking. "
CVA_CTH_b13:0 "Pacify The Zebinop Countryside" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b13_desc:0 "Zarza really does not know when to quit. He has rampaged through Zebinop for too long, and his tenacity shows that the only way to stop him will be through bullets. Fortunately, he does not have the kind of armies he once commanded under him, so deploying in force will allow us to end the threat."
CVA_CTH_b14:0 "Masters Of Alchemy" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b14_desc:0 "Alchemy, foundation of modern chemistry, the first joining of magic and science. It is a mark of pride for many zebras, and the federation will not lag behind in developing these arts. "
CVA_CTH_b15:0 "Our Dignity Restored" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b15_desc:0 "The countless threats to the federation has been steadily pushed back, and though we are not done yet, we are in a position where none can truly question our status as the rightful rulers of colthage."
CVA_CTH_b16:0 "National Pacification Campaign" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b16_desc:0 "With the main threats to the federation crushed, we can now turn our attention to the myriad other factions ranging from protestors to bandit groups. If they lay down their arms and surrender that is good. If they refuse to the end we will not hesitate. One way or another, we will have peace again."
CVA_CTH_b17:0 "The Office Of Anti-Reactionary Activities" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b17_desc:0 "Not all threats to the revolution will be overt such, and if we hope to create true stability, we must be mindful of the threats that might seek to subvert our armed forces. The OARA will keep a close eye on them to ensure that they remain faithful."
CVA_CTH_b18:0 "The Federal Territorial Guard" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b18_desc:0 "The countryside is vast, and there is everything from roving monsters to counter-revolutionaries hiding out there. The FTG will be our weapon here, well armed and motivated soldiers who can uphold law and order in the countryside and protect those who live there from aggression of any kind." 
CVA_CTH_b19:0 "OARA Field Officer Department" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b19_desc:0 "The OARA's work never ends, and the military is of particular interest. Integrating OARA officers into the military hierarchy will ensure that this structure never can be compromised."
CVA_CTH_b20:0 "Police Militarisation" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b20_desc:0 "With the rapid progress made, and with tonnes of surplus weapons left after the revolution, there are many dangers facing our officers of the law. We cannot trust in batons to solve the challenges they will face; they will need proper arms and training."
CVA_CTH_the_revolution_secure:0 "Evolve The Revolution" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_the_revolution_secure_desc:0 "The policies of Zarishat and her advisors have secured peace and prosperity once again. Rising above all the forces that stood against her, she is now the heart and soul of the colthaginian revolution, and she knows what lies next for the nation."

colthaginian_federation.1.t:0 "On The Shoulders Of A Giant" #Sweet
colthaginian_federation.1.d:0 "The sun was too bright, the crowd too loud, and the gentle breeze did nothing to stop her headache. Zarishat took a deep breath as she held onto the pulpit, feeling her mouth water weirdly and a wave of nausea came over her. At least, her quickly covering her mouth and looking down probably came across as grief, and she swallowed to push the nausea down.\n\n"Fellow comrades of the revolution," she began, her voice raspy from the night before. "I never expected to be standing here before you today. This was meant to be my brother's moment... like everything else in life. He always stood there, shining like he was so much better than everyone else and-and we are all left weeping over his death." It was an exertion to correct herself, as all she wanted to do was to puke bile all over that self-righteous, arrogant pig she had endured her entire life. Getting back on topic, she continued with more fervor.\n\n"But I promise you, comrades of the struggle, that we are not stopping here. We are not quitting the struggle, indeed we have only begun! The revolution marches forward, and we shall complete my brother's labours! We shall punish those who ended his life, as we shall bring justice down upon those who have exploited and oppressed us for so long! The revolution lives!" She finished, actually managing to cry out and raise one hoof up to the air and provoke a thunderous response from the onlookers. It all kept going for way too long, and when she finally got off the stage she shook her head in exhaustion.\n\nShe had a chance right now, a chance unlike anything she'd ever imagined possible. With her brother out of the picture, she was the one they looked to for leadership, and if she didn't seize this opportunity, she'd never see anything like it again. Who'd have thought the best thing her brother could do for her was to die..."

colthaginian_federation.2.t:0 "The Generalissimo" 
colthaginian_federation.2.d:0 "News are trickling in from from Zebinop-Amanesya, where the old order has come roaring back. We had thought Zarza was dealt with, but he evidently isn't down for the count yet. Along with a cadre of loyalists and allies, he has seize the region, cut Colthage in two and caused chaos. His army is deeply dug in across the hilly region, and attempts to dislodge them have already failed. If we are to disloged that zebra, it'll take resources we don't have right now." 
colthaginian_federation.2.a:0 "Why couldn't he have just died?"

colthaginian_federation.3.t:0 "The Star Father's Children" 
colthaginian_federation.3.d:0 "Hippone has fallen.\n\nWhat information we have is disjointed and sometimes contradictory, but whawt we do know is that militants have seized the Hippone region. They are seemingly not connected to any of the factions we have contended with so far, and instead seem connected to the local patricians somehow. Wherever these masked figures come from though, they have quickly established a hard grip over the region. They are numerous and well armed, and the best we have managed to achieve is to contain them in Hippone, for now."
colthaginian_federation.3.a:0 "Who are these people even!?"

colthaginian_federation.4.t:0 "The Political Mosquitoes" #Sweet
colthaginian_federation.4.d:0 "It seems the Consitutionalists are determined to continue defying us. While their power has been broken, it's not fully gone yet, and they are hard at work to try to rally support against the Zarishat government. Their junior members — especially those that were allowed to remain on their posts after our takeover, have been relentlessly harrying us, attempting to sway our leaders with speeches and negotiations. Those senior members that we chased out of the government are out there working the government, trying to rally popular support for their ideas as well.\n\nThat they, even after all that they have done, would presume to speak for the common zebra would be amusing, if it were not so annoying. Thankfully they are still weakened, and it is unlikely they will be a real threat instead of just a headache." 
colthaginian_federation.4.a:0 "Hah! As if they're actually relevant!"

colthaginian_federation.5.t:0 "The Landlords"
colthaginian_federation.5.d:0 "Nursing a small headache, Zarishat stared listlessly at the list in front of her. This should be a moment of triumph, the moment that they dealt with the landlords and the patricians that had tormented the workers of Colthage for so long, but all she felt about it was exasperation. Couldn't they just have run out and started lynching zebras left and right, and then they could rein in the worst excesses? No, apparently not. It seemed like she had to take charge even here. \n\nIn Coltva, they had worked slowly and steadily, but now it would all come crashing down at once not the least thanks to the vicious war that had brought them here. Now, they would have to deal with their enemies all at once, and she really didn't care much for dealing with this. No matter the call, she'd piss important zebras off.\n\nThey had to be firm, that much she understood, but going after the technocrats alone wouldn't do it. The zebras under her wanted blood, and the constitutionalists hadn't done themselves any favour. Maybe it'd be for the best to target them as well, and truly bring the wrath of the revolution and all that down on their heads? It's cause a lot of unrest, but it'd give her army what they wanted. Of course, she could just play nice, blab something about moving forwards and minimize the retaliation against them.\n\nWhatever she did, she had to make a call though. Just make the call, then she could go and get a drink..."
colthaginian_federation.5.a:0 "Both the Constitutionalists and the Technocrats shall know our wrath!"
colthaginian_federation.5.b:0 "Zarza and his cronies shall be punished."
colthaginian_federation.5.c:0 "Let's play the 'moving forwards together' angle..."

colthaginian_federation.6.t:0 "Tea Time With Monzano" #Sweet
colthaginian_federation.6.d:0 ""So... what do you think you are trying to accomplish with this stunt?" General Monzano sat leaned forwards, staring Zarishat down. Zarishat, meanwhile, just wanted to throw the general out but refrained from it. She needed Monzano, and she wasn't in a position to throw away the sole general of the Coltvan armed forces she actually was on good terms with. It didn't make her any less annoying right now though.\n\n"I was trying to throw them a bone, give them something little so they can see that we're not going to hang them all indiscriminately."\n\n"You backed down in a moment of triumph," Monzano continued. "You showed weakness, and they are going to pounce on this. And what of your comrades? They'll see their due retribution being cast aside, only getting this waffling about... what, harmony?"\n\n"I'm not going to turn into Celestia, and I'm not going to be weak," Zarishat snapped. "You want to see retribution and a firm hoof? You'll get it, just you wait and see. I gave them a little morsel now, but if they get snippy, they'll taste dirt!"\n\n"That is all I ask," Monzano nodded, mollified, and leaned back to raise her teacup. "To the federation.""

colthaginian_federation.9.d:0 "Zarishat didn't know what to do during the evenings if she didn't drink, nor did she really feel like her mornings were as they ought to if she wasn't nursing at least a dry mouth. It'd been going on for so long that it was just the way things were. It was natural, and at least the moments of inebriation provided some kind of comfort. It blocked out all the things she didn't want to deal with, and rested over her like a comforting blanket.\n\nOf course it was killing her, she didn't need zebras telling her that. Not that many of them would these days. She could drink as much as she jolly well wanted, and none would bother her, and that was why she had to end it here and now. This wasn't about what she desired, this was about what she had to do. She couldn't blame others for her hangovers and drunken evenings any longer. She'd had this position fall onto her out of sheer luck, but either she stopped now, or she'd slip up and share her brother's fate sooner or later.\n\nThat was why she stood by the sink, pouring out every last bottle of alcohol she had, making sure to not breathe through her nose so the smell wouldn't tempt her. How long had she lasted before? A week maybe, two at one point. It was now or never though, and she grimaced as she finished pouring out the last bottle and put it on the counter. Pouring herself a mug of tea, she sipped it and instantly felt the desire to pour in some liquor as well. She could order someone to get her some whisky, that would fit perfectly.\n\nBut no, she was done. She fought back the urge and sighed. First urge puhed down, only a lifetime's worth of it left."

colthaginian_federation.11.d:0 "Zanno had never viewed his tenants as so many of the other landlords did. To him, they were not subjects for him to lord over or lessers that needed his firm hoof; they were his partners in tending to the land. Their poverty said nothing of their character, nor did his wealth. He preferred to be guided by his grandmother's last words; "I'd rather hear once of your kindness, than a thousand times of your wealth". It was hard at times, not the least when the Coltvan peasant uprising had come to his doors. Yet, he had submitted to their Kizil-Zeb plan, believing sincerely that it was the best way to keep peace, and that from his concession they all could move forward togehter.\n\nYet, it had become clear to him that he had been alone in that thought. While at first he had thought things would get better, those hopes were dashed as he looked down on the letter, which coldly informed him that he had one week to depart his property with only what he could carry, as the land he occupied was now considered property of the federation. He read it over and over, trying to comprehend what was going on. This couldn't be right, this wasn't what was meant to happen. He had cooperated, hadn't he? He was willing and ready to submit to the Coltvans' government, give up large parts of his property to help his fellow Zebras. Was this his thanks?!\n\nHe slowly put the letter down, moving as if he was in a trance as he walked out of his study. He had to get his family... they had to leave Colthage."

colthaginian_federation.12.d:0 ""Please sir, do you have any work for me?" The young mare asked as the door opened. She was weak and emaciated, her clothes tattered. "I'll work as hard as you need me to, I just need some food to-ack!" she exclaimed in surprise as she was dragged inside.\n\n"Well haven't you come to the right place!" the zebra that had met her in the door said as he took her inside. Zebras were everywhere inside the large country building, and they were hard at work moving things around the house. She was confused by it all, but didn't have much time to say anything before she was brought into the kitchen and had a large bowl of stew put down in front of her. "Here, eat! I'll talk while you eat."\n\n"See, we're rebuilding this place into an angricultural cooperative. After we chased out the landlords, there's plenty of fields for strong hooves to tend. Have you ever worked a farm?" the mare looked up from the stew she was scarfing down and nodded. "Then you will have more than a job here. We need as many as we can to help out. What do you think? Work, a home and food for as long as you're here, and you get a chance to aid in the revolution along your fellow comrades!"\n\nShe didn't have a clue what he was on about. Was this connected to all the fighting in the recent months? She'd been hiding in the mountains until it all died down, but now it seemed like she had missed something really big. She knew this wasn't a chance she could waste though, and she nodded fervently."

colthaginian_federation.13.d:0 ""Zaal-Zanit on a bisquit, this building's never getting finished, is it?" Rolling his head around to soften up his neck, the Zebra put his trowel away in the rack and walked down the half-finished stairs, over to the breadline. "Think we'll work here until the day we die?"\n\n"I hope so," his fellow worker said, "that way we don't have to worry about where to get food again."\n\n"I mean, I'd like to not do this when I'm sixty?" The first zebra shrugged, stepping forward as one worker after another was given a package of food. It was a long line, but thankfully things were moving quickly. There was no shortage of eager zebras willing to work just for a chance to feed their families, so there was little desire to cause a ruckus. Better to get your food and leave for the day, you didn't get much other work right now. By the time it was their turn, the two zebras accepted their packages and quickly stepped out of the way as they began heading home.\n\n"See you tomorrow," the zebra said, bidding his coworker farewell as he once again looked down into the package. As flippant as he was, this would feed both him and his wife and right now that was all that he needed."

Now was now, and he had concluded that boredom was underrated. Boredom meant you weren't getting shot at, and after the last months, he gladly settled for that.\n\nThe university was the same as it always had been, with some exceptions. As he walked toward the lecture hall, he noted that the old painting that once had hung in the corridor portraying to founders of Colthage was picked down, having been replaced with a painting of a farmer and a factory worker shaking hooves with a doctor and... well a lawyer he supposed. Probably hung up by the new government. At least the classes would be the same boring ones they had been before the war, with the same boring classmates.\n\nAs he entered and found a place, he looked forward to slipping down into teh familiar miasma of tedium, only to be surprised as the lecturer began by telling them that the curriculum had been revised, and that in addition they would be assigned a new bloc of classes. Schedules were passed around the classrom, and Zuan looked at it in befuddlement. "Socialist Theory", "Marksist Economic Theory", "Revolutionary History" and "International Economics" were all scattered across the semester schedule, and Zuan grimaced. It seemed like it wasn't going to be quite as boring as he'd hoped for."

colthaginian_federation.15.d:0 "Morning meetings were nothing new at the factory, but the workers couldn't remember it being quite as... zealous. An angry foreman was one thing, but the way the new one was standing in front of them, yelling about how they were soldiers on the front line of the socialist struggle, and how every day they fought here was one day that the nation might be spared the ravages of the reactionaries and the fascists. Few of them had been ardent socialists before the war, and those who were had gone away during the civil war.\n\nYet, it was inspiring all the same. Many of them had still been in the area when the war had swept through, and the artillery barrages had brought down large parts of the entire district. The fact that the socialists had managed to rebuild it so quickly was impressive, but it was also very clear that they weren't just simple workers any more. The new bosses took their work very seriously, which was nice on one hoof, but on the other... nozebra wanted to be the first to disappoint them. If they were 'soldiers' now, they'd have to deliver, that much was made quite clear, and if they had hoped for a return to a sedate life after the end of the war, that hope was thoroughly quashed."

colthaginian_federation.17.d:0 "Zimilco, once Captain Zimilco, admitted to himself that he really had been a naive zebra when he was young. Once, as the son of a wealthy patrician, he had idolized the life of the simple farmer. Rise at dawn, hard physical work to strengthen the body, the simple and straightforward existence of knowing exactly what you needed to do. What a foal he had been.\n\nRising up from his bunkbed as the bells rung outside, he groaned as he rolled his neck, feeling the pain in the left side of it. Still sore, and had been for three day now. All he had done was try to argue with the guards that his bunkmate was sick and couldn't work as hard as they wanted. That, apparently, made him deserving the baton to them. His bunkmate wasn't looking too cheery either. He was pale, and that infection on his leg didn't look good at all.\n\nUrging the young zebra to come with him, he walked outside to line up and receive the day's instructions from the camp commander. It was cold outside, and eh  The landscape where their camp lay was beautiful, that much he could admit, but it was kind of hard to see beyond the quarry, the high barbed wire fences and the guard towers. Once, he probably would have loved to go hiking in these hills. Now he and all the others would stare at them until the socialists were done with them, whenever that would be.\n\nHe hadn't given up yet though, he was not going to let them think he was broken. There were still soldiers who looked to him for leadership, or at least hope, and he still had a duty to them, even if the government he fought for was gone."

colthaginian_federation.18.d:0 "Zomilcar found himself doubting more and more these days. Not only had the civil war shaken a lot of his beliefs, the rise of the Zarishat regime had been worse than he had feared it would be. To think that he once had been carefully optimistic about Zeshmunazash, and argued that there could be and indeed should be rapprochement with the coltvan socialists. He'd already had to eat crow over that whole fiasco, and who knew what would happen next? At least there were still those who spoke out. As long as they did, perhaps the regime would realize they couldn't do whatever they pleased.\n\nSighing, he rose up from his desk to take a walk. At least he could swing by his favourite coffee shop and enjoy a cup before continuing to work. Stepping outside and locking the door, he nodded to the small group of his neighbours as he passed them by. They were standing by a corner and seemed to be reading some flyer, though he didn't much care to stop and chat with them about it. They were simple zebras, and he had enough on his mind already.\n\nHis neighbours looked quietly up from the flyer at him as he passed, and then down at it again. After a few seconds they nodded to each other and began after him. He was a prick anyway, and they needed the money. And besides, if they could make sure the new government knew of them as loyal citizens for having handed over a 'subversive intellectual' instead of harbouring one, then all the better."

These days, he was happy to find a bridge to sleep under without being chased away, and at least the hunger distracted him from the nightmares to some extent. Father, sergeant, hero, all those things he had been was gone after the civil war had taken everything from him, and right now shelter and food were the only things he could really think of. What else was there he could think of? At least the news of the soup kitchen in the west of the city had given him something to hope for, and he had slowly made his way there.\n\nAs it turned out, it was more than just a soup kitchen. It seemed to be an entire outdoor mess, and there were dozens of zebras waiting in line as they were given a large bowl of soup and bread. He quietly got in line, awed by the sight and daring for the first time to feel something resembling hope. Were they really offering help? Could he hope for a full belly?\n\nAs he drew nearer, he heard the zebras state their old units before they got the bowl and tried to think. It felt like an eternity ago, what had even been his unit? When he remembered it was his turn, and he told them '[INSERT COLTHAGE MILITARY UNIT HERE]', reaching out to accept his food only to have them freeze.\n\n"You're not getting fed her, traitor," the zebra spat. "Get out of here before I call the police."\n\n"Wh-wh..." He tried to protest. "M'not fightin. Can't... Don't want troubl..." he slurred, had done ever since that grenade, but the zebra didn't listen, instead turning to the side and calling for the police officers that were standing further away. The two came at him and he quickly stumbled away in fear, though not fast enough to avoid a blow before he got far enough away that they stopped pursuing him. Clutching the side of his head, he hurried away as the line began to move again, feeding the soldiers who deserved their help."

colthaginian_federation.20.d:0 ""Honorable Sufrit, I hope I am not interrupting, but we most certainly need to speak!" Ozid was livid. Zarishat could tell as the blubber around his neck was trembling as she sighed and asked what he wanted. "You have offered amnesty to Zannido Zidon, and I cannot for the life of me understand what made you think this was a good idea. That zebra is a criminal of the worst kind, and you're risking the entire reputation of the Coltvan cause when you align with that kind of zebra!"\n\n"Should we not be working together for the betterment of all, my dear Ovid?" Zarishat asked mildly, while in truth focusing on the way his neck wobbled.\n\n"Not a Zebra like that!" Ovid stopped, wiping his forehead as he tried to calm himself down. Zarishat meanwhile kept thinking about it, wondering if there was a rhyme there. "He is an unrepentant murderer, and the people need safety above all else. Seeing their saviours engage with that kind of zebras will make them wonder what we're up to. Our integrity is the most precious thing we have, and we must hold onto it!" Zarishat nodded slowly, as if she was understanding, but in truth she composed a little ditty in her head.\n\n'Fatty fatty boom-boom, sitting on the floor. Cannot leave the room-room, too big for the door' she thought before speaking up. "I've heard your complaints, and I'll take them under advisement, now if you'll excuse me..." she added a bit more sharply, Ovid taking another deep breath before nodded.\n\n"Of course, but please. We must remember that we're on the people's side, not the bandits," he said as he departed. Zarishat rolled her eyes as he left. Gods that zebra was a pest. Still, she needed him."

"Leaving aside all the unrest it would have caused to accept him, he would have been a headache to have as a general."\n\n"Really now? A capable general, loved in his home region, and you're this relieved?" Monzano shook her head in reply.\n\n"Militaries are build on obedience and procedure. While a certain person might have idealized them, they're uncontrollable and undisciplined. We have a chance to integrate the proper Colthaginian military, and the fact that you focus on them instead of that savage just proves you're the smarter zebra." Zarishat smiled at the comments, leaning back a little and soaking up the praise. This was why she liked Monzano. They saw eye to eye, and she knew to give praise when deserved."

Their crimes might not warrant death, but they have nevertheless sold the proletariat false hopes, and used them to further their own agendas.

Some would say they were even a tad addicting. At least enough so to put up with the process of getting through the darn security perimeter.\n\nAfter fumbling with his ID card within his coat, intentionally oversized to obscure his appearance and give him privacy, Zazarit gave it to the OARA guard who let him through into the Arabian sector. Buildings in the Sa'addle style replaced the Zonician realist structures, and horses in fancy robes contrasted the loyal OARA who stood guard. Anyone in here either had it in with Zarishat, or wasn't going to be here much longer.\n\nWeaving his way through the streets, Zazarit found his location, a sand brick building with purple cloth accenting the doorway. Entering inside, he trotted up a small flight of stairs before being hit with a wave of intoxicating smoke. On a cushion of purple satin in front of him was the Emir of Al'Nadieia, surrounded by a collection of three "companions," two mares and a stallion, wearing veils of the same purple.\n\n"Ah, my friend, welcome, have a seat!" the Emir said. Zazarit took him up on the offer, sitting down on a near-identical cushion on his side of the room, after which he was immediately approached by another stallion carrying a glass container full of smoke with a tube attached. Handing it to Zazarit, he took a puff and thanked the worker, who winked at him in return.\n\nTurning back to the Emir, Zazarit said, "I understand you wanted to talk about the deal? Has there been a change of plans? You know the party doesn't like surprises."\n\n"No, no, I just wanted to review the details one last time, Mr. Zazarit," the Emir said with a small smile. "Or should I call you Commissar? And plus, you're a fun stallion to be with! While most of your "comrades" are uptight when we talk, you know how to relax, to enjoy yourself."\n\nZazarit chuckled. "Well then, let's hammer it out as agreed. You get that contract from the party for the new governor's mansion. You reimburse the "party" for around half, and I get you exclusive rights to the coffee trade from the villages around Zebinop."\n\n"Everything does seem to be in order," the Arabian said, nodding slowly. "Tell you what. You've been such a good partner that I'll offer you something extra." He reached over and pulled back a curtain, giving a view of the rest of his "companion" employees. "Pick one, I'll have them moved to your new residence after it's built."\n\nZazarit smiled crookedly, muttering a single phrase under his breath. "Long live the Revolution.""

Only a year ago, when she still drank, it would have given her a bleating headache and one hell of a temper, but she was beyond that now. Fully sober and entirely centered on what she was about to do. She had to suppress a chuckle. This was a memorial, after all, a memorial to her "holier-than-thou" brother and his legacy of reform and growth. But look where he was now. Down in the dirt, out of her mane, and not here to complain about all the changes she was making.\n\nIt took her a while to think of how to best honor him, but with all the economic reforms she was making, Zarishat started to savor just how much he would despise her for it. His revolution built on communal ownership and devolution of property, swiped out of his grasp by the sister he could never appreciate. Then, it had hit her like lightning.\n\nSpeaking clearly into the microphone, Zarishat began her speech, "Citizens of Zonicia! Look how far we have come! From the days of the revolution, we are more prosperous and more enriched, we are more educated in the ways of the revolution, and we stand above the slavers and masters that once held us down! But we can not forget what we have lost, my brave brother, Zeshmunazash, who died for our freedom to be won." Zarishat spoke about her brother through gritted teeth, her speech included a section praising specific things he had done, but seeing how she could barely stammer out calling him "brave," she decided it would be best to toss it.\n\n"Thus, I have come to declare the opening of a new memorial to his memory, a symbol of our economic progress, the new Kizil-Zeb foreign consulate!" Behind her, a red cloth fell, revealing the new titan of a building. The red hammer of the revolution towering imposingly above the entrance, interlocked not with a horseshoe, but instead a golden coin, a perversion of everything that scumbag of a brother stood for. Zarishat knew she couldn't call her new stock exchange what it was, but just knowing the true purpose of the beacon of moneymaking that stood in front of her gave her a warm feeling of joy, as well as heaps of irony."
