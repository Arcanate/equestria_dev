 modern_theory:0 "Modern Naval Theory"
 modern_theory_desc:0 "With great battles behind us and lessons learned from them, the time has come to reexamine the best way to organize a fleet. The first order of business is ensuring every aspect of the fleet is ready to engage at any time and at any location it is required."
 modern_fleet:0 "Modern Fleet Manoeuvres"
 modern_fleet_desc:0 "The fleet needs to be able to separate into independent strike forces and then reunite for major battles. Training our sailors in how to achieve both objectives will open up new possibilities in naval warfare."
 submarine_escort:0 "Submarine Escort"
 submarine_escort_desc:0 "Submarines normally hunt convoys, but with the advent of powerful radar systems they can hunt each other. Wire-guided torpedos in turn allow the submarines to take on their enemy counterparts."
 missile_fundamentals:0 "Missile Warfare Fundamentals"
 missile_fundamentals_desc:0 "Missiles provide a new route for ship combat, letting us send payloads directly to the target. By having destroyers mark down the enemy location and missile position, we can correct errors in flight in real time."
 modern_capital_tactics:0 "Modern Capital Ship Tactics"
 modern_capital_tactics_desc:0 "It is no longer sufficient to have a fleet sitting in port doing nothing. Every ship is expected to do its part at all times, which means capital ships will have to adapt to many roles as the navy demands."
 surface_harassment:0 "Surface Harassment"
 surface_harassment_desc:0 "Small skirmishes let us wear the enemy down, keeping them constantly on the back hoof and unable to mount a strong offense. Using smaller fleets to tie up larger ones, we can divert the enemy away from more important tasks."
 missile_age_engagements:0 "Missile Engagements"
 missile_age_engagements_desc:0 "Missiles let even the smallest ship face down the heaviest. With the incorporation of missiles across the fleet, every ship becomes part of a distributed kill chain. From the destroyer to the battleship or carrier, everything that floats must be ready to destroy the enemy navy."
 cv_core_role:0 "Carrier Core Role"
 cv_core_role_desc:0 "The times are changing, and the carrier is right in the centre of it. Able to achieve air superiority on both land and sea, it is clear the carrier will be the most important part of the navy in the years to come."
 cruiser_primacy:0 "Cruiser Primacy"
 cruiser_primacy_desc:0 "As versatile as carriers are, they cannot function alone. They need a vast fleet of screening and support to aid them. New, faster cruisers will make up the bulk of our navy's tonnage."
 control_of_the_sea:0 "Control of the Seas"
 control_of_the_sea_desc:0 "Carriers project an awesome dominance simply from their presence. Bombers can sink ships long before the carriers even come into range. With our carrier fleet, no one will dare challenge us on the high seas."
 cv_support_role:0 "Carrier Support Role"
 cv_support_role_desc:0 "While carriers enjoy some benefits over other ships, they have just as many drawbacks. We cannot build a fleet upon them; instead, they will be reshuffled into a role befitting a specialized ship."

Pilots who previously could only report on the position of submarines now can fire depth charges and torpedos down at them, necessitating new experience and education."
 modern_sub_tactics:0 "Modern Submarine Tactics"
 modern_sub_tactics_desc:0 "Wolfpack tactics have proven incredibly useful. With new improvements, such as staggering our submarines and encircling an enemy from all sides, we can cut off any hope of escape and increase the chances of a hit."
 stalking:0 "Underwater Stalking"
 stalking_desc:0 "Sometimes it is advantageous not to attack right away, as what appears to be merely a destroyer on patrol may turn out to be scouting ahead for a juicy convoy. All submarines shall be instructed to always keep an eye out for better targets."
 long_duration_patrols:0 "Long Duration Underwater Patrols"
 long_duration_patrols_desc:0 "Every aspect of the submarine is centered around one core role, that of striking against vulnerable surface ships. By emphasizing the critical nature of this role and the dedication it takes, we can stretch food and fuel longer to truly hit anywhere in the world."

 tactical_focus:0 "Modern Strike Bombing"
 tactical_focus_desc:0 "Rather than diving onto an enemy to release a payload, a recent innovation has been to do a vertical loop over the target, releasing the bomb while pointed straight up. This will then fall directly on its target, offering higher accuracy than traditional dive bombing."

 strategic_focus:0 "Precision Bombing"
 strategic_focus_desc:0 "In sharp contrast to the blanket bombing of the past, which both caused excessive collateral damage and wasted precious bombs, the new approach is to emphasize hitting the correct target as reliably as possible. Radar, night-vision, and similar developments will make this possible."
 tactical_str_primacy:0 "Flexible Bomb Platforms"
 tactical_str_primacy:0 "We cannot specialize entirely into strategic bombing. Tactical bombers can perform whatever task is needed of them."
 str_primacy:0 "Strategic Bomber Primacy"
 str_primacy:0 "Ultimately every war is won or lost at the operational level. An enemy unable to supply its troops or equip them with guns will collapse inward with a swift kick. Therefore our strategic bombers will receive the best training available to maximize their power."
 vl_range_escorts:0 "Very Long Range Escorts"
 vl_range_escorts_desc:0 "It is not sufficient to have long-range bombers if they have no escorts to aid them. Therefore fighters and heavy fighters will be trained in conserving fuel as much as possible."
 retaliatory_strikes:0 "Retaliatory Strikes"
 retaliatory_strikes_desc:0 "Striking as enemy fighters are returning to their carriers to refuel will let us catch the carriers off-guard. Anti-air guns will struggle to target our planes when they are among the enemy's."
 aerial_refueling:0 "Aerial Refueling"
 aerial_refueling_desc:0 "By funneling fuel from one plane to another in-flight, we can dramatically increase their effective range."
 global_reach:0 "Global Reach"
 global_reach_desc:0 "Wherever our bombers are, they must be capable of reigning down destruction. Sufficiently powerful bombing can overcome any foe."
 round_the_clock_allert:0 "Round the Clock Alert"
 round_the_clock_allert_desc:0 "An enemy strike could occur at any moment. Therefore we must be able to deliver strikes of our own whenever required."
 basic_jet_operations:0 "Basic Jet Operations"
 basic_jet_operations_desc:0 "The incredible speed of the jet engine lets jet fighters easily outrun traditional props, or conversely chase them down with ease. This must be exploited."
 high_speed_engagements:0 "High Speed Engagement Tactics"
 high_speed_engagements_desc:0 "Learning to operate a plane at nearly the speed of sound is not easy. Our pilots will have to rise to the task."
 offense_in_depth:0 "Offense in Depth"
 offense_in_depth_desc:0 "Focusing on preemptive attacks, we can strike enemy fighters when they are taking off or landing, and at their most vulnerable."
 ground_directed:0 "Ground Directed Interception"
 ground_directed_desc:0 "Ground crews report in when a bomber takes off, and fighters are scrambled to intercept it before it can ever reach friendly airspace. Ground radar assists in locating any bombers that slip by."
 onboard_guidance:0 "Aerial Radar Searches"
 onboard_guidance_desc:0 "Getting the most out of onboard radar requires specialized training. But with the appropriate experience, our pilots can always be informed of the location of rival fighters."
 advanced_jet_tactics:0 "Advanced Jet Tactics"
 advanced_jet_tactics_desc:0 "Learning from our mistakes, we have developed more modern methods of avoiding the enemy. Radical methods such as cutting power to the engines can earn a surprise advantage."
 sam_integration:0 "Forward SAM Integration"
