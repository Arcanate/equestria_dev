 ### LEADER DESCRIPTIONS ###
 POLITICS_ZALATHEL_ZARCA_DESC:0 "The son of Zamilcar Zarca, former-head of the powerful Zarca family and longest serving Consul of Colthage, Zalathel grew up in Colthaginian high-society during a period of peace and prosperity, however that all changed when the Storm King attacked.\n\nDespite joining his father in the defence of the city, the Storm King's forces proved to be overwhelming and Zalathel was forced to flee with his two brothers. The zebra went high into the Ponytus Mountains to lead a resistance group that plagued the Storm King's occupation. When news of the Storm King's death reached him, Zalathel lead the attack on Colthage itself and executed its puppet governors. With the city secure he was met as a liberator by many, but quickly and brutally cracked-down on any opposition. He turned to the warlords that had risen up throughout Colthage and those who would not step into line where quickly taken out.\n\nNow the new Consul, he has enough strength and support to keep power, but his position is a precarious one. Only time will tell if he will continue the legacy of his father, the position he was groomed for."

 CTH_the_coltva_unrest_cat_desc:0 "During the Storm King's occupation, the eastern provinces of Coltva took to their mountains and fought a gurilla war against the occupiers. After liberation, the celebrations quickly turned sour as it became clear to the zebra who fought for freedom that they would return to being slaves and land serfs for the rich and powerful Colthaginian bosses. One rebel leader, Zeshmunazash Zeirutid, has manged to rally the zebra to his cause and is continuing his war of resistance against the Colthaginian government.\n\n§RIf we do not deal with the unrest in the region, this could spill over to be a full-blown rebellion.§!"

 CTH_the_constitutionalist_rebellion_cat_desc:0 "After the War of Liberation, the son of an influential west-Colthaginian land owner, Zanno Mzelqatid, directly contested Zalathel Zarca in the elections for the position of Sufrit. Despite the result having already been decided before the election, he still campaigned ad was able to gather significant support among the urban youth and the Popular Assembly. After the election, and Zalathel Zarca's overwhelming victory, he declared that the election was rigged and invalid. But before the authorities could crackdown on him for inciting unrest he and several supporters had fled across the border to Zumidia.\n\nWe cannot for a moment believe that this would be the end we see of him."


 ### EVENTS ###
 colthage_sicameon_murder.1.t:0 "A Murder in Scarlet"
 colthage_sicameon_murder.1.d:0 "Professor Balazar Zatid of the University of Colthage was found dead yesterday morning at an archaeological in the ancient Colthaginain colony of New Colthage located on the southern coast of the Scarlet. The professor was well renowned among the Colthaginian academic and archaeological communities and was a forerunner in early Colthaginian civilisation. He had travailed to the island of Scarlet to continue his work excavating the remains of the ancient Colthaginian town of New Colthage. Early reports say that he was found having been beaten, strangled, shot, and stabbed with his own pickaxe. Local authorities have yet to bring forth any suspects, but there is no doubt that this will spile into a major diplomatic incident between our two nations.\n\nColthage's ancient history in Griffonia has always been controversial to many Griffonians who reject the idea of any substantial Zebrican civilization on their continent, or even to meaningful interactions between our two worlds in the past. This flies in the face of complementary evidence that Professor Balazar Zatid and many others in both Colthage and Griffonia have uncovered, along with historical accounts and events, such as the famed Karthinian General Gripio Zebracanus who conquered the island of Scarlet for the Karthinian Republic over 1,500 years ago.\n\nSuch a crime has shocked the local community and the hunt for the perpetrators is still ongoing."
