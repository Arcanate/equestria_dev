 ### LEADER DESCRIPTIONS ###
 POLITICS_ZALATHEL_ZARCA_DESC:0 "As the son of Zamilcar Zarca, former-head of the powerful Zarca family and longest serving Consul of Colthage, Zalathel grew up in Colthaginian high-society during a period of peace and prosperity. However, all that changed when the Storm King attacked.\n\nDespite joining his father in the defence of the city, the Storm King's forces overwhelmed the defenders and Zalathel was forced to abandon Colthage with his two brothers. The zebra fled high into the Alaudid Range to lead a guerilla force to harass the Storm King's army as it continued to rampage in Northern Zebrica. When news of the Storm King's death reached him, Zalathel led the attack on Colthage itself and executed its collaborationist governors. With the city secure, he was seen as a liberator by many, but did not hesitate to crackdown on any opposition to his faction. He turned to the warlords that had risen up throughout Colthage and those who would not step into line where quickly taken out.\n\nNow the new Sufrit, he has enough strength and support to keep power, but his position is a precarious one. Only time will tell if he will continue the legacy of his father, the position he was groomed for."
 POLITICS_ZANNO_MZELQATID_DESC:0 "Zanno Mzelqatid is a son of a landowning well-off family in Western Colthage. He attended university in Wingbardy thanks to a government exchange program and there he became part of the ever growing urban middle class that read republican Griffon literature and spoke out against the Zarcid regimen as an affront to Colthage's Republican traditions.\n\nIn 1006 as the war of independence was dying down, Zanno travelled around the nation gathering support from the recently freed Zebra to campaign for an end of Zarcid tyranny and promised them true political and economic reform. All that had to be done was for them to make their voices heard to the senate. Unfortunately this led to Zanno being arrested a week before the senate voted Zarathal Zarca in as Sufrit. Zanno was eventually released from prison on bail, but managed to make his way across the border into the Hippogriff-run Zebrican Mandate where he declared the election as illegitimate and began gathering supporters.\n\nPersonally, he is often seen as aloof and often not in touch with reality. In Wingbardy he ended up becoming a fan of Spiritism and believes he is a medium who can talk to the dead and magical spirits. He believes the spirit of his dead brother visited him and told him to dedicate his life to helping others, and to never drink alcohol or smoke. He is also a strong believer in homeopathy over magical or clinical medicines. Regardless, he is well liked by people he meets and is held in high regard by the employees of his plantations. He introduced sweeping education, medical, and social reforms for the plantation and the nearby towns, building schools and hospitals (staffed by actual doctors thankfully). He is against slavery and the semi-official class system in the nation and wishes to see a true liberal democratic Colthage."

 ### FOCUS ###
 CTH_zarcid_legacy:0 "Lean on the Zarcid Legacy"
 CTH_zarcid_legacy_desc:0 "The Zarca family is more than just a powerful political family. To many Colthaginians, the Zarcids are exemplars of the power and glory of the country's history. By invoking the family name, we will be able to appoint some loyalists to important bureaucratic positions, which should allow us some political momentum to deal with the hampered economy and the unrest in the provinces."

 CTH_bread_or_stick_politics:0 "Bread or Stick Politics"
 CTH_bread_or_stick_politics_desc:0 "Zamilcar Zarca's bread or stick politics was an informal system of patronage. Less influential chiefs, landowners and other community leaders would get bread or other help for their people in return for backing Zamilcar whenever he needed them while those who refused would be forced out of politics. The Storm King broke a lot of these informal bonds, and it will take time to reforge them."

 CTH_reintroduce_poltical_chiefs:0 "Reintroduce Political Chiefs"
 CTH_reintroduce_poltical_chiefs_desc:0 "The regional divides of Colthaginian society are not a new phenomenon. Zamilcar Zarca dealt with this problem by assigning political chiefs, a local office used to undermine dissidents, which proved effective in the hinterlands. When we lost political control under the Storm King, the system collapsed, but we can bring the chiefs back from retirement to reassert control over the countryside."
 
 CTH_reinforce_the_western_garrisons:0 "Reshuffle the Western Garrisons"
 CTH_reinforce_the_western_garrisons_desc:0 "Guarding the border with Hippogriff occupied Zumidia has been regarded as an easy assignment for years. The zebra in the area are usually loyal, unlike the meddlesome Coltvans. However, rumours of Zanno's return have fired up the local youth and the lazy garrison is doing nothing to stop their rallies. Replacing the garrison with veterans from Coltva will teach these kids the strength of Colthage."

 CTH_crackdown_on_the_western_bandits:0 "Crackdown on Western Bandits"
 CTH_crackdown_on_the_western_bandits_desc:0 "The lazy western garrisons have let bandits fester in the west, making us look weak and aiding the Maharzaalid movement. With real soldiers now stationed in the area, we can begin to root out the criminals and restore order to the land. Our new political chiefs will investigate bandit strongholds, so we can decisively rid ourselves of this problem."

 CTH_fortify_the_west:0 "Fortify the Zumidian Border"
 CTH_fortify_the_west_desc:0 "The greedy Hippogriffs are still occupying our brethren in Zumidia and tensions along the border are high. State of the art fortifications in the border provinces will serve as anchor points for our defence and bases for our inevitable assault. Aztarte, the war goddess, will not allow another inch of zebra land be conquered."

 CTH_expand_the_coastal_forts:0 "Zam's Redoubts"
 CTH_expand_the_coastal_forts_desc:0 "Our ports are the heart of our prosperity and the rivers the veins that spread our wealth to the rest of the people. Zam is the god who oversees this great system of life, and he does so justly. However, Dargon, Lord Under the Sea, known as The Dark One, envies Zam's wealth, striking the surface from his dark domain. Just like wise Zam, we must defend our heart from attacks out of the depths of the sea."

 CTH_fortify_the_capital:0 "Bastion Tanit"
 CTH_fortify_the_capital_desc:0 "Colthage is our home, our mother. Without her, we would be nothing. It is Tanit, the stalwart wife of Za'al, who wept when Colthage was sullied by the Storm King. Upon Tanit, Zalathel Zarca has taken a precious oath, swearing that never again our homes will be in peril. We will build a bastion that will become our sacred guardian, a true successor to our famed city walls. And Tanit will weep no more."

 CTH_appoint_zakbar:0 "Co-Sufrit Baltazar Zakbar"
 CTH_appoint_zakbar_desc:0 "Zalathel is not fond of Baltazar, who is a boring zebra, seemingly without much ambition. The old stallion's greatest joy is balancing budgets and his favourite past time chairing board room meetings. However, Zamilcar put great faith in him back in the day, and the commercial faction of the Scientific Clique loves him. And, at least he can do all the paper work."

 CTH_appoint_zaryes:0 "Co-Sufrit Batrun Zaryes"
 CTH_appoint_zaryes_desc:0 "A zebra of true Colthaginian passions, Batrun Zaryes is Zarca's favoured pick for Co-Sufrit. As a general, Zaryes openly disfavours the Zarcid faction, and he has the ear of the ever-important scientific-clique, representing its militarist wing. Appointing Batrun as Co-Sufrit will not only help prepare the populace for conflict, it should also placate the clique for the time being."

 CTH_appoint_zorrzel:0 "Co-Sufrit Zaron Zorrel"
 CTH_appoint_zorrzel_desc:0 "#TODO quite mild-mannered and not very ambitious, the perfect political puppet, zorrel will do anything the zarcids want. however, he will have no policies of his own."

 CTH_draw_up_a_new_constitution:0 "The Zarcid Constitution"
 CTH_draw_up_a_new_constitution_desc:0 "With all the political offices filled, it is time to fully return to political normalcy. For our state to modernise, it will need a solid bedrock to build upon, it needs a new constitution. This constitution will enshrine the powers of the First Sufrit to protect the people of Colthage and some formal recognition of the rights of most free zebra, and thus should wear down popular support for the radicals."

# Economic
 CTH_invite_wingbardian_investors:0 "The Eler Sea Agreement"
 CTH_invite_wingbardian_investors_desc:0 "Though it is north of us, the "Jewel of the South" is well-known for its industrial might. Some in our government have proposed the idea of offering a dedicated investment zone in our capital for the Wingbardians. This will bolster our economic throughput, provided that they accept the proposition."

 CTH_replant_the_cash_crops:0 "Cotton Plantations"
 CTH_replant_the_cash_crops_desc:0 "Cotton! One of the more useful materials for clothing, and in ever-growing demand across the sea! We already have suitable land to grow cotton in; if we incentivise the growing of cash crops instead of staple foods, we will increase our export value and please the landowners."

 CTH_colthage_zur_industrial_zone:0 "Colthage-Zur Special Economic Zone"
 CTH_colthage_zur_industrial_zone_desc:0 "Colthage and Zur are the two regions the investors from Wingbardy are most interested in. The griffons see potential in developing the ports and industrial centres in the country’s centre. By laxing investment laws and shaking the right claws, we can bring in the capital needed to build up our most promising cities."
 
 CTH_agwp_colthage:0 "AGWP Colthage"
 CTH_agwp_colthage_desc:0 "Our oil deposits in Sophoovene are quite plentiful, but we have had trouble extracting the black gold from some of the jungles in the region. Fortunately, one of the companies interested in expanding their operations is Wingbardy's own Azienda Generale Wingbardia Petroli, one of the finest experts on oil in the world."
 
 CTH_czsez_council:0 "CZSEZ Development Council"
 CTH_czsez_council_desc:0 "Though our industry in the CZSEZ has flourished, investors are being held back by intransigent locals. Our foreign friends have proposed a Development Council to oversee the growth of business in these cities. The idea of letting businessgriffons into the administration does not sit well with the citizens of Colthage and Zur, but they will not complain for long after they see the prosperity these foreigners bring."

 CTH_concentration_principle:0 "Mass Industrial Concentration"
 CTH_concentration_principle_desc:0 "We've made reasonable strides in industrialising some of our coastline, but [Root.GetLeader] believes that we can do more. By focussing all our efforts on our Special Economic Zones, we can turn Zur and Colthage into metropoles worthy of the legacy of our entrepreneurial people. The market of Colthage will yet be the envy of Zebrica!"
 
 CTH_export_priority:0 "Reclaim our Mercantile Legacy"
 CTH_export_priority_desc:0 "With all of the effort that we have put into our main port cities, we are set to become the greatest trade hub in northern Zebrica. We are now set to follow the path of our ancestors and again sail the seas to Griffonia, to sell our wares in the markets of Midoria, Karthin and beyond and to bring back the coin of our beloved customers."
 
 CTH_feathara_university:0 "Feathara University - Colthage Branch"
 CTH_feathara_university_desc:0 "Being one of the most prestigious centres of learning in Wingbardy, the University of Feathara would be an excellent school to model our higher education facilities after. As it so happens, they have expressed interest in establishing a sister school here in Colthage! We had already set aside a plot of land area for a school, so this should work out quite nicely."
 
 CTH_phase_out_slavery:0 "Phase Out Slavery"
 CTH_phase_out_slavery_desc:0 "Early into the Eler Sea Agreement, several investors and traders expressed concern in our continued use of slaves. This concern has grown over the past several months into veiled threats to abandon the CZSEZ unless we do something about it. In the interest of not having the metaphorical rug pulled out from under our thriving economy, we will begin preparations to transition away from slavery."
 
 CTH_fruits_of_partnership:0 "The Fruits of Partnership"
 CTH_fruits_of_partnership_desc:0 "Investors bring capital, which is invested into production capacity. All these factories need zebras to work in them, not only labourers but all sorts of skilled engineers and technicians. The griffons have brought not only wealth, but also the knowledge needed to advance our economy. We have planted the tree of prosperity, and now she finally bears the sweet fruit of our labour."
 
 CTH_reward_minor_warlords:0 "Reward Minor Warlords"
 CTH_reward_minor_warlords_desc:0 "Central authority has been shaky ever since the defeat of the Storm King, and many soldiers are loyal to their military leaders over the government in Colthage. Connecting the country requires more than physical infrastructure, it also requires these key figures to support our cause. Foreign luxuries, fancy titles and gold will buy Colthage the stability it needs for its recovery."

 CTH_colthaginian_autarky:0 "Pursue National Autarky"
 CTH_colthaginian_autarky_desc:0 "Beyond our borders lay ruin and chaos. Many hawkish foreigners’ prey on our factories, our land and our resources. We cannot trust the recovery of the Colthaginian economy to anyone but ourselves. Self-sufficiency is the key to our survival in this hostile world. We have no need for anything that Aztarte does not provide for us, anyhow."

 CTH_expand_the_oil_fields:0 "Expand the Oil Fields"
 CTH_expand_the_oil_fields_desc:0 "A modern ship sails on oil. With black gold, zebra can fly like the griffon or the pegasus. Not only is a domestic oil supply absolutely necessary for our national defence, it is also a boon to the economy. By Zothar the Skilful, we must extract every drop off the stuff we can get our hooves on."

 CTH_finish_the_centeral_railway:0 "Finish the Central Railway"
 CTH_finish_the_centeral_railway_desc:0 "Before the Storm King’s attack ruined the country, we were well on our way to connecting the country via rail. Now that we can shift our attention to the economy once more, the central railway can finally be completed. This will show all Colthaginians that we can recover from even the most damaging blows."

 CTH_university_of_colthage:0 "Refurbish the University of Colthage"
 CTH_university_of_colthage_desc:0 "The University of Colthage is a proud educational institution with a legendary past, but most of all, it is a collection of dusty archives and decrepit lecture halls. The government must put aside funds for its renovation and expansion, if we wish to train and employ the talent needed to research the technology of tomorrow."

 CTH_continue_factory_expansion:0 "Import-Substitution Industrialisation"
 CTH_continue_factory_expansion_desc:0 "It seems a lot of critical products are still being produced abroad. Ammunition for our rifles comes from abroad, as do our toasters. We cannot keep leaning on foreign production to replace what we do not have. Let us build our own ammunition plant and open our own toaster factory! This is the road to autarky, and to prosperity."

 CTH_seize_forign_mines:0 "Seize Foreign Mining Companies"
 CTH_seize_forign_mines_desc:0 "Under the guise of helping our economy recover, foreign companies have extracted our goods from our mines, giving nothing back to the Colthaginian economy. This ends today. Colthage’s mineral wealth shall be used for its own benefit from now on. If the griffons want steel and aluminium they can go work in their own mines!"

 CTH_reconstruct_the_arms_factories:0 "Rebuild the Arms Industry"
 CTH_reconstruct_the_arms_factories_desc:0 "To say the Storm King did not appreciate the long-term planning involved with building a sustainable domestic arms production would be an understatement. Most of the machinery used in our weapon plants was looted and repurposed into parts for weaponry itself, setting the industry back by half a century. To us, then, falls the task to repair fifty years of setback in a matter of months."

 CTH_clear_the_urban_slums:0 "Clear Out Urban Slums"
 CTH_clear_the_urban_slums_desc:0 "Careful urban planning gave way to urban cramming as times got tough and skilled administrators were hard to come by. The slums in our largest cities are unproductive sinks of money and zebras. It is time to bulldoze these makeshift neighbourhoods to make way for proper housing and proper citizens."

 CTH_allocate_land_for_factory_expansion:0 "Subsidise Industrial Expansion"
 CTH_allocate_land_for_factory_expansion_desc:0 "Instead of focussing on the least profitable areas of our cities, we should look to increase our industrial output further. The industrial sector in some cities still has room to grow, and with some careful investments, we could easily increase our economic output. Spend money to make money!"

 CTH_force_farmers_into_the_factories:0 "Planned Urbanisation"
 CTH_force_farmers_into_the_factories_desc:0 "The cities of Colthage, Zur and Hippone were once considered marvels of engineering, full of proud citizens. Our cities can once more be the envy of the world, but for that they need planning. Streets, public transportation, parks, businesses and factories must all be built correctly, in the right amounts, to service the whole of a modern city. After all, a planned city is a modern city."

 CTH_reform_slavery_laws:0 "Reform the Slavery Laws"
 CTH_reform_slavery_laws_desc:0 "The Slavery question has long been up to debate among the Scientifids. Many have argued that it is holding our economy back, but slavery remains a traditional staple of Colthaginian society, especially for the landowners. However, with the onset of modernity, the time for emancipation is ripe, although for the sake of stability, the newly freed must remain at their workplace for a while longer as servants."

 CTH_industrial_rebirth:0 "Industrial Rebirth"
 CTH_industrial_rebirth_desc:0 "With our country connected, our science restored and stability secured, it is time to focus on modernising our economy. One final effort is needed to modernise our production methods and bureaucracy, and then Colthage can consider itself an equal amongst the modern nations."

 CTH_uranium_mining:0 "Uranium Mining Sites"
 CTH_uranium_mining_desc:0 "Who could have known this unassuming ore holds such power? An energy source a hundred times more efficient than coal. An ore more valuable than even gold. And perhaps a weapon more terrifying than a thousand battleships. Once we unlock its secrets, we will become masters of our destiny. And nothing will be the same again."

 CTH_army_of_merceneries_desc:0 "Colthage's military has always relied heavily on mercenaries, albeit during Zamilcar Zarca's reign a professional army was slowly being built. This army was unable to survive the Storm King's invasion and was scattered to the winds. All that remains is the elite Sacred Band of Colthage which faithfully followed Zalathel to victory. After the Storm King's death, the Colthaginian army was quickly rebuilt by relying once again on mercenaries, recruited both from home and abroad. These soldiers, however, are nowhere near as reliable as properly trained warriors."

After Storm King's death, the celebrations quickly turned sour as it became clear Colthage had been too weak to protect Coltva. The rich and powerful Colthaginian landowners justified their rule by claiming to be their defenders, yet they had failed in this duty. So what right did they have to keep the common zebra in chains?\n\nOne rebel leader, Zeshmunazash Zeirutid, managed to rally the Coltvans to his cause and is continuing his war of resistance against the Colthaginian government. §RIf we do not deal with the unrest in the region, this could spill over to be a full-blown rebellion.§!"

 colthage_sicameon_murder.1.d:0 "Professor Balazar Zatid of the University of Colthage was found dead yesterday morning at an archaeological dig site in the ancient Colthaginian colony of New Colthage located on the southern coast of the Scarlet. The professor was well renowned among the Colthaginian academic and archaeological communities and was a forerunner in the study of early Colthaginian civilisation. He had travelled to the island of Scarlet to continue his work of excavating the remains of the town. Early reports say that he was found having been beaten, strangled, shot, and stabbed with his own pickaxe. Local authorities have yet to bring forth any suspects, but there is no doubt that this will spill over into a major diplomatic incident between our two nations.\n\nColthage's ancient history in Griffonia has always been controversial to many griffons, who reject the idea of any substantial Zebrican civilization on their continent, or even deny any meaningful interactions between our two worlds in the past. This flies in the face of contemporary evidence that Professor Balazar Zatid and many others in both Colthage and Griffonia have uncovered, along with historical accounts and events, such as the famed Karthinian General Gripio Zebracanus who conquered the island of Scarlet for the Karthinian Republic over 1500 years ago.\n\nSuch a crime has shocked the local community and the hunt for the perpetrators is still ongoing."

 colthage_sicameon_murder.2.d:0 "Professor Balazar Zatid of the University of Colthage was found dead yesterday morning at an archaeological dig site in the ancient Colthaginian colony of New Colthage, in modern-day Sicameon. The professor was well renowned among the Colthaginian academic and archaeological communities and was a forerunner in the study of early Colthaginian civilisation. He had travelled to the island of Scarlet in Sicameon to continue his work of excavating the remains of the town. Early reports say that he was found having been beaten, strangled, shot, and stabbed with his own pickaxe. Local authorities have yet to bring forth any suspects, but the Sicameonese authorities assured us that they are treating the matter with utmost urgency.\n\nColthage's ancient history in Griffonia has always been controversial to many griffons, who reject the idea of any substantial Zebrican civilization on their continent, or even deny any meaningful interactions between our two worlds in the past. This flies in the face of contemporary evidence that Professor Balazar Zatid and many others in both Colthage and Griffonia have uncovered, along with historical accounts and events, such as the famed Karthinian General Gripio Zebracanus who conquered the island of Scarlet for the Karthinian Republic over 1500 years ago.\n\nThe professor's death has sparked outcry and mourning across Colthage. Protests have already started in the universities and there are many in the Senate and governing council who are calling for a firm response to such a crime."

 colthage_sicameon_murder.3.d:0 "As expected, the Colthaginian ambassador in Midoria has openly and officially asked for an apology from our country in regards to the murder of Professor Zatid. Our ambassador notes that newspapers in the Zebrican nation have been printing inflammatory editorials, accusing the Scarlet islanders and griffons in general of denying their history and of racial supremacy. Naturally our government doesn't support such notions, but the Colthaginian government has taken the opportunity to look tough towards their own people with both claws. Or both hooves, to be more apt.\n\nEither way, the ball is now in our park. There is no easy solution here, as our investigators have not found any evidence or even any suspects and delaying a response to the ambassador would only escalate tensions further. We could give an apology for something we had no claw in and lose face towards our own people, but put the case to rest, or take a stand against Colthage's demands and risk putting fuel on the fire of protests overseas, perhaps forcing Colthage to take more drastic actions."

The Sicameonese government proposed a government allowance for the victim's family and a plaque to be placed at the crime scene commemorating the professor's contributions to understanding of our shared histories.\n\nIt seems this generous gesture has calmed tensions across the country, and the press has already started speculating about closer trade ties and a new appreciation of the shared history between grifons and zebra."

(Could include conspiracy theory that because Balazar critisized Zarca government, he was assassinated, so people blame Zarca for his death) In major cities, the protesters have attacked government buildings and are demanding political reform and for an end of the Zarca administration. However, local police have been able to quell unrest in most places, but the underlying issue is still there.\n\nThe Zarca government can use this as an excuse to hunt down dissenters and lock them away before they cause any more issues."

 CTH_internal_factions_desc:0 "The Sufrits cannot rule alone. Behind every leader there are powerful political groups keeping them in power. The §YZarcids§! that ruled over Colthage for decades cemented power with the aid of the §OScientifids§! and the §RMilitary§!. During this time the §GLandowners§! grew rich and powerful, and now extend strong control over their huge tracts of land.\n\nRecently two new organisations have been rising in popularity. §gConstitutionalists§! wish for a return to democratic government and an end to the Zarcas. The §CHarmonites§! go a step further, seeking to bring radical changes to the nation and rebuilding along harmonistic lines.\n\n§YLoyal factions will provide bonuses to the nation and disloyal factions will grind the nation to a halt. These bonuses or penalties increase with their power. However, powerful factions may make demands of the Sufrit, push their own agendas, or even plot against the Sufrit if they are disloyal.§!"
