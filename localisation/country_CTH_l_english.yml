 ### LEADER DESCRIPTIONS ###
 POLITICS_ZALATHEL_ZARCA_DESC:0 "As the son of Zamilcar Zarca, former-head of the powerful Zarca family and longest serving Consul of Colthage, Zalathel grew up in Colthaginian high-society during a period of peace and prosperity. However, all that changed when the Storm King attacked.\n\nDespite joining his father in the defence of the city, the Storm King's forces overwhelmed the defenders and Zalathel was forced to abandon Colthage with his two brothers. The zebra fled high into the Alaudid Range to lead a guerilla force to harass the Storm King's army as it continued to rampage in Northern Zebrica. When news of the Storm King's death reached him, Zalathel led the attack on Colthage itself and executed its collaborationist governors. With the city secure, he was seen as a liberator by many, but did not hesitate to crackdown on any opposition to his faction. He turned to the warlords that had risen up throughout Colthage and those who would not step into line where quickly taken out.\n\nNow the new Sufrit, he has enough strength and support to keep power, but his position is a precarious one. Only time will tell if he will continue the legacy of his father, the position he was groomed for."
 POLITICS_ZANNO_MZELQATID_DESC:0 "Zanno Mzelqatid is a son of a landowning well-off family in Western Colthage. He attended university in Wingbardy thanks to a government exchange program and there he became part of the ever growing urban middle class that read republican Griffon literature and spoke out against the Zarcid regimen as an affront to Colthage's Republican traditions.\n\nIn 1006 as the war of independence was dying down, Zanno travelled around the nation gathering support from the recently freed Zebra to campaign for an end of Zarcid tyranny and promised them true political and economic reform. All that had to be done was for them to make their voices heard to the senate. Unfortunately this led to Zanno being arrested a week before the senate voted Zarathal Zarca in as Sufrit. Zanno was eventually released from prison on bail, but managed to make his way across the border into the Hippogriff-run Zebrican Mandate where he declared the election as illegitimate and began gathering supporters.\n\nPersonally, he is often seen as aloof and often not in touch with reality. In Wingbardy he ended up becoming a fan of Spiritism and believes he is a medium who can talk to the dead and magical spirits. He believes the spirit of his dead brother visited him and told him to dedicate his life to helping others, and to never drink alcohol or smoke. He is also a strong believer in homeopathy over magical or clinical medicines. Regardless, he is well liked by people he meets and is held in high regard by the employees of his plantations. He introduced sweeping education, medical, and social reforms for the plantation and the nearby towns, building schools and hospitals (staffed by actual doctors thankfully). He is against slavery and the semi-official class system in the nation and wishes to see a true liberal democratic Colthage."
 CTH_baltazar_zakbar_desc:0 "While the Scientific Clique has no formal leadership, Baltazar Zakbar is widely acknowledged as the political figurehead of the faction. He supported the Zarcids from the very beginning, primarily because of Zamilcar's efforts to modernize the country which aligned with the goals of the Scientifids.\n\nHaving studied law and economics extensively and even worked as a teacher at the University of Colthage, Zakbar is an economic mastermind who was credited with laying the foundations for Colthage's economic miracle in the 900s. It was he who balanced the budget, established a gold standard for the zhekel and signed lucrative commercial treaties with Wingbardy and Sicameon. Without his genius, Colthage would've remained as backwards as many other zebra countries. However, his reforms came at the expense of the common folk, who lost much of their land and wealth to mighty magnates.\n\nZakbar's influence was so great that Zamilcar grew worried. Shortly before the Storm King's invasion, he sent the economist to Griffonia to negotiate a loan. This move likely saved Zakbar's life, as he was on another continent when flames of chaos engulfed Colthage.\n\nAfter returning to his home, Zakbar was quick to assert dominance once again. His relations with the Zarcids had soured, especially because he saw Zalathel as nothing more than a selfish, hot-headed youth. The only thing that kept him from trying to take over the country was General Batrun Zaryes, who deeply distrusted Colthaginian intellectuals. It was clear to him that more preparations needed to be made before the Scientifids could assert dominance and guarantee order and progress in Colthage."

 ### FOCUS ###
 CTH_zarcid_legacy:0 "Lean on the Zarcid Legacy"
 CTH_zarcid_legacy_desc:0 "The Zarca family is more than just a powerful political family. To many Colthaginians, the Zarcids are exemplars of the power and glory of the country's history. By invoking the family name, we will be able to appoint some loyalists to important bureaucratic positions, which should allow us some political momentum to deal with the hampered economy and the unrest in the provinces."

 CTH_bread_or_stick_politics:0 "Bread or Stick Politics"
 CTH_bread_or_stick_politics_desc:0 "Zamilcar Zarca's bread or stick politics was an informal system of patronage. Less influential chiefs, landowners and other community leaders would get bread or other help for their people in return for backing Zamilcar whenever he needed them while those who refused would be forced out of politics. The Storm King broke a lot of these informal bonds, and it will take time to reforge them."

 CTH_reintroduce_poltical_chiefs:0 "Reintroduce Political Chiefs"
 CTH_reintroduce_poltical_chiefs_desc:0 "The regional divides of Colthaginian society are not a new phenomenon. Zamilcar Zarca dealt with this problem by assigning political chiefs, a local office used to undermine dissidents, which proved effective in the hinterlands. When we lost political control after the Storm King's invasion, the system collapsed, but we can bring the chiefs back from retirement to reassert control over the countryside."
 
 CTH_reinforce_the_western_garrisons:0 "Reshuffle the Western Garrisons"
 CTH_reinforce_the_western_garrisons_desc:0 "Guarding the border with Hippogriff occupied Zumidia has been regarded as an easy assignment for years. The zebra in the area are usually loyal, unlike the meddlesome Coltvans. However, rumours of Zanno's return have fired up the local youth and the lazy garrison is doing nothing to stop their rallies. Replacing the garrison with veterans from Coltva will teach these foals the strength of Colthage."

 CTH_crackdown_on_the_western_bandits:0 "Crackdown on Western Bandits"
 CTH_crackdown_on_the_western_bandits_desc:0 "The lazy western garrisons have let bandits fester in the west, making us look weak and aiding the Maharzaalid movement. With real soldiers now stationed in the area, we can begin to root out the criminals and restore order to the land. Our new political chiefs will investigate bandit strongholds, so we can decisively rid ourselves of this problem."

 CTH_fortify_the_west:0 "Fortify the Zumidian Border"
 CTH_fortify_the_west_desc:0 "The greedy Hippogriffs are still occupying our brethren in Zumidia and tensions along the border are high. State of the art fortifications in the border provinces will serve as anchor points for our defence and bases for our inevitable assault. Aztarte, the war goddess, will not allow another inch of zebra land be conquered."

 CTH_expand_the_coastal_forts:0 "Zam's Redoubts"
 CTH_expand_the_coastal_forts_desc:0 "Our ports are the heart of our prosperity and the rivers the veins that spread our wealth to the rest of the people. Zam is the god who oversees this great system of life, and he does so justly. However, Dargon, Lord Under the Sea, known as The Dark One, envies Zam's wealth, striking the surface from his dark domain. Just like wise Zam, we must defend our heart from attacks out of the depths of the sea."

 CTH_fortify_the_capital:0 "Bastion Zanit"
 CTH_fortify_the_capital_desc:0 "Colthage is our home, our mother. Without her, we would be nothing. It is Zanit, the stalwart wife of Za'al, who wept when Colthage was sullied by the Storm King. Upon Zanit, Zalathel Zarca has taken a precious oath, swearing that never again our homes will be in peril. We will build a bastion that will become our sacred guardian, a true successor to our famed city walls. And Zanit will weep no more."

 CTH_appoint_zakbar:0 "Co-Sufrit Baltazar Zakbar"
 CTH_appoint_zakbar_desc:0 "Zalathel is not fond of Baltazar, who is a boring zebra, seemingly without much ambition. The old stallion's greatest joy is balancing budgets and his favourite pastime is chairing board room meetings. However, Zamilcar put great faith in him back in the day, and the commercial faction of the Scientific Clique loves him. And best of all, he can do all the paperwork."

 CTH_anti_corruption_initiative:0 "Anti-Corruption Initiative"
 CTH_anti_corruption_initiative_desc:0 "As we attempt to restore order in the countryside, matters are not helped at all by the stench of corruption that every citizen can smell wafting off of the government. Far too many officials neglect their duties, instead using their positions to steal from the public and enrich themselves. It is clear that good, honest administration will be needed in order to get things back on track."

 CTH_scientific_management:0 "Scientific Management"
 CTH_scientific_management_desc:0 "Although decades have passed since the Industrial Revolution was first brought to Colthage, when it comes to production our way of thinking remains stuck in the old craft production mindset. Rather than staying slaves to established traditions, empirical methods should be used to determine new, efficient procedures that maximise labour productivity."

 CTH_mechanized_agriculture:0 "Mechanise Agriculture"
 CTH_mechanized_agriculture_desc:0 "With the advent of industrialisation and the development of complex machines, farming methods have taken a truly massive leap forward. This modern equipment will be costly to acquire, but since mechanisation would allow our farmers to get more work done per day than has ever been possible before, the expense is well worth it."

 CTH_technological_exchange:0 "Propose Technological Exchange To Wingbardy"
 CTH_technological_exchange_desc:0 "Non-governmental technological exchanges between Colthage and Wingbardy have taken place since the late 970s, and the resulting transfer of technical knowledge has been greatly beneficial. An official technological exchange programme would be a fantastic opportunity for our technicians to gain knowledge about the development of science and technology in the world."
 
 CTH_secular_education:0 "Secular Education"
 CTH_secular_education_desc:0 "In our country, education has moved from being the preserve of parents and informal communities to being the concern of trained specialists funded by public taxes. Therefore, public schools should be kept separated from any specific religious institution. Instruction in religion is the domain of parents and their religions, not the business of the state education system."

 CTH_appoint_zaryes:0 "Co-Sufrit Batrun Zaryes"
 CTH_appoint_zaryes_desc:0 "A zebra of true Colthaginian passions, Batrun Zaryes is Zarca's favoured pick for Co-Sufrit. As a general, Zaryes openly disfavours the scientific clique, but has widespread popular support both among civilians and soldiers. Appointing Batrun as Co-Sufrit will not only help prepare the populace for conflict, it should also placate the military for the time being."

 CTH_draw_up_a_new_constitution_desc:0 "With all the political offices filled, it is time to fully return to political normalcy. For our state to modernise, it will need a solid bedrock to build upon, it needs a new constitution. This constitution will enshrine the powers of the First Sufrit to protect the people of Colthage and some formal recognition of the rights of most free zebra, and thus should wear down popular support for the radicals."

 colthage_coltvan.1.t:0 "The New Commander of The East"
 colthage_coltvan.1.d_annizalid:0 ""Father, did you have to deal with generals as problematic as these?" Zalathel Zarca, Sufrit of Colthage and heir to the Zarca Family's power, sighed as he looked up to the portrait of his father. The only answer he received was Zamilcar's proud gaze staring down from his office's wall. Taking power had been easy, but one particular problem of the Zarca inheritance was frustrating Zalathel: Coltva.\n\nJust like himself, the Coltvans had fought a war of attrition against the Storm King, but now they resisted Colthaginian control as well. Under the guise of land reform, rebel leader Zeshmunazash Zeirutid rallied the forces of Coltvan independence. The situation was dire. Although the Colthaginian forces outgunned the rebels for now, they lacked a clear strategy. To crush the rebels, Zalathel needed to appoint one of his generals to lead the way, as he himself was indispensable in Colthage.\n\nThree candidates had come forward, although sadly both of his brothers had passed up the job. First to apply was Bezelshazzar Zerutra, ever looking to increase his own influence. It was no secret that the zebra was an addict, but he could lead a fight. If given enough incentive, Zerutra would pacify Coltva, but Zalathel worried about increasing the sly general's power.\n\nThe second applicant was Jebzel Zoblos, whose distaste for the Coltvan people was well known. This zebra would do whatever was within his power to crush the rebels. But Zoblos had a one-track mind, and Zalathel feared that the general might pass up opportunities to undermine the rebellion in different ways than brute force. The final candidate was Ziliad Annizalid, a general who sympathised with the constitutionalist faction. By all accounts Ziliad was a decent zebra, and his mild manners might help legitimise Colthaginian rule and make Zeirutid seem as the ruthless party. However, Zalathel feared the general might try to advance his own faction in Coltva, replacing one problem for another. After wheighing the candidates for a while longer, the Sufrit decided to name as Commander of the East... "

 colthage_coltvan.2.t:0 "Zerutra Imposes Martial Law In Coltva"
 colthage_coltvan.2.d:0 "Couriers and criers spread the news through the towns of Coltva: General Zerutra had arrived with a fresh contingent of troops and a mandate from the Sufrit to restore order. His first order of business was to impose martial law. Several of the protections of the Colthaginian Constitution would be suspended in Coltva and more powers granted to the military over local police and military. Aiding the rebels in any way, such as providing directions, lodgings or supplies, would be criminal and was subject to trial by military tribunal.\n\nThe news had a chilling effect on the Coltvans, with many of the zebra on the fence about the Zeirutids deciding to withdraw support. Another proclamation the general had spread was even more surprising to the Coltvans. Zerutra intended to make his new headquarters in the Castillo quarter of Kizil-Zeb, the historical centre of the town. This was a bold move and many zebras considered this a direct challenge to Zeshmunasash. Abandon his influence in the city and suffer a propaganda defeat, or fight, with Colthage still having the upper hoof in soldiers and materiel and risk losing it all.\n\nFor now, Kizil-Zeb's usual garrison was still in place, a light enough detachment to allow the Zeirutids free roam of the city, as Zerutra secured other strategic locations first, intend on giving the rebels time to respond to his challenge. The Colthaginians played their first move, and Coltva held its breath to see if Zeirutid would let himself be caught off-guard."
 colthage_coltvan.2.a:0 "General Zerutra, you are a bold one."
 
 colthage_coltvan.3.t:0 "The Kizil-Zeb Gambit"
 colthage_coltvan.3.d:0 "Commander of the East Bezelshazzar Zerutra looked out over the city of Kizil-Zeb from his headquarters, positioned on a hill outside the city. His troops had split up into multiple columns, preparing to move into the city from different angles. The start of the operation would not be much trouble, with the modern outskirts of the city consisting of broad straight lanes with clear avenues of attack. The real problem would be the Castillo quarter, the hilltop which once housed a fort from which the ancient Colthaginian trading post of Kizil-Zeb grew. The streets were windy and narrow, with the buildings crammed against each other in a tight maze.\n\nBut general Zerutra knew that it was not the layout of the city which made this operation so peculiar. As he peered through his binoculars, he spied for any sign of enemy movement in the city below, but he could not pierce through the tight inner-city alleys. The real difficulty of this operation was his lack of knowledge of the enemy's intention. If they had left the city open, then the challenge would be to ascertain that without having to ransack every building in the city. If not, Zerutra would only find out when his troops would be stuck in close quarters fighting, denying him the use of his artillery. Of course, Zerutra had full confidence in his professional soldiers in a pinched battle.\n\nThe general smirked, as he had the rebels right where he wanted them. Either they trapped themselves in a siege, or they fled, showing they were nothing more than frightened peasants. Satisfied with himself, he retreated into his tent, closing the flap and taking out his favourite spirit-expanding substance. He grimaced as his eyes lit up in anticipation." 
 colthage_coltvan.3.a:0 "Time to spice up the thrill of victory!"
 
 colthage_coltvan.4.t:0 "Zerutra's Triumph"
 colthage_coltvan.4.d:0 "A few hours after he retreated into his tent, his adjutant pulled a dazed general Zerutra out of his tent and into his open roofed car. As the vehicle drove into Kizil-Zeb, his aide tried to explain the events of the day to his superior. The rebels had fled, and except for a few close calls with nervous soldiers and scared civilians, the city had been taken without incident. Although Bezelshazzar's eyes barely showed a hint of acknowledgement, his mouth curled into a sheepish smirk. What followed was a hastily arranged parade through the Castillo quarter, with the citizens of the city watching their ‘conqueror' transition from an almost catatonic state to pretending to be a God in his motorcade, slowly back to normal at the end of the day. Zerutra's troops, already well aware of their general's inclinations, tried to ignore the embarrassment as best they could.\n\nHowever, little changed. Zerutra's troops now had the unenviable task of keeping a tight watch over his new headquarters, with the city still being an refuge for rebels, while Zeirutid had his hooves free, able to strike wherever he wished from his hideouts in the mountains. Furthermore, any propaganda effect the Colthaginians had hoped to gain from the capture of the city was nullified by Zerutra's absurd behaviour during the parade. Word of the debacle had even reached back to Colthage itself, with the Sufrit writing an angry letter to his general, demanding some sort of success, although The Commander of the East did not seem fazed by Zarca's threats.\n\nThe general would leave the occupation to his aides, while he locked himself in his office, devising new plans to break the Cotlvan resistance. And behind closed doors, he often chose to forget about it all..."
 colthage_coltvan.4.a:0 "Colthage can't afford many more victories like this one."

 colthage_coltvan.5.t:0 "A Cache of Booze"
 colthage_coltvan.5.d:0 " The Commander of the East, general Zerutra, sat on a chair on the balcony of his headquarters in Kizil-Zeb, looking at the bunch of papers he had received a day ago, and then out over the city, and then back over the papers again. He sighed and took a sip of water. No alcohol, no drugs, not even a pipe. Not on the day that everything hung in the balance. In front of him lay terms given to Zerutra by Zeshmunasash Zeirutid. The rebel leader had them smuggled into the compound with a booze delivery, his signed letter politely hoping that peace could give more pleasure than even the stiff drinks. On a personal note, Zeirutid thanked the Colthaginian for taking over Kizil-Zeb without bloodshed, and mentioned how Colthaginian soldiers often acted more justly than the police officers they were assisting.\n\nThe terms themselves, Zerutra had to admit, were reasonable. Though worded with the skills of a seasoned negotiator, the terms were plain and without the ambiguous language which treaties were usually known for. However cunning his adversary was, he was not underhoofed. Colthage would retain sovereignty over Coltva, but the locals would be allowed a great deal of autonomy. The general had never been much of a farmer, but the papers spoke in passionate words about a land reform plan Zeirutid wished to implement, which would allow all Coltvans to take care of themselves.\n\nSo now the unenviable decision was up to Zerutra. Would he accept these terms, and defend his compromise with the rebels he was sent to root out to the Senate and the Sufrit? Or would he keep fighting these tenacious farmers? If he chose the latter, Zeirutid's letter plainly recommended him to save the alcohol for the Colthaginian wounded."
 colthage_coltvan.5.a:0 "I will accept the terms, a toast to peace!"
 colthage_coltvan.5.b:0 "I will not risk my career for these farmers, Colthage will have order."

 colthage_coltvan.6.t:0 "The Price of Peace"
 colthage_coltvan.6.d:0 "The august halls of the Colthaginian Senate were busier than usual, as the scandal of the Commander of the East reached its conclusion. On the speaker's stand stood general Zerutra, surrounded by  stone benches full of ill-humoured senators. Zerutra recognised several senior officers amongst them, and when they noticed him looking, he was met by angry gazes. The murmuring died down as the eldest senator, president of the Senate by ancient precedent, tapped his staff on the ground and motioned for Zerutra to speak.\n\n"Honoured senators, Colthaginians, I come bearing the gift of peace, yet my name is used in these halls as if I were her killer." Accusations of treason and addiction already started flying towards the general from the officers and their militarist supporters. In the following hour, Zerutra spoke to a tumultuous senate about land reform and regionalism, becoming an unwilling advocate for the Coltvan cause. Afterwards, the first motion passed moved for the Sufrit to appoint a new Commander of the East, a sensitive political blow questioning Zalathel Zarca's authority directly.\n\nThe stern-faced Sufrit declined his turn to speak, and after the Senate session was adjourned, met up with Zerutra, flanked by two Sacred Band soldiers. "Good afternoon, general Zerutra. First of all, I regret the Senate's decision today."\n\nThe general frowned, surprised by the Sufrit's seeming mildness. "It is understandable, if anything they would have wanted the final say on the agreement, although I doubt they would have accepted."\n\n"You have to make difficult decisions in the field, Zerutra, and every soldier lost in Coltva would have been missed elsewhere." Now the general was truly baffled, did Zarca become soft? The Sufrit noticed his general's surprise and let out a rare smile "Do not think I agree with Zeirutid's plans. He is still a traitor and will get justice in time. But Colthage cannot be divided, not now. Have a good day, general." Zerutra nodded dutifully, although privately he strongly doubted if Zarca would ever be able to get Zereutid in front of a judge. The general shook his head when he left the Senate himself, taking a sip of some of the drink Zeirutid had sent him weeks earlier."
 colthage_coltvan.6.a:0 "It would have been a shame to put this on a wound."

 colthage_coltvan.7.t:0 "The Word Spreads"
 colthage_coltvan.7.d:0 "The mountain air was blowing through Zeshmunasash Zeirutid's mane as the zebra descended down to a village in one of the many small valleys that dotted the Coltvan hinterland. Under his hoof, the leader of the Coltvan rebellion was holding rolls of pamphlets. His compatriots, descending the steep path after him, did the same. "Careful now, I will take it personally if any of you falls and gets there before me." Zeirutid joked, his eyes focussed downwards, careful with every step. There had been a lot of grumbling when the rebel leader had asked for volunteers for delivering pamphlets, as his fellow rebels all styled themselves dashing heroes instead of delivery colts. The grumbling turned into embarrassment when the rebel leader announced he'd just do it himself, after which volunteers rapidly applied.\n\nThe zebra did not stay on the streets of the village for long and hurried to a larger building where they were quickly led in by an elderly zebra mare who smiled brightly. "Zeshmunasash, in the flesh!" She would say warmly, before inspecting the stacks of papers the Coltvan rebels gratefully put down. "We will have these spread over Coltva and beyond soon enough. I wish they didn't contain such awful news..." The mare would sigh and shake her head.\n\n"Coltvans need to know what is happening. The Commander of the East has crossed the line. Any zebra who was hoping for a peaceful solution cannot look away anymore."\n\nAgain the mare would sigh. "It is simple when you bring it like that, I suppose." The mare would walk over to another room while muttering; "Now, you and your intrepid gunslingers have earned a reward for your daring actions today, what can I give you from my refrigerator?""
 colthage_coltvan.7.a:0 ""Yogurt, if you'd please!""
 
 colthage_coltvan.8.t:0 "On the Brink of War"
 colthage_coltvan.8.d:0 ""I come here with a simple message, my sufrit, the situation is spiralling out of control. Your appointee has only worsened the situation. Perhaps another zebra would have been a better fit."\n\nZalathel Zarca wheezed at the zebra's accusation, impatient with the governor who was twenty years his senior. This stallion, who had been in charge of Coltva until the Commander of the East arrived, was a leftover from his father's inner circle. "Governor, you ask for patience, while I have waited to act for months. You are the one who did not manage to bring back order after the yetis were driven out. I do not care at all for your military advice. Tell me about this situation properly or go back to your duties."\n\nSensing that he had little to gain from questioning the Sufrit's decisions, the governor elaborated on the Coltvans instead. "Zeirutid grows bolder by the day, encouraged by his swelling numbers. Due to, ahem..." The zebra stallion coughed politely, "Recent events, many Coltvans that were ambivalent towards us have drifted to the rebel camp. Your commander has broken what little trust the common Coltvan had left for us. Only the towns with a direct armed presence are still controlled by us and even just supplying our troops is getting expensive, as the soldiers no longer trust local suppliers."\n\nThe governor eyed at the Sufrit expectantly. He had known the reign of Zamilcar Zarca, and expected Zalathel, like his father, to come up with some sort of creative solution. The sufrit, meanwhile, nodded solemnly. "So be it, I shall dispatch new orders to the garrison and mobilise reserve forces." He then turned his attention directly to the governor. "I believe we are resigned to trot the path of war, it is the only way left to save our Republic. Prepare your staff to evacuate from Kizil-Zeb immediately if the worst should occur."\n\nThe governor frowned, "You see no other way, my sufrit?" Zalathel shook his head."
 colthage_coltvan.8.a:0 ""If the Coltvans do not bend, they will have to be broken.""
 
 colthage_coltvan.9.t:0 "Battle of Kizil-Zeb"
 colthage_coltvan.9.d:0 "The buzzing of mosquitoes was annoying general Zerutra. Otherwise, his little cloud was perfect. Truly the gods themselves could not even enjoy such comforts, if it wasn't for that blasted buzzing. With a rip his cloud was engulfed in light, and the buzzing turned into shouting, with the cacophony of battle audible in the distance. Zerutra's adjutant rushed towards him and saluted, the rest of the general's staff waiting at the entrance. "Sir, the rebels, they are fighting back. They say Zereutid is in the city, but we can't get to him. What do we do sir?\n\nGeneral Zerutra took a deep breath, and he seemed to be coming back to his senses. In his head an incredible migraine started stirring, instead of on a cloud he found himself at the edge of a roaring volcano. "We must stop it, before it is too late." The commander stated with a fearful gaze, barely present.\n\nHis adjutant looked befuddled, stammering back. "I just told you, we can't reach him, we can't win like this-"\n\nZerutra cut off his second, "It's all going to erupt, if we don't stop it now. We have to use everything we have. .. "\n\n"Everything sir?" Zerutra was asked by his staffer, to which he nodded determinedly. Half an hour later, the roar of dozens of howitzers silenced the volcano and brought the general back into reality. "Holy mother Aztarte..." He muttered, running towards the sound. "Cease fire, cease fire by the gods!" The general screamed his lungs out and managed to stop the barrage mid-fire. However, the damage was done. Bezelshazzar slumped down defeated as he watched the blaze on the horizon from amidst his cannons. No zebra came to comfort him, nor did the rebels come to capture him, as they were busy fighting the firestorm engulfing the historic city centre.\n\nNews of the Battle of Kizil-Zeb soon spread, even making it to overseas papers, but the artillery barrage only galvanised Coltvan resistance. And at the next Zereutid raid, the Colthaginians heard cries of: "Remember the Castillo!""
 colthage_coltvan.9.a:0 "This was the last time, I swear."
 
 colthage_coltvan.10.t:0 "The Siege of Coltva"
 colthage_coltvan.10.d:0 "General Jezbel Zoblos arrived in Coltva at the head of a large military convoy. Once in the province, the mare had her forces disperse, with sizable groups heading for Kizil-Zeb, Coltartan, and even across the interior to Marelaka. All urban settlements would receive a sizeable influx of soldiers. At first, it seemed like the new Commander of the East merely intended to strengthen the garrison, but nothing could be further from the truth. Arriving in Kizil-Zeb at the head of her forces, Zoblos would be quick to dash any hope of a gentle regime. She commanded her forces to set up camp, and ordered all non Coltvans to leave the city. Within hours, Colthaginian soldiers had set up checkpoints at every access road, and patrols had been set out to make sure no zebra could leave the city. Telecom-cables were cut, making communication to the outside difficult. Even sea-access was denied by a destroyer blocking the port. Meanwhile, the same scene would repeat itself around cities and towns all over Coltva.\n\nAfter the initial shock had worn off, several zebras from both in and outside Kizil-Zeb would attempt to come close to the Colthaginian perimeter, but were sent away, with warning shots if they were insistent. General Zoblos was watching with glee as she saw more and more of the city’s inhabitants eye her perimeter with concern or desperation, as the realisation of what had happened sank in. Eventually, she ordered her soldiers to bring one of the braver Coltvans who had been hanging around one of the roadblocks for a while to her. The young Coltvan, barely a stallion, would look at the Colthaginian general with a contemptuous glare, held down by two of Jezbel’s soldiers. “Let me go, you brutes!” The zebra demanded, struggling against the soldiers in vain while Jezbel smiled amusedly.\n\n“You Coltvans can do nothing but squirm after all...” She leaned closer, grinning widely. “Until you filthy peasants stop resisting the rule of your superiors, you and all the others in those mud huts over there will not be receiving any company, understood?”\nThe Coltvan’s eyes widened and his squirming only grew more intense. “You will not get away with this, you filthy daughter of Zargon! May the Deeplord swallow you and drag Colthage down with it!”\nThe stallion’s curse would just make Commander of the East chuckle. “Take it up with Zeirutid. And tell your leader it is up to him to decide if you will ever see fresh food again.” Jezbel gestured towards her soldiers and they carried the young stallion away."
 colthage_coltvan.10.a:0 "They will break soon."

 colthage_coltvan.11.t:0 "Zeirutid Protests"
 colthage_coltvan.11.d:0 "Sufrit Zalathel Zarca shook his head and reread the letter on his desk, before looking up to the portrait of his father. As always, Zamilcar did not provide any advice, just a stern gaze. Zeshmunasash Zeirutid was the last zebra the Sufrit expected a letter from, not least a letter so polite, with attached photographs and reports from Colthaginian civil servants in Coltva:\n\n“Dear Zalathel,\n\nI write to you in the understanding that we both share the common decency of zebra, by which I mean a basic respect for sentient life, especially when it comes to civilians and foals. That common decency seems to not be universal, however, as your new Commander of the East has demonstrated. By besieging the cities of Coltva (which are Colthaginian cities!) she has forced the civilian population into the conflict, causing much unnecessary suffering and a lack of food. Although I oppose you politically, I believe you understand your duty as Sufrit is to defend Colthaginian citizens. Therefore, I request that you replace Jezbel Zoblos with a zebra who is not willing to endanger civilian lives. In case information about the gravity of the situation has not reached you yet, I have attached photographs and reports by your civil servants about the extent of Zoblos’ crimes.\nI implore you to make the right decision.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nZeshmunasash Zeirutid”\n\nZalathel had no idea how the Coltvan even managed to send him a letter, and he could only guess the zebra’s intentions. Zarca had to admit Zoblos’ methods were excessive, to put it mildly. If Zeirutid was desperate enough to beg for a replacement, however, could that mean the blockades were actually working? If that was the case, perhaps this strategy might save more lives than it would cost, in the long term."
 colthage_coltvan.11.a:0 "Keep Zoblos, her methods seem to be bearing fruit."
 colthage_coltvan.11.b:0 "I will not stand for this. Annizalid will salvage the situation."
 
 colthage_coltvan.12.t:0 "The Breakout"
 colthage_coltvan.12.d:0 "“Our objective tonight is simple, everyzebra.” Zeirutid’s calming voice was carried by short wave radio to attics and hideouts all over Kizil-Zeb, where Coltvan rebels clutched their revolvers and rifles tight while listening to their leader. “We escape the blockade and head for the mountains, where we have freedom of movement. For that we need to break this blockade. Everything depends on speed and coordination. Wait for my signal flare, then strike as one to overwhelm the enemy. We can do this; I will see you on the other side.” With those words, Zeirutid cut off the transmission and loaded his flare gun and swung his rifle over his shoulder. Without a word the zebra headed outside, towards the rally point for his unit.\n\nHalf an hour later, the silence was deafening. Zeirutid’s left his unit on the edge of the city, sneaking forward himself. There he was, prone in the tall grass, as close to the entrenched Colthaginians as he dared. This had to be enough time for all units to assemble. The Coltvan reached for his flare gun and aimed towards the sky. The flare set of a cascade of action. Coltvan battle cries came from behind him and confused shouts from the front. With unflinching focus, the rebel leader grabbed his rifle and took aim at the trenches. The ringing of his shot cut through the air; the scream of his target muffled by the cranking of the bolt. A second shot sowed confusion and fear as zebra dug for cover. More flares lit up the sky and searchlights aimed towards his comrades. Zeirutid’s third shot was already drowned out by fire from all sides. His eyes lost focus as he heard the hoofsteps of his comrades’ race towards the trenches. Leaping to his hooves himself, Zeirutid joined them into the fray. His hooves hit the sand of the trenches. To the left a flash illuminated a frightened young Colthaginian face. With a rushed gallop and the butt of his rifle, she falls down. Safe for now. Breathing heavily, the Coltvan looks around to see only his comrades left standing in the trench, but lights and shouting in the distant indicated Zoblos’ forces would soon come to plug the hole. Zeirutid again grabs his flare gun, the second flare signalling to the Coltvans it was time to scatter."
 colthage_coltvan.12.a:0 "The Rebels have breached the perimeter!"
 
 colthage_coltvan.13.t:0 "Meeting the other Zeirutid"
 colthage_coltvan.13.d:0 "“Finally, Zarishat Zeirutid. We found her lst night in a Kizil-Zeb attic after the breakout, ma’am.” The soldier pointed his hoof over his shoulder towards the cell door. “Although she might not be very cooperative.”\nGeneral Jezbel Zoblos, grinned eagerly. “Oh, she will be forthcoming, I am sure!” The general then opened the cell door and trotted inside. The captured zebra inside looked like a mess. Her mane was ruffled and unkept, her eyes, which had big bags under them, stared at the general groggily. Zoblos sat down in front of Zeirutid. “Good afternoon, prisoner.”\n\nBefore Jezbel could say more, Zarishat interrupted, her voiced drenched in irony. “Zoblos. You have got the wrong sibling, you just missed him. Zesh is out of town.”\nThe taunt managed to wipe the smile of Jezbel’s face. “No, I think you are exactly who I need, Zarishat. Your brother has been quite the thorn in my side, you see.”\n\n“You and me both, general.” No change in tone. Now even the ever-confident Zoblos gave the Zeirutid a confused look. Was this an act? The sister seemed nothing like the brother, yet her sources told her Zarishat was with Zeshmunasash for most of the rebellion. Maybe this was just the entrance she needed. Her grin returned.\n\n“If that is so, why don’t you help me get rid of this thorn? I will get you and any zebra you want out of here in no time. And you can get your home back too, if you want.” Focus appeared in Zarishat’s disinterested eyes, but nevertheless, the offer seemed to not phase her.\n“I’d help if I could. If Zesh had one hideout he’d have been caught already. Listen, he is way smarter than you are. If you care about your career just give up, that’s my advice to you.”\nJezbel started to wheeze and punched her hoof onto the table. “Who do you think you are talking to, you filthy Coltvan? I don’t think you understand. If you, or any of the other prisoners related to the rebels, don’t give me something, I will have you all killed!”\n\n“Thus proving my point. For every zebra you kill, you will create a small village of rebels. Murder has a way of getting zebras riled up.” General Zoblos did not even hear Zarishat’s final words, she already got up and left."
 colthage_coltvan.13.a:0 "We will find Zeirutid. No matter the cost."
 
 colthage_coltvan.14.t:0 "Nothing Can be Done"
 colthage_coltvan.14.d:0 "“I didn’t sign up for this, Za’al be my witness.” Captain Pazeb took a big sip from the bottle of rum on his desk and took a pen in his hoof. “Why did it have to be me?” Also on his desk were multiple files of alleged rebels. The last few days, after new instructions from the Commander of the East, the definition of rebel widened considerably. At the same time, the burden of proof needed lowered and the sentence for any rebellious act was heightened. Death would be the only acceptable sentence. But Captain Pazeb was convinced the general did not sign these sentences herself. Surely then she would understand the stress she had put her officers under with these orders!\n\nAfter another big sip of rum, the zebra took a paper in his hoof. “Sixteen. . . Not even an adult. Did not show up to his landlord for work three days ago. Known slacker. Three citizens testify suspicious behaviour. Yea, yea, I’m sure some bastard was looking for a way to fire you, young stallion. Poor sod.” With a flick of the pen Pazeb signed the death sentence.\n\n“Right, what have we here?” The next paper contained the details of an elderly mare. “Some sort of innkeeper? Already well above the age to retire. I don’t think she can hold a rifle anymore. Let’s hope no zebra will miss you. Nothing can be done.”\n\nA third. A fourth. A group of six. Then Captain Pazeb lost count. Nothing can be done. Ten more? Another zebra might be worse. How big was today’s stack? At least he cared. He’d say to himself. He would intervene. If it was something really bad. That’s why the captain had to play along. There would be a time to make his stand. Pazeb fantasised about his heroic intervention. But surely those Coltvans would understand. Nothing can be done right now."

 colthage_coltvan.15.t:0 "The Coltaran Camp"
 colthage_coltvan.15.d:0 "The newest structure in Coltaran was a compound surrounded by electric wire on the outskirts of the town. Ramshackle guard towers were manned day and night, overseeing the prisoners inside. Every day, columns of prisoners were marched into the camp. Some were wearing suits, some poor workers’ clothes. Young, old, stallion, mare. The only thing the prisoners shared was their Coltvan heritage and having been designated a ‘dangerous element’ by Jezbel Zoblos. The barracks the Coltvans had to sleep in were shoddily made and the beds were whatever the Colthaginian soldier could find for them. Despite his orders, newly promoted Camp Commander Pazeb worked with local farmers to get the prisoners as much food as he could. None of his subordinates protested. No soldier lifted a hoof when he arranged pickups for arrested foals. Most of the soldiers guarding the camp were silent, only speaking when communication was necessary. Then there were the few who were louder than ever. Who could not care for the judgemental looks of the others as they consumed their lust for power over the innocent.\n\nDespite following his orders in the most gentle way he could think of, Pazeb had noticed the latest afront by Zoblos had broken something among the Coltvans. For every ‘danger’ they’d arrest, there would be a retaliation. By now, the camp was the only safe place for Colthaginians in the entire city. He did not know how to respond. He did not have it in him to enact reprisals. The Commander did not want anything anymore. Perhaps it would be better if he went home? No. If Pazeb went home, home would be ruined as well. At least he, and the others, still had innocent memories of home. The Coltvans did not even have that. And they would have their revenge."

 CTH_internal_factions_desc:0 "The Sufrits cannot rule alone. Behind every leader there are powerful political groups keeping them in power. The §YZarcids§! that ruled over Colthage for decades cemented power with the aid of the §CScientifids§! and the §RMilitary§!. During this time the §GLandowners§! grew rich and powerful, and now extend strong control over their huge tracts of land.\n\nRecently two new organisations have been rising in popularity. §gConstitutionalists§! wish for a return to democratic government and an end to the Zarcas. The §PHarmonites§! go a step further, seeking to bring radical changes to the nation and rebuilding along harmonistic lines.\n\n§YLoyal factions will provide bonuses to the nation and disloyal factions will grind the nation to a halt. These bonuses or penalties increase with their power. However, powerful factions may make demands of the Sufrit, push their own agendas, or even plot against the Sufrit if they are disloyal.§!"

 CTH_SCIENTIFID_TOOLTIP:0 "The scientific clique is a group of academics who have been an influential faction since Zamilcar Zarca came to power. During his reign, they acted as technocratic advisors, reforming education and importing the industrial revolution to Colthage. The clique's members, commonly known as Scientifids, are proponents of positivist scientific politics. This means they value order and progress above all else.\n\nEach level of §YPower§! provides the following modifiers:\n2% Research Speed\n2% Production Efficiency Cap"
 CTH_MILITARY_FACTION_TOOLTIP:0 "While much of the Colthaginian army was scattered to the wind by the Storm King, the old generals from Zamilcar's time remain in charge. In the chaos following the invasion, these generals were responsible for re-establishing order in Colthage. They became warlords who rule over their forces like decadent kings. Yet they are also fiercely patriotic, ready to fight against anything that threatens Colthage. Anything.\n\nEach level of §YPower§! provides the following modifiers:\n2% Organization\n2% Surrender Limit"
 CTH_LANDOWNERS_TOOLTIP:0 "The rich landowning aristocrats of Colthage are a fairly new faction, whose wealth is tied to the powers they were given during Zamilcar's reign. Traditionally landowners have not been influential in Colthage, with the mercantile patricians dominating the nation, but things have changed. Zamilcar rewarded those loyal to him with sizeable grants of land, while Scientifids consolidated rural property into large estates. This created a new, proud class of landlords who dominate their leaseholders and slaves.\n\nEach level of §YPower§! provides the following modifiers:\n0.1 Political Power Gain\n2% Consumer Goods Factor"
 CTH_CONSTITUTIONALIST_TOOLTIP:0 "Constitutionalists have their roots in the establishment of the Colthaginian Republic almost two hundred years ago, when the ancient democratic constitution was restored and amended. But like other factions, they were formed during the reign of Zamilcar Zarca as an opposition to his dictatorial and oligarchic rule. Its members, many of whom are middle-class urbanites and patricians, seek to restore liberty and democracy to Colthage, but not necessarily bring about social and economic reforms.\n\nEach level of §YPower§! provides the following modifiers:\n10% Economy and Mobilization Law Cost"
 CTH_HARMONITES_TOOLTIP:0 "Harmonites are the youngest of all factions within Colthage and many still consider them to be a part of the constitutionalists. They are seen by some as radicals, influenced by foreign ideas from countries such as Hippogriffia and Equestria. They advocate for a welfare state where all zebras are equal. While the harmonites share the background of other constitutionalists, they have gained more popularity among the poor and downtrodden.\n\nEach level of §YPower§! provides the following modifiers:\n5% Stability Factor\n10% Trade Opinion Factor"
 CTH_LOYALTY_TOOLTIP:0 "§YFaction Loyalty§! represents a faction's relationship with the ruling government. Generally, if Loyalty drops below §Y50%§!, the Faction will become §RDisloyal§!. A loyal faction grants bonuses, while a disloyal faction gives maluses. Worst of all, a disloyal faction with high enough §YPower§! can launch a §RCoup§! to overthrow the government."
 CTH_POPULARITY_TOOLTIP:0 "§YFaction Powerbase§! represents a faction's level of influence in the nation and amount of support in the government. There are five levels of power, with higher levels providing stronger modifiers. While powerful factions can be beneficial, they can also be dangerous: A faction with §RVery High§! power will slowly lose loyalty, and a §RDisloyal§! faction can launch a §RCoup§! to overthrow the government."
