 ### LEADER DESCRIPTIONS ###
 POLITICS_ZALATHEL_ZARCA_DESC:0 "The son of Zamilcar Zarca, former-head of the powerful Zarca family and longest serving Consul of Colthage, Zalathel grew up in Colthaginian high-society during a period of peace and prosperity, however that all changed when the Storm King attacked.\n\nDespite joining his father in the defence of the city, the Storm King's forces proved to be overwhelming and Zalathel was forced to flee with his two brothers. The zebra went high into the Ponytus Mountains to lead a resistance group that plagued the Storm King's occupation. When news of the Storm King's death reached him, Zalathel lead the attack on Colthage itself and executed its puppet governors. With the city secure he was met as a liberator by many, but quickly and brutally cracked-down on any opposition. He turned to the warlords that had risen up throughout Colthage and those who would not step into line where quickly taken out.\n\nNow the new Consul, he has enough strength and support to keep power, but his position is a precarious one. Only time will tell if he will continue the legacy of his father, the position he was groomed for."

 ### EVENTS ###
 colthage_sicameon_murder.1.t:0 "A Murder in Scarlet"
 colthage_sicameon_murder.1.d:0 "Professor Balazar Zatid of the University of Colthage was found dead yesterday morning at an archaeological in the ancient Colthaginain colony of New Colthage located on the southern coast of the Scarlet. The professor was well renowned among the Colthaginian academic and archaeological communities and was a forerunner in early Colthaginian civilisation. He had travailed to the island of Scarlet to continue his work excavating the remains of the ancient Colthaginian town of New Colthage. Early reports say that he was found having been beaten, strangled, shot, and stabbed with his own pickaxe. Local authorities have yet to bring forth any suspects, but there is no doubt that this will spile into a major diplomatic incident between our two nations.\n\nColthage's ancient history in Griffonia has always been controversial to many Griffonians who reject the idea of any substantial Zebrican civilization on their continent, or even to meaningful interactions between our two worlds in the past. This flies in the face of complementary evidence that Professor Balazar Zatid and many others in both Colthage and Griffonia have uncovered, along with historical accounts and events, such as the famed Karthinian General Gripio Zebracanus who conquered the island of Scarlet for the Karthinian Republic over 1,500 years ago.\n\nSuch a crime has shocked the local community and the hunt for the perpetrators is still ongoing."
