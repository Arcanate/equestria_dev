TITLE_KIRIN_VANGUARD_SUBTITLE:0 "VANGUARDS"
tech_kirin_vanguard:0 "Kirin Vanguards"
tech_kirin_vanguard_desc:0 "The Vanguards once made up the front ranks of the Realm's professional army, serving as scouts and quick reinforcements to strike a hammer blow at the decisive moment of battle. Lightly armed and armored skirmishers, the Vanguards excel at moving through the nation's geography, and are capable of mounting stiff resistance in the forest."
tech_kirin_vanguard2:0 "Guerrilla Tactics"
tech_kirin_vanguard2_desc:0 "Stressing the importance of guerilla tactics during our Vanguards' training will allow them to infiltrate enemy lines as irregular groups, strike crucial targets, and then disappear before an effective response can be mounted."
tech_kirin_vanguard3:0 "Hit & Run"
tech_kirin_vanguard3_desc:0 "Hit & Run tactics allow our Vanguards to identify vulnerable points in our enemies' defenses and strike them with overwhelming firepower to cause devastating damage before a response can be mustered, earning crucial victories while minimizing the risk to our soldiers in the field."
tech_kirin_vanguardmot:0 "Motorized Vanguards"
tech_kirin_vanguardmot_desc:0 "Motorizing our Vanguard battalions will greatly increase their speed and range, in addition to providing a little extra protection when out in the field. This will allow our Vanguards to quickly respond to breaches in the line or provide crucial reinforcements in the pivotal moment of the fight."
tech_kirin_vanguardmot_tt:0 "\n£unit_kirin_vanguards_icon_small Vanguards will now require §YMotorized Equipment§!"
tech_kirin_vanguard4:0 "Scout Parties"
tech_kirin_vanguard4_desc:0 "The Vanguards are the scouts for the army, but who will scout for the scouts? Only the bravest kirin can be trusted with such a dangerous task, but the reconnaissance they perform will be crucial in helping our armies identify enemy movements and put up an effective fight."
tech_kirin_vanguard5:0 "Operational Autonomy"
tech_kirin_vanguard5_desc:0 "Our Vanguard units will be given broad objectives from the top, but the creation and execution of these plans will be left up to the battalion commanders. Eyes in the field see what eyes in the command room do not, and the flexibility to plan and organize appropriately will allow our Vanguards to quickly ready themselves for combat."
tech_kirin_vanguard6:0 "Compartmentalized Command"
tech_kirin_vanguard6_desc:0 "The Vanguards will have their own command structure dedicated to procuring the resources and plans they need to be a premier fighting force, and each battalion will have its own internal command structure that allows it to seamlessly receive and execute orders in the midst of a chaotic fight."
kirin_vanguards:0 "Vanguards"
kirin_vanguards_desc:0 "Light infantry best used for moving through plains, hills, and forests. Their bonus to initiative and improved speed over regular infantry allows them to quickly identify critical points in a fight and reinforce them to overwhelm defenders or blunt an attack."

TITLE_KIRIN_BRAVES_SUBTITLE:0 "VALIANTS"
tech_kirin_brave:0 "Kirin Valiants"
tech_kirin_brave_desc:0 "Valiants are rigorously trained and exceptionally disciplined warrior monks who have mastered their control of the nirik state. These monks, few in number but great in prowess, maintain control of their inner selves when wreathed in fire, allowing them to fight in coordination with normal soldiers and each other. The powers of the nirik state make them a terror to behold on the battlefield, and even armored vehicles cannot withstand the inferno raised from their channeled rage."
tech_kirin_brave2:0 "Professionalized Training"
tech_kirin_brave2_desc:0 "The Valiant warrior monks shall receive training in modern close-quarters combat tactics and participate in drills alongside the regular recruits, allowing disciplined monk and average soldier to work as one on the battlefield to increase the effectiveness of the division as a whole."
tech_kirin_brave3:0 "Dare To Die"
tech_kirin_brave3_desc:0 "The Valiants meditate before every battle for clarity of the mind and peace of the soul. Enhanced meditations shall teach them not to fear death, for they charge forth in Concord's brilliant glory and will either find strength in Her hottest fires or meet Her in their dying embers."
tech_kirin_brave4a:0 "Reconnaissance Focus"
tech_kirin_brave4a_desc:0 "Intense meditations while straddling the line between kirin and nirik are said to gift those that can walk this delicate balance visions of the future, bestowed by Concord Herself. The division shall always have at least one monk meditating at all times to see the future of their comrades in Her divine flames."
tech_kirin_brave4b:0 "Initiative Focus"
tech_kirin_brave4b_desc:0 "A warrior must be prepared to find battle at a moment's notice, and even without any notice whatsoever. Our Valiants shall remain ever-vigilant for fighting nearby and shall be the first to respond to any hostile actions, leading the way for the infantry behind them."
tech_kirin_brave5:0 "Spearhead Formation"
tech_kirin_brave5_desc:0 "Arranging our Valiants in a spearhead formation at the leading thrust of a charge shall allow them to sow havoc and chaos amongst enemy lines during an attack, allowing the regular infantry to push through with lessened resistance and fewer casualties overall."
tech_kirin_brave6:0 "The Cream of the Crop"
tech_kirin_brave6_desc:0 "Nothing means nothing when we are talking about the rise to the top. Soldiers in combat will find themselves justifiably in a position they'd rather not be in. But the cream will rise to the top. On balance, off balance, it doesn't matter. We are on the way, and nothing is going to stop us."
kirin_braves:0 "Valiants"
kirin_braves_desc:0 "Warrior monks that can master the nirik state to support the divisions they are attached to. It is extremely difficult to train and prepare these monks for front line combat, and so they should be used sparingly when training time is of the essence. However, their nirik forms will greatly increase a division's ability to break through enemy lines and destroy lightly armored targets they come up against."
