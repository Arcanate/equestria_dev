### Events ###
bandit.17.t:0 "Blackrock's Health"
bandit.17.d:0 "Recently, Blackrock has been showing signs of deteriorating health. While it wasn't that big of a problem in the past, now it has gotten to the point where she needs doctors on standby at any moment. The only reason she's still alive at this very moment is because of her closest friends, keeping her safe and secured, as well as keeping the bandits from killing each other in her absence. It's only a matter of time now before she dies, and only a miracle would save her."
bandit.17.a:0 "She'll die regardless of what we do, so we should just let her die."
bandit.17.b:0 "And a miracle is exactly what shall happen."

bandit.18.t:0 "A Message from Bluecrest"
bandit.18.d:0 "On a calm afternoon, a courier arrived in Reeve's office carrying with him a special message, apparently sent directly by Bluecrest himself. The contents of the message contained mostly insults, but the important part of the message was the request for a duel. It would be held at midnight only a day from now. We are expected to go along with this duel, as it is tradition."
bandit.18.a:0 "We shall meet at midnight then, in the outskirts of Murkbeak."
bandit.18.b:0 "Screw tradition, we shall not entertain the wishes of monarchist scum."

bandit.19.t:0 "The Duel"
bandit.19.d:0 "Bluecrest arrived at the meeting spot shortly after you did, bringing with him an old sword. You had brought along with you a sword of similar make, one that you used to kill many a bandit with. The two of you stare each other down whilst a nearby griffon cocks a gun, raising it high up in the sky. At the count of three, he fires it, and the two of you begin the duel."
bandit.19.a:0 "The fight is long and hard, but you are unable to keep up with Bluecrest's superior skills."
bandit.19.b:0 "You quickly take down Bluecrest in only a few strikes after breaking his defenses."

bandit.21.t:0 "Alliance Request from the PRB"
bandit.21.d:0 "The People's Republic of Blackrock have requested an alliance! We would both mutually guarantee each other, creating a defensive pact to better defend against anti-communist enemies in the region."
bandit.21.a:0 "Accept."
bandit.21.b:0 "Decline."

bandit.22.t:0 "The GRW has Accepted!"
bandit.22.d:0 "We are now officially in a defensive pact with the GRW. We will assist them if they are attacked, and they shall assist us if we are attacked."
bandit.22.a:0 "Excellent."

bandit.23.t:0 "The GRW has Declined!"
bandit.23.d:0 "Unfortunately, the GRW has declined our request."
bandit.23.a:0 "Damn."
