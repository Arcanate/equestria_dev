BAN_civilize_blackhollow_desc:0 "As much as we love to lord over the peasants, scaring them straight every other week, sooner or later they're going to start off a real revolt.

BAN_bandit_kingdom_of_the_south_desc:0 "To those "civilised" nations in the north, we seem like an anomaly, something that isn't supposed to exist. We scoff at their prejudice!

BAN_speak_with_the_empire_desc:0 "The Griffonian Empire has gone through some rough times, but they're still the undisputed military might in central Griffonia. We should appeal to them for aid in restoring order to the lands of Blackhollow. Even if it means we'll owe them a favour or two."

"As you may know, civil war has been going on for years now in Prywhen, and both sides are using drastic measures to achieve total victory. This means, however, that they are weak, and won't be able to resist if we were to invite ourselves to their lands and do some... shopping. What say you louts, shall we invade or not?" \n\nAs she expected, her griffons promptly started loudly arguing with one another over the course of action, some even engaging in improptu brawls, while others were screaming that the lands of Prywhen were a "Maar-blasted hellhole" that should be avoided at all costs. By the Gods, she hated when they started bickering like chicks. Taking out her pistol, she fired a shot to the ceiling, an another hole joining the others.

From what we could piece together, Gaston, a notoriously dim griffon, was attempting to extort a tribute from the villagers. After they could offer nothing but the clothes off their backs and old grain, Gaston, in a fit of rage, ordered his griffons to slaughter and raze the village to the ground. Afterward, he was strutting around and telling to anyone who'd listed, that they had it coming for being poor."

bandit.16.d:0 "Our firefighters - who also serve as racketeers, bodyguards and fences, among others - had their claws full last night, after an arms factory had suddenly caught fire and burned down to the foundations. Investigation has revealed that during their evening shift, the slacking workers decided to cut their time with drunken revelry. One thing led to another, and the fun quickly ended after they attempted to discover what happens if you were to mix gunpowder, alcohol and a stack of matches."

bandit.18.t:0 "Influx of Drugs"
bandit.18.d:0 "The trafficking drug ring has lately had a surge of success, and perhaps, luck. The plants' yield has been higher than average, and with that, we were able to sell more. The boss will be pleased with the profits, she's been eyeing some fine jewelry lately..."

We've been planning a large trade with one of the biggest Wingbardian mafias for a while - and these birds don't mess around - but few days before the trade was set to take place, we've discovered our stock of drugs has been significantly depleted. The guards swear by their lives that no thief got past them, nor did they indulge in vices - but the fact remains that the Wingbardians will be severely displeased if we renege on our deal. Replenishing our stock on such a quick notice will cut heavily into our profit margin."
bandit.19.a:0 "Of all the..."

bandit.20.t:0 "Raid on the Poncy Nobles"
bandit.20.d:0 "The old nobility that ruled this land long ago has been and still is a thorn in our side. They hide in their mountain holds, plotting their return. While their schemes are nothing but a flight of fancy, to say the least, they still contest our rule and rouse the peasants into committing acts of rebellion. Thus, to teach them a lesson, we've raided one of the weaker holds and depleted it of its inhabitants. The late noble was so kind to leave us a large amount of precious stones and ornaments."
bandit.20.a:0 "I'd like some of that, yes."

bandit.21.t:0 "Caravan Plundered"
bandit.21.d:0 "Everygriff should know that pride marks your end. In a bold attempt, a trade caravan carrying various semi-precious goods, such as imported food, foreign texts, rare materials from Aquileia and so on, has attempted to take a shortcut through our country in order to secure a larger reward from their clients. Needless to say, while their escapade worked for a few days, after our patrols discovered them they were quickly seized and their puny protection was cut down. Should have known better than going through Blackrock's land."
bandit.21.a:0 "Prey stepping into the trap willingly? Amusing."

bandit.22.t:0 "Bandit Infighting"
bandit.22.d:0 "Victory does not always guarantee success in the end, unfortunately. Following a successful raid on a Falconese port town, our raiders started squabbling over dividing the loot. Tensions flared up, rivalries were brought to light, and afterward a shootout occured in which most of our griffons perished. The survivors, driven by greed and fear, seized all of the spoils and have reneged on their oath to Blackrock."

bandit.23.t:0 "The Raid on Blackrock's Treasury"
bandit.23.d:0 "Blackrock has always had a habit for keeping track of her victories. So much, that she has made a trophy room in her makeshift mansion, which she frequently visits and reminiscences about the good times. It is, of course, heavily guarded by her most loyal bandits. \n\nAnd yet, this did not deter a flock of foreign criminals who had immigrated here recently. Showing that there is no honour among thieves, these daring griffons have plotted to abscond with the boss' riches for a long time, and last night, their efforts came to success as they stole Blackrock's entire stash of stolen jewelry - which she enjoys taking from those stiff necked nobles - and fled as quickly as they came. The guards were stumped at being so egregiously duped, and did not have a good day once Blackrock found out..."

Her followers were dedicated and loyal, for all their vices, and her spoils have been growing ever larger. And yet... she began feeling bored of the conventional extravagance. She's been sitting on her rear for long enough, it's time to do something productive instead of making coin castles or playing Stalliongradian roulette.

Years ago the surrounding foreboding forests were infested with bandits who prepared occasional raids, but now those same vagabonds occupied the castle itself, having turned it into a ramshackle nest of debauchery and crime.\n\nNow the tables had turned and the nobles themselves prepared in the forest to retake Blackhollow, the former capital. First the town was surrounded with raiding parties emerging from the forest and cutting off any road connections to it, then some cannons were set up on the opposite side of the river. The bombardment began and drove the bandits into the castle, allowing the Countess' griffons to seize the town. The precious castle would not be damaged and was instead left alone. The criminal scum stuck inside would eventually starve and surrender. Countess Cyrille, who had led the attacking forces personally, sat on the old throne of the Bluecrest Counts and almost cried from joy. She was back home."

There, they could prepare for their attack peacefully, unseen by Blackrock's scum. A series of surprise raids cut off all roads leading to the town of Blackhollow, and sharpshooters secured the riverbanks, shooting any bandit ships sailing down the river. As Reeve lead his followers to attack the town, the cowardly bandits retreated into the castle, the old symbol of feudal oppression. Reeve immediately ordered cannons to be set up for the complete demolishment of the building. After three days of bombardment, nothing remained except a pile of smouldering rubble and corpses."

The capital of the region, Murkbeak, has grown after Blackrock's wicked reign began and is now the largest town in the country. It is a vile hive of scum and villainy, filled with the worst Griffonkind has to offer. While Blackrock never stays in one place for long, the closest thing to her "home" is in the center of Murkbeak, where she stores her trophies.\n\nThe battle of Murkbeak would be hard, yet if the Countess took it, it would be a great victory that would shatter the morale of the bandit scum. Farmers around the town, who gave away most of their food as tribute to the criminals, eagerly joined the Countess when her forces arrived in the region. Soon enough bandit outposts had been destroyed and Murkbeak was surrounded by a large host of angry griffons. Cyrille was confident, but then she saw that Blackrock herself was leading the defenders and organized a solid defence, with many barricades on the streets and snipers on the roofs. The battle would be bloody.\n\nThree times the Countess' supporters attacked, and three times they were repulsed. Some machine guns stolen from Falcor had been set up and in the center of the town there was an artillery battery seized from Angriver. Hundreds died, mostly on the Countess' side. It was clear a direct assault could only end in failure, so instead the Countess tried a different approach. In the nearby marshes, packs of Hydras prowled. They could easily regenerate their wounds and did not fear the sound of gunshots. The Countess sent a group of her soldiers to harass and lure the Hydras away from the swamps into Murkbeak. The plan worked and soon the bandits fled in droves as massive hydras tore through their lines, still alive even as some of their heads were torn apart by artillery shells, constantly regenerating their wounds. The rampage lasted for several hours. After the Hydras were finally killed, some by Blackrock herself, it was followed by a swift attack by the Countess' forces. The bandits were utterly defeated and flew away, some being shot in mid-air. Blackrock managed to escape but her own fortress was looted bare."

While Blackrock never stays in one place for long, the closest thing to her "home" is in the center of Murkbeak, where she stores her trophies.\n\nReeve knew taking Murkbeak from the bandit oppressors would be difficult, at least if they tried attacking from the outside. His scouts reported that Blackrock herself was leading the defenders and organized a solid defence, with many barricades on the streets and snipers on the roofs. But an attack from within combined with an attack from beyond would surely crush their defence. He sent griffons to the surrounding countryside to recruit farmers, who gave away most of their food as tribute to the criminals, and also sent infiltrators and spies into Murkbeak disguised as criminals. There they told the local enslaved servants and workers that their liberation would come, but only if they took up arms and fought.\n\nWhen Reeve attacked, Blackrock was ready for him. Some machine guns stolen from Falcor had been set up and in the center of the town there was an artillery battery seized from Angriver. But she was not ready for the attack from behind her lines as the proles rose up, armed with tools and stolen guns. She had to split her defence and fight on two fronts, which soon proved to be unwinnable. Nevertheless Reeve's revolutionaries and the rebelling servants took hundreds of casualties and paid dearly. Blackrock herself managed to wound Reeve in the eye with an accurate rifle shot. But soon she realized that the battle was lost and her bandits fled in droves, flying away from the town. She cursed Reeve's name and fled as well rather than fighting to the last. Afterwards Reeve, with a bandage on his eye, raised the red flag of revolution on top of Blackrock's fortress and proclaimed Murkbeak to be the new capital of the commune. Soldiers and rebels alike cheered and celebrated the arrival of equality in Murkbeak."

bandit.31.t:0 "Skirmish in Creeper Mountains"
bandit.31.d_neutral:0 "Over two centuries ago, the most famous event in the long history of the Creeper Mountains took place as Grover I crossed them with his vast army. The eastern principalities had expected him to attack from the north or the south, and they were completely taken by surprise as Grover invaded from the west and occupied their towns and cities. It is said the castle in Highhall was built by his engineers to guard the pass he used and ensure no one in the east would try to use it like he had done. Nowadays it was a bandit stronghold where they prepared raids to Cyanolisia and Sicameon.\n\nCapturing Highhall and driving the bandits away from the Creeper Mountains would be difficult, so the Countess picked the finest mountaineers and the bravest fliers from the ranks of her soldiers for a two-pronged assault on Highhall. One company would attack from above, another from the valley below. This plan worked well: As the bandits focused on repelling the mountaineers, they were ambushed from the skies and could not use cover to hide from the sudden onslaught. The castle was taken after brutal close quarters combat, from the top floor to the bottom. Several days passed as the soldiers then surveyed the surrounding mountains and destroyed scattered bandit hideouts."

It is said the castle in Highhall was built by his engineers to guard the pass he used and ensure no one in the east would try to use it like he had done. Nowadays it was a bandit stronghold where they prepared raids to Cyanolisia and Sicameon.\n\nLiberation of Creeper Mountains would be hard to accomplish, but Reeve was not afraid or filled with doubt. To show an example to his soldiers, he would personally lead the daring attack south. He gathered most of the revolutionaries as he believed numbers were necessary for victory, and one by one captured scattered bandit outposts in the mountains before only Highhall remained, its garrison too bold to surrender. Reeve decided to use his single advantage and attacked from above, leading all his numerous soldiers in a large swarm that blotted out the sun. The bandit sharpshooters on rooftops were shaken, especially when their gunfire did little to stop the attackers. The cloud of revolutionaries descended upon Highhall, slaughtering the outnumbered bandits with ease and besieging the castle. The few defenders inside held out for two weeks before running out of food and surrendering. Their wings were cut off and they were thrown down from the cliff as Reeve raised the red flag atop the castle."
bandit.31.a:0 "The south is free once more."

bandit.32.t:0 "Clearing Out Banditplace"
bandit.32.d_neutral:0 "Banditplace is where it all began. For centuries these sparsely populated and tall mountains have been infested with criminals who prey on griffons of nearby regions. So infamous was this bandit infestation that the area was named after it. Civilization is a foreign concept here, with the largest settlements being crime-ridden gatherings of shacks nested in valleys or sprawled upon mountaintops. This is where Blackrock grew up and where her takeover began all those years ago. So fittingly, her reign of terror will now end where it began.\n\nCountess Cyrille began a task that her predecessors should've done long ago. She organized her finest soldiers into squads of bandit-hunters and trained them to fight with the same guerilla tactics their enemy used. Then the soldiers were sent out to purge Banditplace. They made sure to only attack during night-time, and use hit-and-run raids to cause as much damage as possible while taking minimal casualties in return. Bandit groups were ambushed in the dales and snipers occupied the peaks. The bandit outposts were burnt and slain foes crucified to set an example. Soon enough bandits began to flee the region in droves, taking their ill-gotten goods with them. Some remained, hiding in caverns and secret tunnels, but Banditplace was now mostly in the Countess' claws."

This is where Blackrock grew up and where her takeover began all those years ago. So fittingly, her reign of terror will now end where it began.\n\nTo Reeve, the fact that the Counts of Blackhollow had done nothing about the problem of Banditplace simply proved the decadence and laziness of the nobility. Now a new age would begin in the nation and it would be heralded with the purging of Banditplace. The criminal pockets and hideouts were many, but they were scattered, and in the end Reeve had more than enough angry peasants on his side who were tired of being raided, robbed and extorted. So he assembled a mighty host to march eastwards and fill the valleys like a feathered flood. The small and spread out settlements stood no chance on their own, and one by one they fell. In the end some organized resistance formed, but by then it was too little too late. The red tide washed over them and those who survived fled across the border."
bandit.32.a:0 "Perhaps this place can be renamed soon."

bandit.33.t:0 "Liberation of Naniwich"
bandit.33.d_neutral:0 "While most of Blackhollow is very mixed culturally, with Wingbardian, Sicamean and Prywhenian all being spoken, inhabitants of Naniwich strongly identify as Herzlander griffons and are fiercely independent, having been autonomous during the Counts' reign. They put up a stiff resistance against Blackrock before their militias were finally crushed and have been plotting a revolt.\n\nWhen news spread that the Countess' uprising had begun, Naniwich griffons finally put their plans into motion. Bandit garrisons were surrounded and attacked, with many of them being completely destroyed even before the Countess' soldiers entered the region. Then commanders of the two militia forces met and planned a combined offensive against the bandits. In return, Cyrille promised to reinstate Naniwich autonomy. The cooperation proved fruitful as the scattered bandits stood no chance against them. Soon enough Naniwich was free once more."

They put up a stiff resistance against Blackrock before their militias were finally crushed and have been plotting a revolt.\n\nWhile inhabitants of Naniwich hated bandits, they did not like communists either, and were hesitant to join them when Reeve launched his northern offensive. Only after the revolutionaries had shed much blood and defeated several bandit outposts and warbands did the Naniwich griffons finally launch their attack. With Blackrock's goons surprised from the flank, they could offer little resistance and were soon defeated. But after the victory Naniwich towns were still very hesitant about letting Reeve's forces come close and after some violent skirmishes Reeve signed an agreement with local leaders that granted them considerable autonomy."
