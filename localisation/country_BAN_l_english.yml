BAN_black_market_mercs_desc:0 "With the ongoing instability across Griffonia, bands of mercenaries have sprung up like weeds.

BAN_equal_labor:0 "No Ownership"
BAN_equal_labor_desc:0 "Ownership is a cruel concept that only causes us to compete with each other, driven by envy. How can we strive to achieve true equality if we fight amongst ourselves? Starting now, nogriff owns anything, and everything will be shared, for the good of our community."

bandit.1.d:0 ""Gentlegriffs.", Blackrock adressed the crowd in what she liked to call the war room, which was merely a barren spacious room that had a large map of the region nailed to the wall. "As you may know, civil war has been going on for years now in Prywhen, and both sides are using drastic measures to achieve total victory. This means, however, that they are weak, and won't be able to resist if we were to invite ourselves to their lands and do some... shopping. What say you louts, shall we invade or not?" \n\nAs she expected, her griffons promptly started loudly arguing with one another over the course of action, some even engaging in improptu brawls, while others were screaming that the lands of Prywhen were a "Maar-blasted hellhole" that should be avoided at all costs. By the Gods, she hated when they started bickering like chicks. Taking out her pistol, she fired a shot to the ceiling, an another hole joining the others.
