### Ideas ###
GFS_commandos:0 "The Kommando System"
GFS_commandos_desc:0 "When the Kompels first settled in the rolling hills and valleys of the Vrystaat and Talonsvaal they found a hostile land filled with nothing but Tribals that wished to see them dead and gone.\n\n With little to no military support from their distant Fatherland, the various Kompel farmsteads and mining towns began relying on local militias for protection; With the creation of the two Kompel Republics, these militias would go on to form the backbone of the Kommando system.\n\n Keeping in line with their militia roots each town has it's own Kommando unit comprised primarily of local griffons between the ages of 16 and 60, these units usually comprised of several dozen griffons are under the command of a local veldkornet who in turn answers to the regional kommandant.\n\n While the Kommando System has proven its worth time and time again; at its core it is still just a glorified system of local militias. This fact has made many within our general staff rather nervous about our prospects in fighting in any sort of conventional wars.\n\n Having this national spirit will allow you to raise local §YKommando§! units if you are fighting a §RDefensive War§!"
GFS_freedom:0 "The Vrygesebra Issue"
GFS_freedom_desc:0 "In 989 the Emansipasie Proklamasie was officially pushed through the Vrystaat Volksraad, thus ending both slavery and indentured servitude as instituitons within our fair Republic.\n\n Unfortunatley the rather sudden emancipation of any and all Zebra servants and slaves has lead to the creation of a new class; the so called Vrygesebras.\n\n These invidivuals, often former Zebra servants and slaves, or the descendants of said sevants and slaves lack practically any form of political representation or income, thus forcing many of them to turn to a life of crime in an effort to make ends meet."
GFS_economic_upturn:0 "Economic Upturn"
GFS_economic_upturn_desc:0 "With our status as one of the few industrial nations in South-Eastern Zebrica we have been able to drastically  boost our economy in the last couple of years by selling industrial goods to our by far less civilized neighbours"
