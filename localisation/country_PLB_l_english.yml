PLB_yearly_review:0 "The Yearly Review"
PLB_yearly_review_desc:0 "For the half-decade that polar bears have been united under the blessed protection of Paw Wellington the country has been pushed towards modernity and perhaps even uniformity year by year. And some time after a new year comes, the newborn bureaucracy would present their report to the despot. The time has come for the fifth such report."

PLB_treasury_report:0 "The Treasury Situation"
PLB_treasury_report_desc:0 "While the implementation of the modernization programs have been rather... subpar... That can be carried into the following year. What’s important is that we have resources to continue them. It’s a good thing then, that we should still have plenty of resources to push these endeavours forwards."

PLB_request_financial_support:0 "Request Financial Support From Other Clans"
PLB_request_financial_support_desc:0 "Sadly, with the quite unexpected material situation at hand, we are forced to step down from our position of Clan Scyfling superiority and domination and request for material support from subjugated clans. We can only hope that this does not shatter the image of superiority and even divine favour we have formed."

PLB_establish_tax_system:0 "Take What We Need"
PLB_establish_tax_system_desc:0 "If they do not respond to politeness and friendly requests, perhaps they will respond to law and force. We will not ask anymore, we will take! The state needs to modernize to survive, and to modernize it needs resources, scribes and soldiers. And if we have to, All Father willing, we will take what we need with an iron paw!"

PLB_united_polar_bear_army:0 "Create a United Polar Bear Army"
PLB_united_polar_bear_army_desc:0 "For now the military of our country is comprised from Clan Scyfling warbands. This was a mistake as it seems it led to the other nine clans forgetting that they are our subordinates and have their own duties. Perhaps they won’t be so willing to forget when it becomes the duty to fight for the country under the leadership of Paw too."

PLB_nationalize_fish_farms:0 "Begin Nationalization of Fish Farms"
PLB_nationalize_fish_farms_desc:0 "One of the first things Paw Wellington did after his conquests was making the ownership of coastal fish farms more fair or in some cases even distributing clan Scyfling fish to less fortunate clans. This was not just an act of kindness, but also a show of power. Whoever controls the fish trade and capture controls the bears. Thus we must control most of the fish."

PLB_combined_research_initiatives:0 "Start Combined Research Initiatives"
PLB_combined_research_initiatives_desc:0 "While there is much we can learn from abroad, there is similarly as much that can be learned from within. Many clans produce and use unique adaptations of various technologies which should be spread to become accessible to all bears. For this noble goal we will demand that artisans of other clans are sent to our fortresses and teach us their knowledge so we can spread it across the North."

PLB_the_outcast_question:0 "The Outcast Question"
PLB_the_outcast_question_desc:0 "They might act arrogant and superior to us, now that they mocked our pride, our dreams and the concept of a great united bear state. But we still control the borders and they don’t. If we can’t get support and help from bears at home, we will just take it from the bears abroad. We will open up the borders and accept the countless exiles that roam the world back home."

PLB_scyfling_shall_not_surrender:0 "We Will Not Yield, We Will Nor Surrender!"
PLB_scyfling_shall_not_surrender_desc:0 "It has been less than a decade, yet again our clan is pitted against the rest of our kind again. But just like the last time All-Father willing, we will not surrender or yield until all of polar bears are yet again united by Clan Scyfling."

PLB_seize_their_fish_farms:0 "Restore the Fish Farms"
PLB_seize_their_fish_farms_desc:0 "The destroyed and sabotaged fish farms have been a bit of an issue we have neglected to address due to ever increasing issues before the collapse. However we can’t afford to do that any longer. The fish farms all across our owned lands must become operation again so that we may never find ourselves lacking."

PLB_strenghten_local_alliances:0 "Forge Local Alliances"
PLB_strenghten_local_alliances_desc:0 "There are many ice forts or even larger fortresses that are inhabited not by any of the great clans, but rather by lesser outcasts or those whose bloodlines never belonged to any clans. We have previously mostly ignored their interests and part to play in united bear state. However that can still be fixed."

PLB_storm_their_fortresses:0 "Storm Their Fortresses"
PLB_storm_their_fortresses_desc:0 "While most of northwest of bear lands is owned and controlled by Clan Scyfling or bears lacking clan alignment there are still quite a few locations where the claws of Onlatir or Wesslandian clans stretch among what is ours. We must ensure we won’t be struck in the back and thus their castles and forts must fall!"

PLB_northwest_reclaimed:0 "Finish The Reclamation of the Northwest"
PLB_northwest_reclaimed_desc:0 "Fish are being caught in great numbers again. Larger and larger armies are being raised. And any presence of other clans that presents a danger to us has been eliminated. Now we can march outwards!"

PLB_the_march_west:0 "March West"
PLB_the_march_west_desc:0 "The fact that there was anything left that could revolt in Eastern Key Lake after the clans that persisted there were pushed out into the Changeling lands for their treason is quite surprising. Reclaiming it should not be an issue."

PLB_gaze_south:0 "Turn our Gaze South"
PLB_gaze_south_desc:0 "Onlatir is an unforgiving land. Distant from the nourishing sea and even most rivers or lakes. Though it’s long history invaded by changelings, rogue yak warbands, other bear clans and even a few failed griffon expeditions. No wonder such land has bred three entire clans of fearsome warriors…"

PLB_negotiations_with_clan_Kane:0 "Attempt Negotiations with Clan Kane"
PLB_negotiations_with_clan_Kane_desc:0 "Clan Kane is a rather strong force, being the only clan whose troops can match the fearsome Svartpels in melee combat and perhaps even possessing greater endurance. Subjugating them was hard before. But perhaps as a show of good faith and understanding, we can defeat them by word and not claw…"

PLB_negotiations_with_clan_goltung:0 "Attempt Negotiations with Clan Gotlung"
PLB_negotiations_with_clan_goltung_desc:0 "Even in the unforgiving land of Onlatir, clan Gotlung was in the worst position. And yet they endure in their great forts and with their great shields. It took a long time to bombard them into submission the last time, though perhaps they don’t want their new fortresses bombarded into dust again and would rather talk it out?"

PLB_negotiations_with_clan_rozenkrantz:0 "Attempt Negotiations with Clan Rozenkrantz"
PLB_negotiations_with_clan_rozenkrantz_desc:0 "The shaman ruled Clan Rozenkrantz gazes into the northern winds and channels the power of winter itself like no other. It was only through outmanoeuvring and overpowering them we won. Something that took two great clans to complete. Perhaps we can convince them to gaze into northern winds and see our fates align?"

PLB_subjugate_clan_Kane:0 "Subjugation of Clan Kane"
PLB_subjugate_clan_Kane_desc:0 "Clan Kane of Onlatir might be comprised of proud and great warriors, each one perhaps being able to match any two  or even three belonging to other clans. Yet we made them kneel once, and we can do it again!"

PLB_subjugate_clan_goltung:0 "Subjugation of Clan Gotlung"
PLB_subjugate_clan_goltung_desc:0 "Clan Gotlung might think of themselves unreachable beyond their great walls once again, their fortresses rising higher than ebfore. They had done the same last time we marched across the North uniting bears under a single banner. It didn’t help them then, most likely won’t help them now."

PLB_subjugate_clan_rozenkrantz:0 "Subjugation of Clan Rozenkrantz"
PLB_subjugate_clan_rozenkrantz_desc:0 "Clan Rozenkrantz have refined their magical crafts like none among our kind have seen before during these 5 years. However we know the blessing of the divine is stronger than any magic of a mortal. Even if they think things have changed, they could never defeat the armies blessed by the divine."

PLB_destroy_clan_Kane:0 "Destroy Clan Kane"
PLB_destroy_clan_Kane_desc:0 "There is nothing noble in what we must do, but it must be done . The great warriors of clan Kane will be slain till the last by our might. None will survive to resist. Only guilt and regret will persist."

PLB_destroy_clan_goltung:0 "Destroy Clan Gotlung"
PLB_destroy_clan_goltung_desc:0 "It is brutal and wasteful, perhaps even absurd, but there is no other choice left to us... The great walls of Gotlung will collapse onto them, burying all beneath them, leaving only haunted ruin behind."

PLB_destroy_clan_rozenkrantz:0 "Destroy Clan Rozenkrantz"
PLB_destroy_clan_rozenkrantz_desc:0 "The northern winds will howl and fire will roar, but the blizzard of Rozenkratz shamanic might will go out. An entire legacy snuffed out, leaving the messages of the hales impossible to comprehend."

PLB_pacify_south:0 "The South is Ours"
PLB_pacify_south_desc:0 "Onlatir rests beneath the banner of Scyfling again, just like it did recently. However now the land of proud warriors and great shamans is truly devoted to our cause, something which we were unable to ensure the last time through our foolishness. But now, now we can be sure that there won’t be any more revolts."

PLB_gaze_east:0 "Turn our Gaze East"
PLB_gaze_east_desc:0 "Unexpectedly and perhaps in a surprise to not just us but everyone across the bear lands, the three clans of plentiful Wesslandia have aligned with each other, forging a sort of alliance of equals. Such a system has never been seen before among the bears and let’s hope that it has it’s faults, for if Wesslandia truly rises united, we would simply not have the numbers to stand a chance!"

PLB_negotiations_with_triple_alliance:0 "Attempt Negotiations with The Triple Alliance"
PLB_negotiations_with_triple_alliance_desc:0 "The so called "Triple Alliance" of Wesslandia is truly a foe too great to meet on the battlefield. While a position of equals is quite horrible when it comes to negotiations between bears, we can only hope that Wesslandians had taken up a more pragmatic position on such matters from their griffon servants."

PLB_besiege_the_triple_alliance:0 "Besiege the Triple Alliance"
PLB_besiege_the_triple_alliance_desc:0 "A united Wesslandian would crush us easily. Yet with how the region is positioned, surrounded on all sides by enemies, be they one of the great bear clans or griffons, they could never fight us as equals. And thus one victory will pile on top of another until we will reach the other side of the bountiful Wesslandia."

PLB_shatter_the_alliance:0 "Butcher The Triple Alliance"
PLB_shatter_the_alliance_desc:0 "Wesslandia had united by itself, rose from formerly rival clans… They resisted us before, but now, with all that we have done? They would never accept our rule and we could never contain them… Only one option is left. To snuff out an entire region… Let’s hope the gods forgive us, because we could never forgive ourselves…"

PLB_pacify_east:0 "The East is Ours"
PLB_pacify_east_desc:0 "The plentiful and great Wesslandia now rests beneath our claws. Despite it’s recent unification into a force which might have challenged and even defeated us, had All Father not blessed us, we were the ones who emerged triumphant against what would in any other case be impossible odds! And this time, our grip will persist for sure."

PLB_prepare_for_the_final_struggle:0 "Prepare for The Final Push"
PLB_prepare_for_the_final_struggle_desc:0 "We might have eliminate the threat the lesser clans had posed for us, yet to confront the great Clan Volsungr and fearsome Clan Svartpels we will need to prepare as much as possible. We will raise new forces and fortify our new borders in preparation for retribution and a great push."

PLB_question_of_clan_volsungr:0 "Question of Clan Volsungr"
PLB_question_of_clan_volsungr_desc:0 "Clan Volsungr is perhaps quite the anomaly within the polar bear territories. They used to be a rival to our former comrades in Svartpels, which meant that during the previous unification they lost extremely brutally. This forced them to accept many outcasts, which changed them, transformed them even. It is difficult to even think what would be the best way do deal with them now."

PLB_attempt_negotiations_with_clan_volsungr:0 "Attempt Negotiations with Harmonists of Volsungr"
PLB_attempt_negotiations_with_clan_volsungr_desc:0 "Under their new "princess" - Eira, Clan Volsungr has redefined itself in an imitation of Equestrian rule. Perhaps the sort of Equestrian pacifism and desire to forgive has translated too? Maybe they would be willing to talk this out?"

PLB_subjugation_of_clan_volsungr:0 "Attempt Subjugation of Volsungr Harmonists"
PLB_subjugation_of_clan_volsungr_desc:0 "Clan Volsungr was made to kneel once. This will repeat again. No matter how much they copy Equestria, they will not be able to match the tactical prowess we learned from our years of exile in Griffonia."

PLB_destroy_of_clan_volsungr:0 "Bombard Volsungr Mountain Holds to Duts"
PLB_destroy_of_clan_volsungr_desc:0 "With what we have done, the Equestrian copy cats that are Clan Volsungr would never align with us and would never submit to us. The only way to ensure an enemy army is hiding in those mountains, is to collapse them onto the Volsung fortress within… Let’s hope the forged future is bright enough to justify this."

PLB_volsungr_defeated:0 "Yak Mountains are Ours"
PLB_volsungr_defeated_desc:0 "The mountains that separate our lands from the Yaks are said to be impossible to break through and fight in. Yet in our advance against Volsungr, we have subjugated these great mountains too."

PLB_question_of_clan_svartpels:0 "Question of Clan Svartpels"
PLB_question_of_clan_svartpels_desc:0 "Clan Svartpels were our most faithful allies during the first unification. Furthermore their elder - the Lord of Storms Torben was a good, if distant friend to Paw Wellington. Yet now we stand opposed..."

PLB_attempt_negotiations_with_clan_svartpels:0 "Try a Peaceful Option with Svartpels"
PLB_attempt_negotiations_with_clan_svartpels_desc:0 "Clan Svartpels seems to believe that our mistakes are not our own faults but rather some sort of changeling driven conspiracy. With this in mind, if we can indeed convince them to join us as brothers in arms and our staunches friends and allies again."

PLB_subjugation_of_clan_svartpels:0 "Make the Lords of Thunder Kneel Again"
PLB_subjugation_of_clan_svartpels_desc:0 "While the belief of Clan Svartpels that our mistakes are nothing more than some foreign inspired conspiracy. This is reassuring as it means if we prove we are true bears they will most likely align us again. However for Svartpels and Torben, the only way to prove such a thing would be through war…"

PLB_destroy_of_clan_svartpels:0 "Thunder And Lightning Will Not Save Them"
PLB_destroy_of_clan_svartpels_desc:0 "With how much they seem to be convinced everything bad is a conspiracy of changelings they will simply never accept what we did or why. There is an immense grief in having to turn on old friends. Yet for the future of bearkind it has to be done."

PLB_svartpels_defeated:0 "The North is Peaceful"
PLB_svartpels_defeated_desc:0 "Even the great Northern Shores now bend to the will of Paw Wellington and Clan Scyfling! Truly, if we can yet again reach our claw across this unbearable domain, our future should be blessed by the frost and spirits of our ancestors."

PLB_scyfling_victorious:0 "A Scyfling Victory"
PLB_scyfling_victorious_desc:0 "Yet again, for the second time in less than a decade, Clan Scyflings under Paw Wellington stands as the undisputed leaders of polar bear race. And this time, our dominion is unquestionable."





PLB_scyfling_has_no_honor:0 "Our Allies have Failed"
PLB_scyfling_has_no_honor_desc:0 "The absurd and the impossible happened. The great polar bear unity, for which we fought shoulder to shoulder with the divinely inspired clan Svartpels and their lords, has broken. And there is only one way that could have happened, Changeling infiltration..."

PLB_march_on_clan_anker:0 "Question of Clan Anker"
PLB_march_on_clan_anker_desc:0 "For one reason or another, Clan Anker, our ancient vassal and the closest clan to us culturally has been rather distant for some time. One would not think that they would betray us. But with the vile bugs seemingly everywhere, one can not be sure..."

PLB_push_south:0 "Begin Pushing South"
PLB_push_south_desc:0 "The clans of Wesslandia, lacking history, culture and honour, seem to be the one place where it seems the ideas of our, seemingly, former Clan Scyfling allies endured and worked as it’s inhabitants unified under a so called "Triple Alliance". Though perhaps, there is a different reason..."

PLB_make_clan_brodkorb_kneel:0 "Wesslandian Clans will Kneel"
PLB_make_clan_brodkorb_kneel_desc:0 "The Wesslandian clans might be numerous in both bears and griffon servants. And they might believe such numbers will grant them victory. But we remember, like always... We remember their strengths and their weaknesses from the last war. They will kneel against us again!"

PLB_grind_clan_brodkorb_into_dust:0 "Turn Wesslandia Into Dust"
PLB_grind_clan_brodkorb_into_dust_desc:0 "The newborn unity of Wesslandia and especially their strange newborn ambition is highly unbelievable in face of millennium of history. Perhaps they don’t even realize, but they had most likely been pushed into this direction by the Changelings.  And we cannot allow bears corrupted by such foreign influences to exist!"

PLB_wesslandia_in_our_claws:0 "Wesslandia is within our Claws"
PLB_wesslandia_in_our_claws_desc:0 "We marched through Wesslandia and the wast and populous land itself submitted to our will again, just like during the first unification war. Perhaps this is just the beginning, or perhaps the hardest struggle is already behind us? After all Wesslandians were neither great warriors, neither are they historians, yet those that stand against us should not be as weak."

PLB_cut_off_outcasts:0 "Cut off Roads From East"
PLB_cut_off_outcasts_desc:0 "The fact that Wesslandians simply left their borders for various criminals and lunatics and cultists to seep into the lands from which they were banished is just more proof that despite their arrogance they never should have been allowed to rule. And now we must fulfil our duty as a Great Clan and close down the eastern roads."

PLB_drive_scyfling_back:0 "Start Pushing West"
PLB_drive_scyfling_back_desc:0 "Onlatir is inhabited by some of the proudest and militantly capable clans of polar bears and they have historically been some of our most faithful allies, even if unification wars put us on separate sides. We had not forgotten such history, yet as we can see now as our forces clash again, they still haven’t learned to value history or symbols for that matter."

PLB_make_the_lords_kneel:0 "The Lords of Onlartir Must Kneel"
PLB_make_the_lords_kneel_desc:0 "If they do not wish to be our allies and brothers and sisters in arms they will kneel before us and admit not only that our will and steel is superior to theirs, but that the unity of bears is a goal far more noble than any rambles about surviving alone while surrounded by beasts far more dangerous."

PLB_the_only_lord_of_Onladir:0 "The Only Lord of Onlartir"
PLB_the_only_lord_of_Onlartir_desc:0 "The clans of Onlatir defy us and our goals. Furthermore they claim that a great force already protects them. They lie through their teeth claiming it’s Clan Scylfing, our allies and friends. Yet there is no such proof. The only conclusion therefore, is that this is yet further Changeling corruption!"

PLB_push_out_the_last_remnants:0 "Tighten Our Grip"
PLB_push_out_the_last_remnants_desc:0 "It’s perhaps a good omen that even if it’s clans were infiltrated and pushed into their worst impulses, the land of Onlatir remained firmly in bear claws. Had we taken any longer, it’s certain that Changelings would have ripped it out of our domains as they had done with so many other domains of our race. And now, we won’t give them such a chance."

PLB_the_harmonists:0 "The Challengers From the South"
PLB_the_harmonists_desc:0 "Clan Volsungr are our ancient rivals, yet ones which we have respected for all this history. It’s thus in great sadness we remember that they were nearly annihilated during the unification wars. They endured, however, yet are a perfect proof for why accepting exiles would only weaken a clan, corrupted as they are now with Equestrian weakness."

PLB_make_clan_volsungr_swear_loyalty:0 "Make Clan Volsungr Swear Loyalty"
PLB_make_clan_volsungr_swear_loyalty_desc:0 "Volsungr might be weak, corrupted by clear and open weakness of foreigners and obsessed with the most impossible and absurd ideas. Yet while they must submit to us, our of respect for what they once were, we will allow them to persist and endure. Perhaps with our show of force they will remember what they have lost?"

PLB_eradicate_clan_volsungr:0 "Break Clan Volsungr"
PLB_eradicate_clan_volsungr_desc:0 "It’s clear, Volsungr has not been corrupted by the acid that is changeling influence. However they are affected by a disease far worse - the so called "Harmony". An ideal that undermines the very basis of our society and chances at survival. Thus the perversion will be ended and Clan Volsungr will be remembered as one of proud warriors from now on."

PLB_harmonists_broken:0 "Rivals No More"
PLB_harmonists_broken_desc:0 "With this victory, the rivalry that has existed between clans of Volsungr and Svartpels for centuries and perhaps even millenia has been put to rest. From now on we won’t have to worry about an opposing army rising from Yak mountains in attempt to corrupt the rest of our race with their weakness."

PLB_capture_the_mountain_passes:0 "Secure The Mountain Passes"
PLB_capture_the_mountain_passes_desc:0 "Elders of Yak Mountains and Onlatir seemed to treat themselves as our equals or betters, yet again they seemed to ignore that the roads from both east and west into our lands were open, allowing for a surge of radicals, lunatics and those that would align themselves with the Changelings. Yet another mistake that is ours to fix."


PLB_clan_scyfling:0 "Our Brothers in Arms"
PLB_clan_scyfling_desc:0 "Clan Scyfling, our former, and we can only hope, current friends and greatest of allies.It is with them that we marched during the unification wars and now to their realm that the road lies open..."

PLB_make_the_subjugators_kneel:0 "Maybe Not All is Lost..."
PLB_make_the_subjugators_kneel_desc:0 "While the collapse of Clan Scyfling domain is unexpected and perhaps frightening, it’s also reassuring! It means our friends and comrades in arms fight and resist their brethren that have been turned to the side of Chrysalis like how we saw in Onlatir. We will march to help them and crush all those that rebel!"

PLB_crush_the_subjugators:0 "There is nothing left for us here..."
PLB_crush_the_subjugators_desc:0 "With lands of Scyfling tearing themselves we can only assume the worst, all of those that are our friends are gone, with only enemies and corrupt remaining. With sorrowful hearts we will have to clean this last domain of our gone friends and ensure they that are remembered as the heroes they were."

PLB_victory_over_subjugators:0 "Realm of Scyfling liberated!"
PLB_victory_over_subjugators_desc:0 "We have overcome the bloodshed that had overtaken the ancient domains of Clan Scyfling and have destroyed any and all those that oppose our most noble of goals. Though we can only hope such betrayals don’t happen again." 

PLB_triump_of_might:0 "Our Greatest Triumph"
PLB_triump_of_might_desc:0 "A difficult burden has now fallen to our shoulders. We have achieved victory against traitors and corruptive influences, yet now a far more difficult duty falls to us - the duty to govern and protect not just our own clan, but all bears within our lands."



PLB_scyfling_has_no_competence:0 "This is Insanity!"
PLB_scyfling_has_no_competence_desc:0 "We cannot tolerate such stupid and spiteful actions any longer! Clan Scyfling and Paw Wellington have proven again and again, that they do not desire to govern in true representation of all bears, rather merely desiring to turn everyone else into an extension of their own. Thus it falls to us to reforge the state they forged from blood into something better."

PLB_the_war_within:0 "The War Within"
PLB_the_war_within_desc:0 "Even if we desire to advance onwards and reunite the bears under a more proper, moral and harmonic goal, we must solve our inner issues at first, for it seems the older and younger generations have been divided by the opening the borders, sometimes through destruction of fortifications, that Paw Wellington has done as one of his last actions..."

PLB_a_new_generation:0 "A New Generation Emerges"
PLB_a_new_generation_desc:0 "Even if we must respect the elders, the younger generation is right. In both principle of friendship and more pragmatic needs for numbers, we should accept any and all bears that offer their help for us. Perhaps when the war is done we can create a better policy towards the countless exiles, but for now, the borders will be open."

PLB_wisdom_of_elders_prevails:0 "The Wisdom of the Elders Prevails"
PLB_wisdom_of_elders_prevails_desc:0 "The caution of the elders is right. There is a reason why even if our Princess and her friends were allowed back in, countless other’s were not. There are many exiles which were forced to leave not because of their arrogance or weakness, but rather for their crimes and insanity. We should not simply take anyone back in."

PLB_the_war_without:0 "The War Without"
PLB_the_war_without_desc:0 "We are united, willing and harmonious. Now the time has come to finally march outwards and reunite the polar bears under a far more moral, harmonic and proper manner. Let us hope harmony can persevere against both barbarity and blind fanaticism."

PLB_gaze_north:0 "Turn Our Gaze North"
PLB_gaze_north_desc:0 "It seems that perhaps the ideas of reasonable equality and friendship are not lost on the Wesslandians, for they have formed an alliance of their own in order to survive in this difficult period. Yet mayhaps we should be vary of their new-found unity too..."

PLB_extend_our_claws_to_benkestok:0 "Extend Our Claws to Wesslandia"
PLB_extend_our_claws_to_benkestok_desc:0 "The Wesslandians have always been the clan more touched by civilizations that, even if barely, fit more with harmonious ideas we ourselves aspire towards. Perhaps we could extend a claw of friendship towards them, showing them and perhaps everyone else, that we do not repeat the same mistakes as Scyfling."

PLB_swipe_our_claws_at_benkestok:0 "Swipe Our Claws at Wesslandia"
PLB_swipe_our_claws_at_benkestok_desc:0 "The "Triple Alliance" of Wesslandia very notably, and without any hiding towards that fact, desires nothing less than subjugation of every other bear clan beneath their claws. While we oppose unnecessary conflict, this is one of the countless cases where there is no other choice."

PLB_our_flags_over_wesslandia:0 "Our Flags Over Wesslandia"
PLB_our_flags_over_wesslandia_desc:0 "The Clans of Wesslandia have now understood why the bears need a harmonist system and the beautiful future we promise to them and now admit our authority. Our flags wave over their holds and the roads to north and west lays open. Now we will be able to bring the enlightenment of harmony to all that live in the "polar bear" lands."

PLB_reclaim_root_farms:0 "Reclaim Root Farms"
PLB_reclaim_root_farms_desc:0 "Wesslandian land is perfect in growing the few species of tubers that endure in the climate and that the whelps and other "lessers" within most bear clans subsist on. As chaos consumed the bear lands, we lost our access to the pseudo-farms where these were grown for a short span of time, with rather disastrous results. Tubers are not the preferred food of a bear, but they are enough to subsist for now."

PLB_secure_fish_roads:0 "Secure Fish Roads"
PLB_secure_fish_roads_desc:0 "While we can of course subsist on tubers and roots, a bear clan cannot endure for long without fish. Yet again our unfavourable position led to issues here. The routes were cut off, the farms aligned to us taken over. It took some time to re-establish these roads. Yet now we can feel like a proper clan again."

PLB_open_up_seal_hunting_grounds:0 "Open Up Seal Hunting Grounds"
PLB_open_up_seal_hunting_grounds_desc:0 "Seals, walrus, sea elephants and various other beasts of similar type are not exactly rare on the rocky coasts of the northern seas, yet they are considered something off limits for most. For after the creatures were nearly driven into extinction, consumption of such meat was only allowed for elders and most fearsome of warriors. Let’s spoil our veterans a bit."

PLB_domination_is_the_only_option:0 "Remember the Crimes of The "Uniters""
PLB_domination_is_the_only_option_desc:0 "While we cannot be attacked or besieged anymore, our troops too numerous and our land too wast to be overtaken by either Scyfling of Svartpels. But we cannot rest now even if some claim that it would be best to wait and properly prepare. No, we must remind our warriors and our citizens for why it’s so important that we unite bears as soon as possible!"

PLB_the_despot:0 "The Despot"
PLB_the_despot_desc:0 "Our views towards Paw Wellington and his clan of fanatics and bloodthirsty zealots is perhaps somewhat muddled. For while we cannot help but feel disgusted at many of their actions and spitefulness, would we even be here without them?"

PLB_scyfling_emmisarries:0 "Send Emmissaries to Clan Scyfling"
PLB_scyfling_emmisarries_desc:0 "Paw Wellington might be a despot, but he is not insane or even perhaps not as cruel as he pretends to be. After all, he spent much time among races far more pragmatic and less stubborn than most bears. Perhaps an attempt at negotiations could lead somewhere?"

PLB_the_principles_of_harmony_desc:0 "When the exiles first returned many years ago, they had their own idea for harmony. They had their principles and vision, one created from their beliefs and lives. But everybear has their own different vision of harmony, something that has become abundantly clear in the recent unification. And if we are to truly be one nation of clans, we must try to achieve all of them."

PLB_the_first_princess_of_polar_bears:0 "Crown the First Polar Princess"
PLB_the_first_princess_of_polar_bears_desc:0 "The polar bears have never been ruled by a monarch, instead lead by traditional clan leaders and warlords who are typically the strongest bear in the clan. This had changed after Eira had returned to Clan Volsungr, taking the title of Princess much like the alicorns to the south. She no longer leads just a clan though, but all bears, and her new title will reflect just that."

PLB_our_ideal_of_harmony:0 "Our Concept of Harmony"
PLB_our_ideal_of_harmony_desc:0 "Our idea of Harmony was the first of the clans, created from the far south of Equestria and molded to fit the society and culture of the polar bears.

PLB_paw_wellingtons_take_on_harmony:0 "Paw's Concept of Harmony"
PLB_paw_wellingtons_take_on_harmony_desc:0 "Paw Wellington's idea of Harmony is what some bears see as the natural connection between his old rule and the new principles we follow. Though his belief on the necessity of law and order has not changed, he is very skeptical of the bears ruling themselves and wishes for Princess Eira to take a more absolute role in leadership."

PLB_torbens_take_on_harmony:0 "Torben's Concept of Harmony"
PLB_torbens_take_on_harmony_desc:0 "Thunder Lord Torben's idea of Harmony is a very unique one, and one still rooted in Clan Svartpels' tradition. Though it has lost the lack of respect towards the weak, the ancient hierarchy of bears is still present based on strength. At the very least, many non-bears consider it very strange and orthodox."

PLB_the_pyramid:0 ""The Pyramid""
PLB_the_pyramid_desc:0 "The Pyramid is a recent unique ideology proposed by Torben and Clan Svartpels after recent Harmonist discussions and leanings. Though some hardliners of our own clan have called out its obvious continued use of the caste system, the inter-caste cooperation and protection of the lower castes is certainly intriguing."

PLB_the_svartpels_experiment:0 "The Svartpels Experiment"
PLB_the_svartpels_experiment_desc:0 "With the full consent of Princess Eira, Torben has begun implementing his idea of the Pyramid into Clan Svartpels and the surrounding state to test its effectiveness and viability. Though it may take time for the full effects of it to be seen, it has already created a surprising amount of cooperation and production from the region."

PLB_blessing_not_a_punishment:0 "A Blessing, Not a Punishment"
PLB_blessing_not_a_punishment_desc:0 "During the first unification wars, many bears of Clan Svartpels died in the battles against the other clans. This led to the region itself becoming depopulated, as those who did not return had their former fortresses of ice and stone decay into nothingness. However, many of them have now realized that this was a blessing, not a curse, as that land can be returned to nature as the strongest of the clan survive."

The freedom to choose your life is one of the most important ones a bear can have."

PLB_scyfling_experiment:0 "The Scyfling Experiment"
PLB_scyfling_experiment_desc:0 "Paw Wellington, the old despot of the polar bears has started laying down the foundations for his new ideas in Clan Scyfling with Princess Eira's approval.

PLB_the_great_equestrian_mistake_desc:0 "Equestria may be the oldest harmonic regime on the planet, a model for all others to look towards and see as the leader of Harmony itself. However, they made one crucial mistake in their history, and that was not protecting their environment and either controlling it or letting it be ravaged by industry. We will not make the same error."

PLB_no_hunting_zones:0 "Reuse Every Bit of Scrap"
PLB_no_hunting_zones_desc:0 "Very few things can't be used more than once.

With few natural resources at our disposal, making the absolute best of what we have will go a long way."

PLB_no_building_zones:0 "Spires of Shimmering Ice"
PLB_no_building_zones_desc:0 "Ice is a very versatile material, being able to be carved, sculpted, and if necessary, completely melted down. Polar bears already have a long history of making their fortresses out of ice, and it is time we use this to our advantage. By making many other of our buildings out of pure ice, we will easily be able to modify and repair them at a moment's notice, even if they may be more difficult to initally construct."

PLB_ensure_the_tundra_remains_untouched_desc:0 "Some areas of the Polar Bear lands, the taigas and tundras have been completely untouched by bears yet, and it should remain that way. By ensuring that nobear ever builds on that land, we can keep it in its natural, pristine state forevermore. Construction may suffer for a short while of course, but it is a sacrifice we are willing to make."

PLB_restoring_monster_populations:0 "Restoring Monster Populations"
PLB_restoring_monster_populations_desc:0 "An ecosystem is a very fragile thing. Even a single push or tip can send it spiraling out of control, broken beyond repair. It is why, even though some may consider it madness, that we must bring back our monster population in nature, restoring the natural balance to the forests and mountains. Though it may be expensive to undertake a project of this magnitude, it is ultimately worth it."

PLB_land_of_heroes_and_beasts:0 "Land of Heroes and Monsters"
PLB_land_of_heroes_and_beasts_desc:0 "The wild is an untamed, and sometimes dangerous place. Now, monsters freely roam the lands, vicious beasts that can defeat even a polar bear. And yet, the strongest of bears will always rise up to defeat them. For our nation has become much like legend, a land of heroes and monsters."

PLB_land_of_justice_and_law:0 "Land of Law and Justice"
PLB_land_of_justice_and_law_desc:0 "Order is one of the most important aspects of any nation. For when order fails, chaos takes reign, and that only leads to disaster and death.

polarbear.1.t:0 "The Yearly Review"
polarbear.1.d:0 "Chill spread through the air as Paw Wellington let out a heavy breath. He flipped over another page of the manuscript, looking through the somewhat amateurishly written runes and numbers. He missed the typed out text on easy to handle white or yellow paper he would read from during his exile in Griffonia. However even if it would take time to properly read through the report, the impressions from skimming through were not good. The progress was even slower than the previous year. Less reforms finished, not enough farms and manufactories finished and of course Key Lake plans unsuccessful like always... \n\n"Is everything to your liking, Elder?" the whelp that had delivered the report questioned. Paw had almost forgotten the lesser bear was there, as it waited for any kind of response.\n\n"Thank you for the concern, but everything is fine. You may go ho... You may retreat to your quarters." The whelp bowed it’s head and left the chamber, closing the whalebone door behind it.\n\nWellington laid down the leather manuscript on the iron table and stood up from a chair of bone and chitin. He approached the window of clearest ice and gazed into the welcoming blizzard outside.\n\nWhat was the mistake that he was committing, what was the failure? Why were there so many setbacks in his plan to turn the north into a proper state? When Grover of Griffons united his kin there was nothing like that. The Empire he forged in but less than a decade stood united and prospered. Of course Grover had earned the blessing of Boreas even before his great conquests... \n\nPaw scratched his chin."
polarbear.1.a:0 "Perhaps All-Father doesn’t find me worthy yet?"

polarbear.2.t:0 "Empty Cellars"
polarbear.2.d:0 "This shouldn’t have been a surprise. After all, modernizing an entire country was not something that would have been cheap or easy for any one clan. So much steel and coal was required for modernizing the production, so much gold was needed to buy griffon products which bears simply couldn’t produce yet.  A permanent process of modernization for almost half a decade should have been something to be proud of, considering it was all purely on the resources of a single clan...\n\nYet Paw didn’t feel pride. If anything he was angry, though not at his clan. After all, Clan Scyfling had done the best it could with resources available. No, he was mostly angry at himself. He shouldn’t have ignored how much loot there was left from the bear unification and not just assume it would last them a decade. And now they only had fish left to trade with the world. Iron was too important after all. Of course there was another possibility, something that the elders of other clans would most definitely react to with cub-like glee and sadistically exploit, but which was necessary."
polarbear.2.a:0 "Let’s hope I don’t have to break them again for this..."

polarbear.3.t:0 "The Clans Refuse to Provide Financial Support"
polarbear.3.d:0 ""You can leave now, thank you for bringing the news." Paw Wellington tried to sound as polite as possible as the whelp left the room. He might have been called "The Despot" or "The Tyrant" and if his old friends from Nova Griffonia saw him now they would definitely say the same, but he remembered that lesson in Aquilea, to control a large populace one needed to use both terror and kindness.\n\nOnly when the whalebone door closed and sealed the chamber shut did the paw of the Clan Scyfling Elder impact the table as Paw Wellington allowed his frozen rage to seep out. He knew the elders had received the requests, he knew they heard what was asked and required and he most certainly knew they had the resources to comply with the request. He had spies and informants among their ranks after all. Yet almost everyone, except the ever so dutiful Elder Torben of Clan Svartpels, claimed that their clans had fallen onto hard times or simply didn’t respond. It’s as if they took him for a fool! Had they forgotten what happened just half a decade ago? Did they want to go the way of Gullfodt? No, perhaps they simply didn’t understand the importance of such resources, especially when they were being asked and not forced… Maybe they felt this helps their rival clans? Perhaps they felt his hold would be weak with so many clans?"
polarbear.3.a:0 "All-Father willing we will show them wrong..."

polarbear.4.t:0 "The Greatest Betrayal "
polarbear.4.d:0 "Paw Wellington roared into the air, frozen air streaming outwards from his jaws. He tore through the manuscript on the table, scratching the steel table. This was absurd, outrageous and extremely uncharacteristic for the species. At first they displayed almost griffon like ability to reinterpret the orders and demands he had sent out. Then they, in a fashion more similar to changelings than any other species in just how disgusting it was, backstab and betray him in absurd acts of self destructiveness by destroying their own farms and fleets as if just to spite him! But nothing compared to this! To attack the panzerbjorn of one’s tyrant without a proper reasoning was breaking any and all laws! By the All Father this was a betrayal greater than what had killed entire clans! They would have to be punished, seven other clans have to be punished in some way. But when Paw thought about what sort of brutality would have to be invoked as a show of power in such a situation... No, he couldn’t do something like that... Perhaps he had gone soft or too weak, he assumed Torben would do it without thinking too much,  but contemplating such mass destruction, even in a state of such rage made him pause. There had to be some other way...\n\nPaw Wellington knelt beneath an ancient statue dedicated to the All Father. A creation of frozen stone, shaped into a strange, yet awe inspiring bear-like armoured beast, once marking the midpoint of a road between Clan Scyfling and the countless clans that used to exist on the western side of Key Lake. However now it was used as an indication of land where the rule of the Hive of Soryth began. Paw Wellington would travel to this monument monthly if he could, both to give his respects for the greatest of divinities and to visit the few fortresses remaining here that kept watch so that Chrysalis didn’t get any ideas. It would have been nice to visit other similar fortifications scatted across other empty borderlands across all of the Polar Bear owned North...\n\nA realization dawned for Paw Wellington. A show of power that other clans would be forced to respect. Something which could also be considered a true punishment for all their wrongdoings! He gazed up at the pseudo-ursine statue again."
polarbear.4.a:0 "Thank you All Father!"

polarbear.5.t:0 "No Honor for Them in War Like This"
polarbear.5.d:0 ""Has he gone truly mad?" The Grand Elder Ase of Clan Benkestok growled as one of her own spawn, though with the helmet it wore she couldn’t remember which, not that it mattered really at this point, continued describing the sort of absurd, unnecessary and even treasonous to the bear way of life "reforms" that "Paw Wellington" was trying to enforce through the use of the new "recruitment stations" staffed by the panzerbjorn of his own clan.\n\nFrom the very beginning she was sceptical of such dreams and ambitions of the despot, after all he seemed to be so aligned towards what griffons and changelings represented. It was disgusting to say the absolute least, for a polar bear to try to imitate species so minor and frail. It’s why she and lesser Elders agreed to simply ignore the request for resources for trade. It just stank of weakness of griffons and changelings. Though it seemed that Scyfling realized their mistake and now they were demanding, not asking. So at least there was something respectable there. And so Benkestok humoured the request. Only to find out this absurdity. The Scyfling were not organizing a force of attack or defense against any sort of attack! They were not even arming weaklings that don’t deserve it in the typical fashion for "Paw". No, they were in fact trying to forge an army loyal to one bear- "Wellington" himself! In betrayal to all duties of tyrant to lesser and lesser than tyrant, the bears of other clans were being forced to train to fight and die not for their clan, but for the despot!\n\nAs a clan that had put their axes down for Paw and whose leaders fell beneath his clans, Benkestok couldn’t just rebel, but as laws and duties were broken on all levels, Benkestok simply could choose not to listen to such orders.\n\nWhile Benkestok didn’t openly announce such defiance, word, rumour and news travelled by themselves, and soon most other clans had joined in to simply refuse to send the bears of their clan to serve in the armies organized by Paw. In fact, many seemed to feel so insulted that they stopped patrolling the western borders with the Changelings, something that was previously done willingly, forcing Paw Wellington and Clan Scyfling to compensate with bodies of their own."
polarbear.5.a:0 "...."

polarbear.6.t:0 "Let the Waters Burn"
polarbear.6.d:0 "Fritjof knew they would would be exiled into the wastes of Nova Griffonia where they would perhaps fall prey to cannibals or radicals over this. He was no bear, couldn’t even compare in mass or combat prowess and thus stood no chance in a duel. He was but a griffon after all, born of servants, and even when given a place at the table of the warriors for being an exception among his kind, he was still not on par, neither in power, nor perception by others and those above. However this also meant that if an "owlbear" committed a betrayal of such proportions it would not be blamed onto the clan, but rather the accusations and retribution would fall purely onto his warband, for most bears still believed that even uplifted griffons couldn’t truly persist and understand the nobility, brotherhood and honour of the clan system.\n\nIt wasn’t fair of course, it wasn’t just in any true way. It was perhaps even absurd that he was sacrificing the future of his own and others like him who managed to carve their way up from mere servants into warriors. But as the Falsen fleet burned in the distance and the plans of the Despot of exerting more control over the Wesslandian clans was shattered, Fritjof couldn’t help but grin."
polarbear.6.a:0 "My life for the power of the clan!"

polarbear.7.t:0 "Beneth the Mountains"
polarbear.7.d:0 "Eira, the Princess of Clan Volsungr, surveyed the "scribes" of Clan Scyfling that had presented themselves for her. Apparently Paw Wellington had sent out the closest his clan had to scientists to "teach" other clans the advancements he had brought back from his travels in Griffonia and learn whatever science and magic that other clans had created. She couldn’t help but notice a rather patronizing tone with the request, especially humorous as the despot referred to his own "scientist" equivalents, something rather outdated and medieval sounding.\n\nThough it didn’t matter how Paw Wellington had framed this request, or well, more order if anything, she knew that it was just another way to attempt controlling and stifling other clans, instead of actually trying to understand or care why everyone except Svartpels didn’t consider him a proper tyrant. Clan Volsungr had to comply of course, even if she was more Equestrian than Polar in character after her exile, Eira still understood and respected the laws of her homeland. But she also understood intricacies of modern politics. She just hoped that the elders of other clans were smart or cunning enough to see the easily exploitable mistakes in how Paw Wellington had worded his order....\n\nAs the "scribes" were guided out of the hall to be led to the chambers within the great Volsungr mountain fortress where they could rest, Eira turned to one of her former exile bodyguards and murmured."
polarbear.7.a:0 "Keep them occupied with pointless knick knacks as long as we can."

polarbear.8.t:0 "The Question of Outcasts"
polarbear.8.d:0 "Of course, even if we are starting to take in outcasts in substantial numbers in an attempt to undermine the power of our subordinate clans, we still have to decide how far we go. After all, if a bear is exiled out of any lands inhabited by his kinds, instead of simply his own clan, then they must be quite the radical and in some cases even transgressors against all laws mortal and spiritual. Perhaps many of them had reformed in exile, perhaps they have dropped their absurd and amoral ideas that they fought and fell for. However we can never be sure, especially considering how long polar bears can hold down on their ideals, even during the darkest days of exile. Paw Wellington knew of course, being one of such dishonored and radical exiles who was banished who kept up his ideals of modernization and adaptation of griffon like methods for decades.\n\n\However even if we are doing this in what is a clear insult and attempt to show power over other clans, it would perhaps be wise to not anger them too much. Perhaps limiting ourselves to the least dangerous groups would show both our power and dominance when it comes to where it matters to the other clans while also not causing too much outrage. Of course, we can simply accept everyone back and hope that when conflict arises we have enough new recruits that we are simply numerous enough so that no other clan thinks they can win. Of course taking the more radical option could lead to losing our only current and firm ally, Lord Torben of Clan Svartpels..."
polarbear.8.a:0 "Let’s limit ourselves to the most reasonable."
polarbear.8.b:0 "All bears are welcome back."

polarbear.9.t:0 "Stupidity"
polarbear.9.d:0 "The news spread like lightning of course, even for an untamed land without proper roads and communication, as was the intent. Across the polar bear inhabited lands clans reacted in absolute disbelief as they learned of what had happened... And they rose in revolt. Paw Wellington had been testing their patience for very long and now it was a perfect chance.\n\nIn a giant fortress beneath the great mountains that stretched across lands of yaks and bears and even griffons, the princess of Clan Volsungr started marshalling her forces to save her kind from this idiot despot and perhaps show her kind a better way than this.\n\nNear the most northern shores, where even the hardiest of beasts couldn’t endure the brutal winds, a lord of lightning and thunder took the news, of both the new order and disbelief. His friend could never order something like this, could he? No... It must have been an interference from none other than the accursed Changelings! Yes... They must have manufactured this to invade! And thus the lord of thunder too raised his forces, depleted as his clan was from years of war.\n\nAnd of course, the Despot himself, left with no other options due to his own rash actions, prepared his armies for another march of unification."
polarbear.9.a:0 "I can still prove I am worthy!"
polarbear.9.b:0 "I can still save us all!"
polarbear.9.c:0 "I can still save our freedom!"

polarbear.11.t:0 "Insanity"
polarbear.11.d:0 "The news spread like lightning of course, even for an untamed land without proper roads and communication, as was the intent. Across the polar bear inhabited lands clans reacted in absolute disbelief as they learned of what had happened... And they rose in revolt. Paw Wellington had been testing their patience for very long, but this was pure insanity which should have never been allowed in the first place!\n\nIn a giant fortress beneath the great mountains that stretched across lands of yaks and bears and even griffons, the princess of Clan Volsungr started marshalling her forces to save her kind from this mad tyrant and prevent the nightmare that would rise from this.\n\nNear the most northern shores, where even the hardiest of beasts couldn’t endure the brutal winds, a lord of lightning and thunder took the news of the new order in disbelief. His friend could never be that mad, could he? No... It smelled of a conspiracy and something foul and disgusting... It smelled of bugs... No other creatures could have manufactured something so insulting yet destructive! They must done this because they are afraid! They must have known what awaited their wretched kind if the North was truly united! But they would not be allowed to win! And thus the Lord of Thunder too raised his forces, depleted as his clan was from years of war.\n\nAnd of course, the Despot himself, realizing now that he had ruined his dream, that he would now have to put down every clan, armoured himself with grim determination and an idea of salvation and marshalled his forces."

polarbear.11.c:0 "I must save them from madness!"

scyfling.1.t:0 "We Will not Yield!"
scyfling.1.d:0 "Such chaos… Such devastation…\n\nYet again had bears tearing into each other in open war, even worse than before... Paw Wellington had annulled all duties, alliances and tyrant-subjugated connections between any and all clans. It was surprising to know that all clans had complied to the demand. However the horror unleashed by this untamed, wild war had tore at his very being. It was a result of all what he had done. All of his mistakes... In front of his clan he continued looking stern and strong as they gathered for war. But on the holy grounds he felt so weak, so confused...\n\nWhat had he done wrong? He tried to mimic the great  Emperor’s Grover I and II, sometimes also tapping into the successes of liberator Alexander Kamerskai. Have these been wrong inspirations? Had he not noticed something integral...\n\nPerhaps he should have taken Torben seriously back then, when the lord of Thunder joked that he has become too griffonized for his own good, too ignorant of clan systems and too adamant in his ideas of superiority he needs allies not subjects... Perhaps that might have saved him  then. But now... Now...  Now it seemed that there was only war..."
scyfling.1.a:0 "And what do I do now?"

scyfling.3.t:0 "Minor Clans of the South"
scyfling.3.d:0 "For as long as the oldest scriptures of both bear and foreign origins have recorded, our race has always been one of warriors and warmongers. We waged war on each other and on yaks and when changelings and griffons pushed into our frozen realm we fought them too. Some even say that we have waged war on the land itself as we had to fight both the climate and the beasts before we tamed even our very homeland. Our very society has been defined by this struggle. Every leader, every influential figure, even the greatest and most revolutionary smiths and scribes have been great fighters for only through combat can one show the strength of their ideas to their betters.\n\nYet even among a society that glorifies war so much, the three clans of Onlatir are considered above and beyond when it came to militarism. For it was them who stood for centuries as a wall against rogue Yak Khans and Changeling hordes, all while continuing a seemingly eternal conflict between each other. It had perhaps been a good thing that the land was as desolate and unfitting to sustain life as it came, for had Onlatir clans not been the least numerous ones, for if they were, one of them would certainly overran the north far before Paw Wellington had returned from exile. Though even with their lacking numbers, the subjugation of Onlatir clans was the most difficult of campaigns during the first unification and took the entire might of both clans Scyfling and Svartpels. Something which would be impossible to repeat now."

Instead of waiting for an onslaught from superior numbers, clan Kane had chosen to raise their forces and strike first. And thus two armies met on a frozen field…\n\nPerhaps such a meeting place was the best for the sort of negotiations that happened between Paw Wellington and Grand Elder Ase. For what better place for two warlords, one potentially on rise and another on seeming decline, than on the field of what could soon be a battle?\n\nPerhaps, in disappointment  to some, the battle wouldn’t manifest, for an agreement would be reached. Though in a true bear fashion, quite a few red puddles would soon appear on the light blue ice and several of the "diplomats" were forced to leave due to broken or even shattered bones as the more difficult disagreements were solved by duels till near death. Even Paw Wellington himself was forced to take on several Kane elders to truly prove the necessity of a proper and united polar bear army, though he couldn’t fully show his own competence as Ase of Kane wrestled him to a standstill.\n\nThe final solution was perhaps not the most satisfactory for either group, but Onlatir forces would fight for clan Scyfling, as long as Paw Wellington upheld his duties as a proper tyrant, allowed them to be led by their own warlords in battle, and took several panzerbjorn as military advisers."

It was not the sort of silent egoistic pride of how griffons would act and of course not the almost absurdly cublike and comedic arrogance of ponies. Both of those were tolerable. Yet when it came to bears, it was almost always a feeling of predatory superiority. A bear that smugly grins at you sees not a defeated adversary or sub-par acquaintance, they see defeated prey, even if it was merely a moral or psychological victory. And with such a mentality spread out among the Gotlung panzerbjorn and perhaps elders, for some time it seemed negotiations would fail.\n\nThe final agreement was far more beneficial towards Paw Wellington and Clan Scyfling than they would have assumed from what in an other case would be an admit of defeat. Yet perhaps the way Kane situation unfolded had convinced the Elder Council of Gotlung to rethink their previous position. The agreement was rather simple if anything. A simple tyrant-subject relationship with one simple demand - that being that the elders or potential leader of Clan Gotlung, if one would rise to such rank ever again, would be allowed to partake in creation and enactment of new law in order for their autonomy and traditions to be protected."

Yet it was from the top of the tallest mountain in Onlatir that the shaman lord of Rozenkrantz gazed upon the untamed power within the heavens …\n\nThe sight at the peak of the mountain was surprising to say the least. The Shaman Lord of Rozenkrantz, one who had abandoned their name and existence before achieving such position was sitting on a throne of ice and bone almost unprotected, with barely half a dozen others of it’s order and just a tiny group of panzerbjorn as guard. It would have been absurd to assume that’s this was everything, yet it was hard to imagine where else any other bears would have hidden on such an unforgiving terrain. It was of course an attempt to create a sense of power. To potentially intimidate an opponent with the implication that they could be taken down with nothing more than a small warband. Yet while it was somewhat impressive, it couldn’t exactly compare to power plays one would see in Griffonia…\n\nPaw Wellington had expected a bit more of defiance, aggression, even absurd demands under threats of unseen forces perhaps, yet the Shaman Lord had been mostly… compliant and agreeable. Perhaps this had been because Clan Rozenkrantz had gazed into the winter lights and seen futures where Scyfling had come to crush them and and assumed this was an attempt to demand subservience? Whatever was the case, the final agreement was reached relatively soon. The duties of tyrant and subject were reiterated to be remembered in front of winter lights so that the divine could hear them this time and punish the transgressors if one side would break the deal, something that Paw Wellington was not the most enthusiastic about yet still performed the deed. The only thing demanded beyond the traditional duties was that shamans of Rozenkrantz would accompany Paw Wellington during his campaign and rule as both assistants and observers.

And thus two armies met on a frozen field…\n\nPerhaps, had the armies of Clan Scyfling been led by any other Elder, they would have most likely lost if they tried to fight Clan Kane in anything approaching a traditional manner. They were the more numerous force of course, nearly outnumbering the enemy three to one. It was understandable, a single minor clan could never raise enough troops to match a Greater Clan of course. Yet as always, the ursines of Onlatir were more than large and strong enough, that had they cut through the distance, lines would shatter and victory would be theirs. It was an ancient  strategy, simple, and for the longest time, difficult to counter, even if Kane lacked heavy support. However , such a tactic required ground that could be charged through. And thus, in what was a rather dishonourable and sordid action, the land between armies was bombarded by artillery and explosives, making the ground simply impossible to charge through, trapping them in a defensive position which was charged by the more numerous Scyfling forces. Yet had Paw Wellington not subdued Grand Elder Ase of Clan Kane and forced her to surrender in the middle of the brawl into which the battle had devolved, the victory had been bloody and potentially not even belong to Clan Scyfling.\n\nHowever even in defeat, Kane refused to put down their axes and bow, for they claimed Paw Wellington fought them without honour and showed the same disrespect for tradition he had shown before in countless other situations. It seemed as if Kane would only break if a true bloodbath ensued. Yet it didn’t take that, for instead of ordering another assault, Paw Wellington merely invited the clan Kane Elders to a  "weapon demonstration ". Whatever the weapon was shown to them, the demonstration ended with a tyrant-subject agreement. Though this time both sides were truly chained with duties."

Their new fortress was impressive to say the absolute least, something that Paw Wellington couldn’t deny even while he and his best panzerbjorn were tearing through the corridors and halls within the allegedly impenetrable fort, yet it was built for heavily outdated ways of war, not accounting for modern artillery and explosives, which just like the first time, punched holes through it’s great walls.And yet still, despite being outnumbered and their walls were broken through, Gotlung fought tooth and nail, often literally, for every corridor and anything resembling a a defensible position.\n\nOf course, eventually the elder council and their troops stepped down, surrendering against superior forces and abilities of the despot whose chains they thought they had thrown away. However this time Paw Wellington had promised, in front of everyone of Clan Gotlung and Clan Scyfling, that this time the traditions and autonomy of Gotlung would be respected so that a war like this would not repeat."

For at every turn and every step of the march to the top of the mountain they were harassed and engaged by panzerbjorn and shamans. By themselves these small groups would cause no danger in anything resembling proper battle. Yet they would engage the advancing Scyfling column from the sides, attacking through what had to be some sort of magical coverage of wind and snow, slaying or at least tying up dozens of warriors before retreating into seemingly the mountain itself. Sometimes entire streams of snow and ice would appear, cutting off advancement for tens if not hundreds of bears, who were now forced to dig through as they were engaged by enemy. The only solitude was in the fact that even in something approaching hit and run tactics Rozenkrantz warriors refused to merely strike and retreat. Instead they would stay and fight until they themselves were wounded or felled or such a fate happened to a Scyfling bear. Though more often than not it was the Scyfling bears that fell. And yet the column kept advancing higher and higher, Paw Wellington leading from the front, inspiring his increasingly exhausted forces.\n\nThe battle of the peak would be a far smaller engagement than one could expect for an engagement for the future of an entire clan as barely a hundred bears, almost evenly split between the clans tore at each other. Initially the shaman clan seemed to be the ones that would come out on top, yet they had no reserves and their troops were tied up on the mountain itself, while Clan Scyfling warriors, if slowly, were seeping into the battle in greater and greater numbers. Eventually this had become too much and the Shaman Lord had to lay down his axe and surrender, followed by his clan.\n\nThe renewal of oaths would have been almost a mirror of the last time, and had it indeed been the same, the bitterness of both defeats would perhaps continue to fester, had it not been for the fact that this time the battle was fought and oaths were given under the Winter Light’s."

After all, Clan Kane was famous or even infamous for the size and strength of their  warriors. Had this been a traditional engagement, Clan Kane would have charged into their enemies seeking to overwhelm their enemy through sheer force of what could be likened to an avalanche of angry armoured beasts, all while said enemy would be bombarded with either cannons or the closest thing to machine guns that was available.Something which in this engagement the Kane force was lacking. If one subscribed to the traditional bear sense of honour,  Clan Scyfling would not use their own heavy weapons.  Yet it has been decided by Paw Wellington, that this would not be allowed to be a traditional engagement. This was not part of a war... It was part of an extermination. And for this duty, something never before seen or even imagined for most bears, and most likely not widely seen even among Changelings and Griffons - "hunting rifles" meant to take down dragons. Barely a dozen of such weapons were available to Clan Scyfling, yet they were the turning point. The very first volley tore through the Clan Kane avalanche, which was then hit by artillery. After that it was a slaughter...\n\nWith their greatest warriors and even their elders gone, slain perhaps quite unfairly in battle, the fortresses didn’t hold for long either. They were rather quickly turned into nothing more than butcheries. Only some of whelps or cubs were spared, for they were too young or too... lacking in intelligence and physical might to cause any danger or hold any grudge.\n\nAnd such was the end of clan Kane."

Clan Gotlung had thought they made an unbreakable fortress, yet they had done nothing more than prepare themselves a mass grave...\n\nArtillery, explosives, the few dozen anti-dragon rifles and even several improvised flame-throwers, all unleashed their fury on the walls of what any other bear force would have seen as the greatest of modern fortresses.

scyfling.34.d:0 "Wesslandia has always been the region of polar bear lands which is the most strange and wondrous for the bears, yet perhaps the most normal for most creatures that do not thrive in winter and cold. It’s forests are plentiful of both berries and game and stretch on seemingly forever. The game itself is rather more similar to what one would see in "normal" forests of Northern Griffonia or even Severnaya instead of the strange half magical beasts that roam most of the land. Even the land itself is incredibly fertile, bearing tubers and plenty other mostly edible, if bland and long growing, arctic plants. Even the Northmost sea seems to be more plentiful in fish and seal near the region.Yet despite all of this, no great clan or great warlord arose from this land as clans, instead of growing to eclipse all others would shatter over access to best fishing or farming spots. Even in face of potential conquest and annihilation at the hands of Nova Griffonian expeditions the clans didn’t unify, merely reclaiming huge chunks of land where griffons had begun to settle as their masters in the west were simply unable to administer it properly  and turning the would be conquerors into nothing more than servants for ursine overlords.\n\nCurrently the land is occupied by three clans - Falsen, Benkestok and Brodkorb, all of which are merely a few decades old as they were merely the result of yet another cycle of a clan growing in power until it shatters. Though this time it seems it took longer for unique traditions to develop as the three clans all use griffon servants and primarily share traditions, with the exception of Falsen, whose members seem to be fascinated with sea and shipbuilding . Perhaps it’s these reasons for why the leaders of these clans managed to so easily agree between themselves to forge an alleged alliance of equals, something that has never been seen before among bears. Similarly worrying are claims that this "Triple Alliance" desires to usurp power over the bears themselves."

Apparently the three leaders of the alliance decided that such a point, located in the closest to  "historically neutral territory " would be most fitting. That by itself was a worrying sign as they didn’t attempt to amaze Clan Scyfling with some great show of force or brutal implications, rather throwing an indirect insult and implication that Paw Wellington never controlled Wesslandia and it’s lords. An attempt at insult and undermining authority far more similar to court jabs of Vedina than anything most bears would do. A worrying development, yet Paw Wellington had spent time within said noble courts and would not be undermined by a pale imitation.\n\nNonetheless negotiations took quite some time, and despite the attempt of appearing more civilized and reminiscent of more  "advanced " clans in a seeming misunderstanding of Paw Wellington’s intentions, the negotiations did result in a substantial amount of spilled blood and broken bones, with even Paw Wellington getting a few broken ribs. Yet a final and decisive agreement was reached. Surprisingly enough, despite the claims of grandeur and even seeming desire to rule over the entirety of ursine kind, the "Triple Alliance" didn’t posses much when it came to actual ideas of what sort of domain was desired, beyond some basic concepts for an economic and agricultural policy out of all things. Perhaps they had simply not prepared to go that far. Though there was always the alternative that being besieged on several fronts which they most certainly were, prevented any solid plans to be drawn out. Whatever was the case, the three lords agreed to be integrated back into Paw Wellington’s domain as long as their word on what is done with the griffon servant caste is final."

Yet this campaign was not a lightning fast march through seemingly barely resisting land. Yet this time it was a slow and brutal grind with not enough heavy weapon support and most combat devolving into melee brawls . Whatever artillery or heavy equipment that there was in the Scyfling army, was not enough for an engagement that large as it stretched in pockets from the very sea to the mountains that designated the border between polar bears and yaks.\n\nYet victory was achieved by Paw Wellington, eventually, and not through a method which any clan would consider honourable or even remotely traditional. For it was by using weapons which were kept only for cases where extermination was the only true option - "anti-dragon rifles” of Nova Griffonian production. Only a few dozen of such weapons were available to Clan Scyfling and they were deemed to not be suitable for engaging foreign enemies due to clunkiness, slow rate of fire and even issues properly aiming such weapons. Yet against the stubbornness of traditional Panzerbjorn tactics? It was perfect to say the absolute least. And thus it was deployed a tiny part of the "Triple Alliance" frontline, obliterating several warbands. With such application of localized destruction, the Wesslandian clans were left reeling, their line shattered without any seeming potential reserves. A repeat of the last pacification followed as the lords were forced to lay down their weapons in front of Paw Wellington and admit their status as subjects. One could only hope that this time Clan Scyfling could build up proper connections, for if Wesslandia rebelled once again, there was no telling if victory was possible."

Yet for all their numbers of bears and all potential forces raised from the griffon servant caste, they lacked the technological and strategic edge and were not allowed to realize that this was not a typical bear conflict of tradition, honour and melee prowess, rather it was a war of extermination. And thus they were not and simply could not be ready for the weapons that were deployed against them . Their armour and barricades stood no chance against rifles, if weapons of such scale could even be called that, meant to slay dragons. The griffon auxiliaries, even if they had grown to be able to sustain the great colds of polar bear lands still lacked the natural cold of their masters and feathers and furs they were clad in caught fire rather easily even when rather primitive flamethrowers were deployed against them.\n\nAfter the front was cleansed it came time for the countless fortresses and other various locations that belonged to the clans which were now left woefully lacking in any possible defences. The purges of the "Triple Alliance" forts were even more pitiful than the slaughter at the front lines and even caused some of Scyfling to question the righteousness of the cause and actions of Paw Wellington. Of course none of them dared to disobey or challenge the Despot or his best warriors to a duel.\n\nThe final remnants of the Wesslandian clans at the fronts with Clan Scyfling and Clan Svartpels lasted the longest, yet surrounded on all sides and their homes destroyed they didn’t stand a chance."

This was in no small part due to the fact that the clan didn’t have any tradition of armoured warriors and they seemed to have never used the traditional large axes, the weapon that any proper polar bear warrior would carry as their primary armament until the last few decades. Rather their greatest warriors were so called "Nanooks", hunters that preyed on the magical beasts that filled the mountain ranges. Furthermore instead of dwelling within fortresses of stone and ice forged in unforgiving wastes, Volsungr would hide within the depths of the mountains as if surrendering to the elements in a manner more fitting for Diamond Dogs than any proper ursines. Yet there were two reasons for why, despite all the rumours and behaviour, nobody dared to challenge Volsungr’s right to exist. Firstly, despite not using the traditional polar bear weapons, the clan possessed several entire halls of starsteel armour and weapons within their unbreakable mountain home. Secondly, Clan Volsungr had a long history of both friendship and ritualized wars with the Yak clans south of ursine lands. As Yaks were one of the few species which polar bears respected and thought as close to themselves in spirit, a friendship with their clans were a clear indication of being proper bears to many. Only the history obsessed Clan Svartpels denied such notions and waged many a war against Volsungr, though mostly without any success.\n\nThat changed during the first bear unification as an alliance of Scyfling and Svartpels brutalized the clan and some even grew to believe this would lead to it’s extinction. Yet it endured, by using a method which others would consider too much, accepting back countless exiles without having to withstand a trial by combat. Even their current leader, the so called  "princess" Eira, was a former exile who during her exile travelled through Equestria and copied many of their ways. This has put both her and Clan Volsungr in opposition to us politically before even if they never showed it in the open and mostly seemed to ignore us, and now they march against us in war again."

Yet compared to all the meetings with the strange Vedinian cults and corrupt nobles, arrogant would be warlords and bandits within what once they said to be was a duchy yet was now under Alexander Kamerskai and even working for the  "Talons" in the griffon colonies, this was the strangest. It wasn’t intimidating or conventionally scary. Rather the opposite. Instead of acting like mad beasts, trying to threaten or scare him or even openly mock him or call him nothing more than a beast, Clan Volsungr was nice. Absurdly nice even. The meeting occurred in a room within one of the fortresses of the clan. Furnished as if it was a minor palace within Equestria, Paw Wellington could only assume. The Volsungr bears apologized... Actually apologized that their "princess" was being late. Furthermore they had offered various refreshments and nourishment. And such atmosphere was definitely far more terrifying than any attempts at threats by weaker creatures that he had experienced. For what sort of figure was this Eira, that she whipped a clan of mountain monster hunters into such submission?\n\nEira of Clan Volsungr was a rather strange figure. She was dressed in gold and red, with a substantial amount of jewellery and embroidery. Something which any proper bear would associated with weakness. After all gold was a metal from which no weapon could be made and most fabrics were too weak to protect a warrior from enemy blows. Yet the princess of Clan Volsungr was most definitely not weak physically, nearly being as large as Paw Wellington himself. Furthermore while she seemed to attempt to appear nice and welcoming, there was still frost and steel behind that façade.\n\nThe negotiations themselves were similar, very fluffy and nice looking from an outsiders perspective as Paw Wellington attempted to create a similar mask. However, with how misaligned the ideologies of the clans were, especially at the current point in time. And yet an agreement was reached, even if it was overwhelmingly vague and included countless various exceptions or situational duties and obligations as both former exiles tried to outmanoeuvre each other and ensure the best situation no matter what happened after. One thing was sure however, even if it went the worst way after this, Clan Scyfling would still be the leader and Volsungr the subordinate."

That the forces under Paw Wellington would posses either technologically superior equipment or at least wouldn’t posses them in good enough numbers. This didn’t seem to be the case for Volsungr, which seemed to posses weapons similarly advanced and even something superior. Their armoured self propelled sleds were especially powerful weapons, being impossible to penetrate by most with most weapons. Only concentrated artillery or heavy anti-dragon rifles could shatter the advances of these weapons. And Volsungr seemed to posses something that could match these weapons in range and power too. For the first time in almost a decade, the position of power was somewhat flipped.\n\nAnd yet despite technological superiority, most of the weapons under the possession of Volsungr were rather limited in availability. The Clan itself was also lacking in numbers compared to the forces amassed by Paw Wellington to this point. And thus, even if it was slow and many of the more advanced and exotic contraptions had to be taken down with numbers, and Volsungr was pushed into a defensive position.\n\nEventually any and all fortresses and outposts outside of the main Volungr hold were broken and shattered, the offensive weapons becoming more of a liability than an advantage.  Of course, storming the mountains themselves and trying to engage the Volsungr within the caves and underground in which they thrived  would have been suicidal. Yet, while the fortress itself was impossible to take for any force that wasn’t absolutely overwhelming, in this case it didn’t matter if the fortress was actually taken. It only mattered that Volsungr would fall. And thus any and all entrances were bombed until they collapsed inward. The Clan would perish in the holes they dug out themselves."

For it was one of the most intellectual and scientifically aligned clans, at least before the Volsungr started welcoming outcasts back en masse, yet also one of the most warlike and reactionary when it came to advancements. The ritual of induction into the ranks of it’s panzerbjorn and leadership was the most brutal, as it included not just slaying beasts or winning a trial by combat, but as a proof of strength one was supposed to be struck by lightning and endure, yet the same induction ceremony questioned the would be warriors or leaders knowledge of bear history, tradition and what amounted to traditional sciences and crafts. Clan Svartpels was also heavily opposed to many ideas on change and advancement suggested by the younger generations, being the main source of bears cast out of the frozen north, yet when the proposer of such changes had proven their worth in combat, they would willingly and happily follow the changes. Such was the case when Paw Wellington managed to earn their friendship through a duel by defeating their leader, the great Thunder Lord Torben. After this Clan Svartpels assisted us in the unification of polar bear lands. Their support continued even through our most controversial and in retrospective absurd decisions. And yet now they stand against us.\n\nYet it’s not for reasons one would think. For Clan Svartpels and Torben turned against us not because they believe that we have broken our duties or committed some great sin. It seems that for one reason or the other, Torben and his entire clan believes that these actions were not of Paw Wellington and his clan, rather it’s either a changeling conspiracy of spreading lies or misinformation and shattering bear unity and causing conflict. In fact, they are so adamant in this belief that any bear that even wishes to approach a member of the clan is forged to engage in a duel as it’s widely believed that even if Changelings are able to masquerade of something comparing to our size, such form is not possible to maintain in combat."
scyfling.62.a:0 "That might be quite an issue. "


scyfling.68.t:0 "Battle of Ice"
scyfling.68.d:0 "Despite all the conflict and war that it took to get to this point, the engagements with clan Svartpels were perhaps the most worrying of campaigns that Paw Wellington had to plan for. After all it was the only clan which wasn’t subjugated through war. Rather, their allegiance in the bear unification wars were changed through but half a dozen duels as Paw Wellington fought and defeated Torben and the best panzerbjorn of the clan. Yet such a strategy wouldn’t be acceptable now. After all, anything that wasn’t a traditional battle could easily be perceived as trickery or actions of a collaborator. Ant thus Scyfling would have to fight far more skilled and physically capable Svartpels warriors with nothing more than mere axes.\n\nThe Scyfling warbands easily outnumbered their Svartpels counterparts, however as the battle continued unfolding, it was very clear that numbers didn’t matter in a battle like this. Only when Paw Wellington and Torben met in the middle of the great engagement and the Thunder Lord was defeated by the Despot did the battle turn to the side of Scyfling and it was less an actual turn and more Torben rising to his feet with a great jolly laugh and screaming out the words of surrender as the entirety of the engagement and this duel was apparently good enough.\n\nThe battle was followed by a great feast as the ties of friendship and allegiance were reforged through exchange of foods and alcohol. Torben was of course overjoyed that Clan Scyfling and Paw Wellington had survived what he claimed must have been a changeling infiltration and spread of lies about the idea that Paw Wellington had accepted back the Mechanites and perhaps even worst scum. And that of course, with the two clans together again, something like this would not happen ever again."
scyfling.68.a:0 "Let’s just not tell them our initial ideas..."


scyfling.73.t:0 "Thunder Will Never Be Heard Again"
scyfling.73.d:0 "This was perhaps the hardest of things that Paw Wellington had done before. Perhaps not in a literal sense, as while Clan Svartpels were indeed fearsome opponents, with our mind sets to destruction this war was not contested or ever even seemed to be turning towards the lords of thunder. What was hard, as for many, including bears, was having to destroy your friends and long time allies due to conflict over your own actions. Actions that you can’t take back and actions that they simply won’t accept. Yet it had to be done for a greater future, for a greater chance of polar bear survival as a state. And thus even if it was painful, it had to be done. And thus Scyfling deployed against Svartpels in full force.\n\nScyfling had technological, numerical and strategic superiority, but this didn’t mean that the lords of thunder went down quietly. They fought and bled and perished, yet crushed many a warband, often in spite of ranged weaponry which would have crushed any other force. And yet despite such victories, they couldn’t replace their losses, for there were so few true Svartpels yet there were many bears under Paw Wellington. And eventually, despite how much they raged and fought, their fortresses were crushed, their warriors and elders hunted down and whoever remained were pushed into the sea."
scyfling.73.a:0 "Only blizzard rules in the north now…"



volsungr.1.t:0 "To Bring Harmony!"
volsungr.1.d:0 "Chaos. Fighting. Death. The clans once again at outright war with each other. It was the product of the failure and incompetence of both Paw Wellington and Clan Scyfling, who sought to lead and control the clans instead of governing in the name of all bears. It is clear that a new path, new leadership is the only way to save the clans from themselves and find new unity. Clan Volsungr, and Princess Eira would take charge, head the course and bring the principles of harmony and morality to these lands.\n\nIt will not be easy, that much is for certain. The other clans will not accept harmony or our leadership easily. But through words or claws, the polar bears will be united once again, and this time there will be no despot to lead us astray."
volsungr.1.a:0 "For the cause of all bears!"

volsungr.2.t:0 "The Internal Debate"
volsungr.2.d:0 "While the other clans continue to clash in the frozen north, a serious issue has developed in Clan Volsungr itself. For while he no longer holds control over the polar bears, his last action of opening the borders to the former exiles has caused heated debate and conflict between the elders and young ones in the clan. It is clear that if we are to march and unite the bears once more, Princess Eira must take a side and solve this issue before it spirals out of control.\n\nOn one paw, the younger bears want the clan to accept all bears who are returning to the land. Their numbers will be necessary to subdue the other clans, they say, and thus any aid offered should be taken. In the spirit of friendship, we must be accepting of all the exiles, and keep the borders open.\n\nOn the other paw, the elders of the clan wish to limit the number of exiles we accept into Clan Volsungr. While the clan is largely exiles at this point now, with the Princess being one herself, there is a reason the others were not let back in before. Not all of them are as harmonious as the clan, and some were expelled for crimes even many of the clan abhor. Though the borders should not be closed completely, they must still only allow those trustworthy to enter."
volsungr.2.a:0 "But what to choose?"

volsungr.3.t:0 "Wave of Volunteers"
volsungr.3.d:0 "With the borders open, thousands of polar bears have recently streamed into the clan, coming from a wide variety of places. While the vast majority of them have agreed to aid us in the unification of the polar bear lands, there are quite a few that even the younger members of the clan consider to have... suspicious backgrounds. Though there has been no issues of violence yet, it is clear these newcomers do not all share the principles of friendship and harmony. Though we will allow them to fight for the clan, we should also keep a close watch on these exiles."
volsungr.3.a:0 "Let us hope this was not a mistake..."

volsungr.4.t:0 "Guarding the Gates"
volsungr.4.d:0 "Over the past days, many bears have come to our clan seeking to join us from exile. Though there are many that the elders deemed fit and welcome to enter, there were still many others that were denied and forced to turn back to whatever land they came from. Whether they were deemed too insane, too brutal or simply against the principles of harmony, all of them would not have found a place in Clan Volsungr. Perhaps it was for the best that we rejected these polar bears, for now our clan is more united in purpose than ever before."
volsungr.4.a:0 "This was the right decision."

volsungr.5.t:0 "The Triple Alliance"
volsungr.5.d:0 "Wesslandia, the region to the north has always been the most normal to other creatures, making it the strangest for bears. The land is dense with forest and filled with game and berries, fertile enough to grow tubers and other such food. The animals there are standard in the sense to griffons or ponies, instead of the magical beasts standard in the rest of the land. Even its long coastline is ripe with fish, seals and other such creatures. Yet despite all these resources at their disposal, no clan ever became leader of the region to assert dominance over the foods and other clans. Even facing Nova Griffonian invasion the clans did not unify, instead reclaiming land and enslaving the griffons who had arrived.\n\nThis has all changed though, as the three current clans of Falsen, Benkestok and Brodkorb, products of a seemingly endless cycle of clans rising and shattering, have forged an alliance of equals. While something like this has never been seen before by the clans, it may be a result of their similar traditions and use of griffon servants. While their ability to cooperate as equals is admirable, the claims that the "Triple Alliance" as it was now being referred to was seeking to usurp power over the bears for themselves have many in the clan worried and believing that conflict is the only option."
volsungr.5.a:0 "How do we deal with this?"

volsungr.6.t:0 "Tripartite Diplomacy"
volsungr.6.d:0 "The clan leaders and Princess Eira had agreed to meet on the edge of the forest north of the mountains of Clan Volsungr, the general border that separated them from the Wesslandians. The arrival of both delegations were relatively uneventful, something that gave hope to the Princess and her companions. The fact that they had not used any grand shows of force or great threats against them usually used to intimidate an enemy clan into submission in such talks meant that they clearly wanted to speak on an equal footing.\n\nThe negotiations were long, and though it was mostly uneventful and civilized and most arguments were talked down through words, there was still a fair bit of fights and violence, with one Volsungrian leaving with a few broken ribs. The demands of the Wesslandians were small, only involving some basic concepts for future agricultural and economic plans of all things. Perhaps the rumors of them wanting dominion over all bears were just that, or perhaps the fear of being surrounded by other clans had driven them to open their minds. The end result is the same; the clans of Wesslandia now believe in harmony and are under our protection."
volsungr.6.a:0 "One step closer to unity."


volsungr.20.t:0 "Beating the Odds"
volsungr.20.d:0 "While Paw Wellington had defeated the clans of Wesslandia once before, Clan Volsungr would not be able to replicate the tactics of the despot to defeat the clans to the north in battle. They simply did not have the numerical advantage to afford such an attack, especially against the combined might of the "Triple Alliance". It was also clear that they would unable to win a long drawn-out conflict, so in typical bear tradition a large show of overwhelming force and victory would be needed to cow them into submission.\n\nOur forces met the three clans and their warbands at the river, a natural border and battlefield for the fight. Our warriors were outnumbered at first, being forced on the defensive against overwhelming numbers. That was until the elites of our army arrived, Nanooks clad in starsteel armor and weaponry. Having fought years worth of magical beasts in the mountains, the bears of the Triple Alliance proved no match and were utterly routed, ultimately ending in a crushing defeat for them. The leaders of all the clans quickly realized their forces were no match and came to admit defeat and recognize the superiority of both our clan and our principles of harmony."
volsungr.20.a:0 "A necessary conflict for unity."


volsungr.26.t:0 "Duel of Thunder"
volsungr.26.d:0 "The journey up north to Clan Svartpels was long and difficult. The land was cold and unforgiving, even for the polar bears, and to reach the clan itself one had to cross many mountains, hills and forests. And before they could even enter the fortresses of ice, Princess Eira and her entourage were all forced to duel panzerbjorn of Clan Svartpels just to prove their identity as bears. Eira had expected this, however, and had only taken along the strongest and seasoned elders to accompany her. As soon as they had defeated the panzerbjorn and come within sight of the Thunder Lord Torben, Princess Eira immediately challenged the clan leader to a duel.\n\nThe fight that followed was long and enthralling, drawing many from the clan to watch as the two leaders battled to assert dominance over the other. Though Torben was the strongest of the clan, having only been beaten once by Paw Wellington before, Eira was almost just as powerful and tactical. Even so, it was only by a matter of sheer luck that the Princess had managed to claim victory, exploiting the Thunder Lord's over-aggressiveness. And when Torben rose back to his paws, his expression was one of grudging respect as both he and Clan Svartpels swore allegiance to Princess Eira, the new unifier of the clans."
volsungr.26.a:0 "Sometimes the sword is stronger than the pen."


volsungr.29.t:0 "Continuing the Push"
volsungr.29.d:0 "With Wesslandia secured and under our banner, many bears in the clan are beginning to return to normal clan life, as with the safety of Clan Volsungr now they see no need to defeat the other clans yet. Our warriors want to return to their caves in the mountains, rest and prepare to fight at a later time.\n\nWe can not afford to give up, however. Princess Eira has reminded every bear of the necessity in uniting the clans once more, not just to ensure the safety of Clan Volsungr but of all polar bears. For while the clan may be secure, the longer the land remains divided the more our neighbors, especially the changelings see our weakness. Only together can bears stand and resist any foreigner who wishes to subjugate us, and so achieving unity must be done as quickly as possible. The speech seemed to have its intended effect, as many in the clan have taken up arms once more, ready to bring harmony to the rest of the land."
volsungr.29.a:0 "We can not stop now!"

volsungr.30.t:0 "Tyrants to the West"
volsungr.30.d:0 "Clan Scyfling, the former head clan of the polar bears, has long been led by the Despot known as Paw Wellington. They were the first to unite the clans into one, forcing all others into submission and taking a place of superiority and domination as the undisputed masters of the lands. They even imagined themselves as being blessed by divine favour, an aspect of their religiosity deeply embedded in the clan itself. Paw Wellington had continued to ignore the wishes of the other clans during his rule, something that had inevitably led to the situation occuring now.\n\nHowever, for all their faults, the achievements that Clan Scyfling have accomplished are undeniable. For even with all their mistakes in doing so, the Despot was the first to finally unite bears under a single banner. His expertise from other races is unparalleled in all the clans, especially in warfare, and both him and Clan Scyfling valued law and order not just in their lands, but all across the country. Without his leadership, the polar bears may have very well been conquered or subjugated by another race such as the changelings long before now."
volsungr.30.a:0 "But can they listen to reason?"

volsungr.31.t:0 "Enemies of the North"
volsungr.31.d:0 "Clan Svartpels, the "Lords of Thunder" has long been an enemy of Clan Volsungr. For many years, long before the clans were united, they waged many wars against us in an attempt to destroy what they saw as disgraceful and dishonorable to ursine tradition. While we had beaten them back time and time again, when Svartpels gained Scyfling as an ally in the unification campaign Volsungr suffered immensely as a result of the brutalization that followed. The clan had teetered on the brink of destruction, only narrowing saving itself by allowing the mass return of exiles such as Princess Eira herself which had further ostracized Volsungr from Svartpels.\n\nAnd yet for all its brutality, Clan Svartpels is still considered to be one of the most intellectual and scientifically advanced clans due to its seemingly contradictory stances on things. The clan itself is incredibly brutal and warlike, yet its leaders are cultured in both bear history and tradition. They opposed change and advancement when suggested, yet was one of Paw Wellington's most loyal supporters when he led the polar bear lands. And even with all their focus on the strength of a creature, they enjoyed the company of the penguins of all races.\n\nYet now it seems that they have descended into paranoia. For in the far north, they separated from the Despot in the first place believing that all the recent problems have been solely the cause of changeling infiltrators. Any bear that seeks to get close to the clan must fight a duel to prove their identity as a bear, something that may prove troublesome to overcome."
volsungr.31.a:0 "An enigmatic situation..."

volsungr.32.t:0 "The Princess and the Despot"
volsungr.32.d:0 "Princess Eira approached Clan Scyfling for negotiations expecting many things. A spiteful despot. A religious fanatic. A raging polar bear. A clan willing to do whatever it takes to regain control. She had entered the negotiations with a mask of frost and steel, determined not to show weakness to the despot.\n\nWhat Eira had gotten, however, was absolutely nothing like what she had expected. Paw Wellington was a former exile like herself, and it was clear that his experiences has molded him just as they had molded her. As the talks went on, Paw slowly began going deeper, talking about his motivations, his goals, his wish for a strong and united nation of polar bears like that of the griffons. How he truly meant the best for all clans and regretted his failure and the recent chaos across the land. Eira saw a whole new side to the Despot, one she had never even imagined.\n\nBy the end of the meeting, both had come to an agreement with only 3 tables broken. Clan Volsungr would lead the polar bears now, with some promises to Clan Scyfling about the matter of religion and order. And with only seven bears from the clan returning with serious injuries, it was all-in-all considered an outstanding success."
volsungr.32.a:0 "A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one."


volsungr.35.t:0 "No Compromise"
volsungr.35.d:0 "Despite the recent chaos, Clan Scyfling still remained one of the most powerful clans militarily. They of course had they Despot himself, Paw Wellington to lead them, as well as subjects in the clans of Onlartir. However, they were also lacking one critical thing, and that was unity. With Paw Wellington's failure to keep order, tensions between Scyfling and the south were at an all-time high, and their cooperation was at a breaking point.\n\nThe two armies of warbands met in the hills close to the border with Volsungr's territory, led by the Despot and the Princess respectively. Their numbers were close to equal, and though Clan Volsungr had their warriors of starsteel, Clan Scyfling still possessed great weapons of death, a force of artillery. At first, the battle seemed to sway towards Paw Wellington, as many bears of Volsungr fell to the great power and might of the artillery shells and tactics of the Despot. But cracks slowly began to appear in the enemy, as cooperation between the clans of Scyfling and Onlartir were weak. At one point close to an entire warband was destroyed by friendly fire from their own shells. Princess Eira, seeing this weakness took advantage immediately, creating unified assaults and breakthroughs through their lines, causing immense disarray. Their forces quickly starting to dwindle, they were forced to retreat.\n\nThis outcome continued in several other battles across the polar bear lands, as Paw Wellington's warbands were continuously pushed back simply from a lack of unity and command, something that our own armies possessed. The effect was almost immediate, as after it was clear they were on the losing side the various clans of Onlartir broke off from Clan Scyfling, instead surrendering to Clan Volsungr. The Despot, realizing that all was lost at this point, gave up soon after, affirming the loyalty of the west to Princess Eira and the principles of Harmony."
volsungr.35.a:0 "The Despot has been defeated!"

volsungr.36.t:0 "The Battle of Raumelf River"
volsungr.36.d:0 "The warbands of Volsungr and Svartpels met on Raumelf River, the natural border that separated Clan Svartpels' territory from the rest of the bear lands. Due to their suspicion against all other bears due to the recent chaos and suspecting changeling intrusion, it was clear that they would not be satisfied by anything other than a traditional battle and victory. Therefore, both sides were outfitted with nothing more than mere axes, weapons that Torben's clan were much more skilled in using. And even with Volsungr's clear numerical advantage, it was clear from the start of the battle that numbers didn't matter here, only skill, strength and conviction.\n\nIt was not over in any short amount of time. Quite the opposite in fact. Over the course of an entire week, bears fought each other head on, some resorting to their bare claws on the battlefield. It was a long stalemate as neither clan could gain the upper paw, until finally on the seventh day things changed. Princess Eira herself and the rest of the elders personally came onto the frontlines, as did Thunder Lord Torben and his panzerbjorn. As fighting continued to rage all around them, Eira barely managed to defeat Torben in battle, which truly marked the end of the conflict as the Thunder Lord stood back up and gave a single nod before announcing his surrender. Clan Volsungr had apparently proven themselves worthy, as soon after Clan Svartpels affirmed their loyalty to the Princess and to unity."
volsungr.36.a:0 "Success is the best show of strength!"


volsungr.39.t:0 "The Brighter Future"
volsungr.39.d:0 "At long last the clans have been unifed once more. Just like Paw Wellington did long ago, we have brought all polar bears in the land under one banner, but this time under the banner of harmony, principles and Princess Eira. And though we will soon take our place along with the other races of the world, be it with or against them, that is in the future. Now, the time for rebuilding has come, as we modernize and step forward into a new age together."
volsungr.39.a:0 "For unity and harmony!"



volsungrb.1.t:0 "What is Harmony?"
volsungrb.1.d:0 "Harmony is not a set ideology or a system of beliefs. It is not even a political system, really. While it is hard to exactly describe what it is, one thing that all bears can easily see is that there are many different ways to view it. We may have been the first clan to adopt it, but many clans, from Paw Wellington in Clan Scyfling to even Thunder Lord Torben in Clan Svartpels have their concepts which could easily be considered Harmony.\n\nTrying to force our exact principles onto the other clans would, in the end, make us no better than the despot we originally fought against in the first place. So instead, we will take these ideas that the clans give us, adopt them as our own into a new system, one built by bears, for bears. For only when every clan feels as part of a group can they truly be one nation, unified and harmonious."
volsungrb.1.a:0 "Every clan will have their voice heard."

volsungrb.2.t:0 "A New Princessdom"
volsungrb.2.d:0 "Bears of all clans gathered at one of the ice fortresses in Mathair Fearainn today, as the coronation of the first Polar Princess took place. It was a rather alien and foreign event for most bears, as they were used to the warlord-esque rule of clan leaders, the hard paw of the Despot, or the brutality of the Thunder Lord. A monarchy seemed like a far-off system more akin to something like the Penguins to the east, or the Equestrians to the far south. And yet, nobear objected as the crown was placed upon Princess Eira's head as all present knew that she was the one worthy to lead them.\n\nEira was not alone, however. Two bears of major importance were also present, Paw Wellington of Clan Scyfling and Thunder Lord Torben of Clan Svartpels. While still subservient to the Princess, many bears had already seen their role to play in the coming months, acting as advisors and consultants for the new ruler. These three bears, respected throughout all the frozen north will be the ones who decide the future of the bear clans, and usher in the new age of Harmony promised to all who live there."
volsungrb.2.a:0 "All praise Princess Eira!"


volsungrb.7.t:0 "Principles, Adjusted"
volsungrb.7.d:0 "Liberty, Democracy and Prosperity. These are the three principles that Kemerskai had outlined as key points to the future of his state in northern Griffonia. It is known that Paw Wellington took much of his inspiration for his ideas from his overseas travels in exile, and while parts of Kemerskai's work can been seen in his latest one, it is also very different from the President-Marshal's.\n\nNo part of this split is more telling than the stance on democracy. Due to Kemerskai's failure and regression to a dictator in the north, as well as the previous chaos in the bear lands, Paw Wellington has become increasingly skeptical of the bears' ability to rule and act for themselves. Instead, he now believes in the necessity of an enlightened figure to lead them, a figure much like he was trying to be before the re-fracturing of the clans. And though not many are fond of the memories of his past leadership, Harmonic values are also at the center of this new belief, one that we should at the least take into consideration."
volsungrb.7.a:0 "Quite an intriguing adaptation."

volsungrb.8.t:0 "The Pyramid"
volsungrb.8.d:0 "The latest work and idea of Thunder Lord Torben, "The Pyramid" can be described as many things. An ideology. A political system. An extension of the clan caste system that the polar bears have had for centuries. In simple terms, it is the idea that due to the ancient nature of polar bear society and therefore the superiority of the system, we are justified in leading and bring that harmonic way of life to others. It explains that the idea of a hierarchy is still harmonic as long as the bears who lead it are.\n\nWhile much of this is just the old ideals of Clan Svartpels recreated, there is a surprising new addition to the system. It places a new emphasis on inter-caste cooperation and the importance of still treating those lower on the pyramid right. That while those weaker and lower should have no ability to influence important things like leadership and government, they are still an important part of bear society and that it is the duty of those stronger to care and protect them. It is the strangest blend of harmony and clan values possible, and yet some cannot help but be attracted by the concept."
volsungrb.8.a:0 "An interesting system, but can it work?"

volsungrb.9.t:0 "Harmony in Nature"
volsungrb.9.d:0 "There are many things that it is important to be in harmony with. Harmony with yourself. Harmony with others. Harmony in a nation. And yet, one of the most important things to be in harmony with, one that even Equestria failed to achieve, is harmony with nature. The land, with all its creatures existed long before we did, and it will exist long after. We must not destroy it for our own ends now, but instead preserve it for future generations, keeping it in balance with our needs and wants.\n\nTo that end, the Royal Environmental Agency has been formed. With the sole purpose of ensuring the survival of species, monsters and the ecosystem, it will ensure we do not fall to the same mistake the Equestrians did. It will also study these various inhabitants of the far north, and give advice on how to plan for the future with nature in mind."
volsungrb.9.a:0 "Our lands will survive the modern era."

volsungrb.10.t:0 "Return of the Monsters"
volsungrb.10.d:0 "After many months and a great deal of effort, we have finally done it. Monsters, once a rarity in these lands due to declining populations and increasing modernity in the world at large, have once again become plentiful in the untamed wilderness. Wildlife in nature is thriving, as these beasts finally have a place to call home once more.\n\nOf course, this does come with the added danger of all monsters. Some are even able and certainly willing to kill an unprepared bear. However, we already know how to deal with and avoid these great and powerful creatures, while our enemies, those seeking to infiltrate or outright invade our society will not."
volsungrb.10.a:0 "A return to the balance of old."

volsungrb.11.t:0 "Plains of Snow and Ice"
volsungrb.11.d:0 "The tundra is in many ways the homeland of the bears. While it is true that many bears have left those lands for other places, such as the mountains in the case of our own clan, many still feel a natural affinity to the snowy flatlands scattered throughout the North. Despite the harsh conditions there, we know how to live off the land, navigate the eternally white fields to wherever we wish to go. And though there is no real roads in the tundras, bears still leave trails and markings for others to follow, a special kind of infrastructure much easier then almost any other. We may have lost some from keeping these lands untouched, but we have gained much more."
volsungrb.11.a:0 "Let it be our home forevermore."

volsungrb.12.t:0 "The New Age"
volsungrb.12.d:0 "After trial and tribulation, we have finally done it. After years, centuries even of clan fighting, of disunity, even in the times of Paw Wellington, the clans finally stand united as one nation, one cause. And that cause is Natural Harmony, the result of a blend of all bears and their ideas.\n\nOf course, our hardships will not end here. Nations beyond our borders pose an ever-clear threat to our new country, from the griffons to the ever-looming changelings. But we will stand proud, defeat these oppressive nations, and stand in friendship with our fellow harmonists against them. The polar bears will remain free!"
volsungrb.12.a:0 "To a new beginning!"


volsungrb.24.t:0 "Fate of the Queendom"
volsungrb.24.d:0 "While the warriors of the clans were occupied in massive celebrations at the defeat of the changelings, Princess Eira and the other clan leaders had to face a much more pressing issue: what to do with the broken remnants of their defeated foe. Some had proposed full outright occupation, but that was quickly shot down as the size and population of the changelings would make that almost impossible. In the end, a compromise was reach which satisfied all the bears present.\n\nThe majority of the Changeling Lands would be led by a new Harmonic changeling named Thorax, who has been running a resistance against the former Queen Chrysalis for a while now. They will still however be under major bear protection and supervision as they rebuild their nation. The rest of the territory, in particular Soryth and the surrounding wasteland will come under our direct control, as the concessions for all the death we had to face in war."
volsungrb.24.a:0 "The Menace of Equus is no more!"


volsungrb.28.t:0 "The Soryth Proposal"
volsungrb.28.d:0 "In the Great War against the Changeling Queendom, one of our less-renowned allies was the Polar Bears to the far north, a fellow nation of Harmony and friendship. And though many ponies do not think of them very often when the war is brought up, they played an important role in extending the conflict across a new front, distracting the Changeling forces from our own.\n\nNow Princess Eira, leader of the nation has come with a request. They seek to take administration of the hive of Soryth, one close to their border on the shores of Key Lake, as well as the surrounding area. The states in question are very unpopulated barring Soryth itself and considered general wastelands, though there are some resources of note in the region. How should we respond?"
volsungrb.28.a:0 "The Polar Bears fought hard beside us, they deserve it."
volsungrb.28.b:0 "Even with their help, these demands are absurd!"

volsungrb.29.t:0 "The Equestrians Accept"
volsungrb.29.d:0 "Seeing our invaluable support in the war against the former changeling menace, the Equestrians have accepted our request and transfered all the land in question, including the hive of Soryth to our protection. This is a great day for all Polar Bears, and a few bears are already asking for permission to settle on the newly acquired land, which is relatively unpopulated. The exception to this is the hive of course, the citizens of which we shall treat with respect as one of our own now."
volsungrb.29.a:0 "Let us celebrate!"

volsungrb.30.t:0 "The Equestrians Refuse"
volsungrb.30.d:0 "For whatever reason, the ponies have seen to deny our request for Soryth and the surrounding region. Perhaps they thought our contribution to the war effort was not enough to warrant it, or perhaps they wish to cater to their new subject in the Changeling Lands. Either way, our representatives have returned to the north disappointed, and this will not be a refusal we will forget anytime soon."

However if one encounters an entire swarm of bugbears, the only chance of survival would be a timely escape as even our direbear ancestors couldn’t defeat entire swarms by themselves. \n\nAnother danger of facing these beasts is that differently from most creatures of such size and might, bugbears are intelligent creatures, possessing a great memory and ability to work in large groups.\n\nDespite the dangers of facing such creatures, hunting bugbears is an activity which most prominent figures within the clan are expected to partake in order to show their might and combat prowess. However, this tradition has been followed by a somewhat interesting phenomenon as there are always several would be thunder warriors that do not show interest in slaying such beasts, rather wishing and attempting to tame them, sometimes with great results.\n\nOf course in traditional polar bear society such individuals were banished after being inevitably defeated by the larger members of the clan. Differently from most other outcasts who chose to travel more civilized lands, these bears would disappear into wilderness. They would spend their lives wandering through places least touched by civilization, taming bugbears and sometimes even more exotic and rare creatures.\n\nHowever the new leader of all polar bears and the overlord of the Changeling Northern Protectorate Bjornling has a completely different views from the leaders and elders that were deposed after their resistance efforts were crushed. During his years of exile he had gathered the many tamers that were scattered across Equus and convinced them to join his warband. The bugbear swarms that these exiles brought with them were particularly effective during the reconquest of the North, and thus the military and political leadership of the Northern Protectorate has decided that these bugbear tamers and their swarms should be reformed into support battalions and integrated into the armed forces of the protectorate to be used against the enemies of Changeling Hegemony.\n\nFurthermore, it was agreed upon that in order to gain even greater benefit from having access to such unique specialists, the talents and abilities of these former outcasts will be used to create institutions to prepare new tamers and tamed bugbear swarms in order to ensure that the armies of Northern Protectorate will never face danger of loosing the advantage these swarms of monsters provide."
