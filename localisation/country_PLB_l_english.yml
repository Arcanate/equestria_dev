PLB_yearly_review:0 "The Yearly Review"
PLB_yearly_review_desc:0 "For the half-decade that polar bears have been united under the blessed protection of Paw Wellington the country has been pushed towards modernity and perhaps even uniformity year by year. And some time after a new year comes, the newborn bureaucracy would present their report to the despot. The time has come for the fifth such report."

PLB_treasury_report:0 "The Treasury Situation"
PLB_treasury_report_desc:0 "While the implementation of the modernization programs have been rather... subpar... That can be carried into the following year. What’s important is that we have resources to continue them. It’s a good thing then, that we should still have plenty of resources to push these endeavours forwards."

PLB_request_financial_support:0 "Request Financial Support From Other Clans"
PLB_request_financial_support_desc:0 "Sadly, with the quite unexpected material situation at hand, we are forced to step down from our position of Clan Scyfling superiority and domination and request for material support from subjugated clans. We can only hope that this does not shatter the image of superiority and even divine favour we have formed."

PLB_establish_tax_system:0 "Take What We Need"
PLB_establish_tax_system_desc:0 "If they do not respond to politeness and friendly requests, perhaps they will respond to law and force. We will not ask anymore, we will take! The state needs to modernize to survive, and to modernize it needs resources, scribes and soldiers. And if we have to, All Father willing, we will take what we need with an iron paw!"

PLB_united_polar_bear_army:0 "Create a United Polar Bear Army"
PLB_united_polar_bear_army_desc:0 "For now the military of our country is comprised from Clan Scyfling warbands. This was a mistake as it seems it led to the other nine clans forgetting that they are our subordinates and have their own duties. Perhaps they won’t be so willing to forget when it becomes the duty to fight for the country under the leadership of Paw too."

PLB_nationalize_fish_farms:0 "Begin Nationalization of Fish Farms"
PLB_nationalize_fish_farms_desc:0 "One of the first things Paw Wellington did after his conquests was making the ownership of coastal fish farms more fair or in some cases even distributing clan Scyfling fish to less fortunate clans. This was not just an act of kindness, but also a show of power. Whoever controls the fish trade and capture controls the bears. Thus we must control most of the fish."

PLB_combined_research_initiatives:0 "Start Combined Research Initiatives"
PLB_combined_research_initiatives_desc:0 "While there is much we can learn from abroad, there is similarly as much that can be learned from within. Many clans produce and use unique adaptations of various technologies which should be spread to become accessible to all bears. For this noble goal we will demand that artisans of other clans are sent to our fortresses and teach us their knowledge so we can spread it across the North."

PLB_the_outcast_question:0 "The Outcast Question"
PLB_the_outcast_question_desc:0 "They might act arrogant and superior to us, now that they mocked our pride, our dreams and the concept of a great united bear state. But we still control the borders and they don’t. If we can’t get support and help from bears at home, we will just take it from the bears abroad. We will open up the borders and accept the countless exiles that roam the world back home."



PLB_scyfling_shall_not_surrender:0 "We Will Not Yield, We Will Not Surrender!"
PLB_scyfling_shall_not_surrender_desc:0 "It has been less than a decade, yet once more our clan is pitted against the rest of our kind. But just like the last time, All-Father willing, we will not surrender or yield until all of polar bears are yet again united by Clan Scyfling."

PLB_seize_their_fish_farms:0 "Restore the Fish Farms"
PLB_seize_their_fish_farms_desc:0 "The destroyed and sabotaged fish farms have been a bit of an issue we have neglected to address due to ever increasing issues before the collapse. However we can’t afford to do that any longer. The fish farms all across our owned lands must become operational again so that we may never find ourselves lacking."

PLB_strenghten_local_alliances:0 "Forge Local Alliances"
PLB_strenghten_local_alliances_desc:0 "There are many ice forts or even larger fortresses that are inhabited not by any of the great clans, but rather by lesser outcasts or those whose bloodlines never belonged to any clan. We have previously mostly ignored their interests and part to play in a united bear state. However that can still be fixed."

PLB_storm_their_fortresses:0 "Storm Their Fortresses"
PLB_storm_their_fortresses_desc:0 "While most of the northwest bear lands are owned and controlled by Clan Scyfling or bears lacking clan alignment there are still quite a few locations where the claws of Onlartir or Wesslandian clans stretch among what is ours. We must ensure we won’t be struck in the back and thus their castles and forts must fall!"

PLB_northwest_reclaimed:0 "Finish The Reclamation of the Northwest"
PLB_northwest_reclaimed_desc:0 "Fish are being caught in great numbers again. Larger and larger armies are being raised. And any presence of other clans that presents a danger to us has been eliminated. Now we can march outwards!"

PLB_the_march_west:0 "March West"
PLB_the_march_west_desc:0 "The fact that there was anything left that could revolt in Eastern Key Lake after the clans that persisted there were pushed out into the Changeling Lands for their treason is quite surprising. Reclaiming it should not be an issue."

PLB_gaze_south:0 "Turn our Gaze South"
PLB_gaze_south_desc:0 "Onlartir is an unforgiving land. Distant from the nourishing sea and even most rivers or lakes. Through it’s long history it has been invaded by changelings, rogue yak warbands, other bear clans and even a few failed griffon expeditions. No wonder such land has bred three entire clans of fearsome warriors..."

PLB_negotiations_with_clan_Kane:0 "Attempt Negotiations with Clan Kane"
PLB_negotiations_with_clan_Kane_desc:0 "Clan Kane is a rather strong force, being the only clan whose troops can match the fearsome Svartpels in melee combat and perhaps even possessing greater endurance. Subjugating them was hard before. But perhaps as a show of good faith and understanding, we can defeat them by word and not claw…"

PLB_negotiations_with_clan_goltung:0 "Attempt Negotiations with Clan Gotlung"
PLB_negotiations_with_clan_goltung_desc:0 "Even in the unforgiving land of Onlartir, Clan Gotlung was in the worst position. And yet they endure in their great forts and with their great shields. It took a long time to bombard them into submission the last time, though perhaps they don’t want their new fortresses bombarded into dust again and would rather talk it out?"

PLB_negotiations_with_clan_rozenkrantz:0 "Attempt Negotiations with Clan Rozenkrantz"
PLB_negotiations_with_clan_rozenkrantz_desc:0 "The shaman ruled Clan Rozenkrantz gazes into the northern winds and channels the power of winter itself like no other. It was only through outmaneuvering and overpowering them that we won. Something that took two great clans to complete. Perhaps we can convince them to gaze into the northern winds and see that our fates align?"

PLB_subjugate_clan_Kane:0 "Subjugation of Clan Kane"
PLB_subjugate_clan_Kane_desc:0 "Clan Kane of Onlartir might be comprised of proud and great warriors, each one perhaps being able to match any two or even three belonging to other clans. Yet we made them kneel once, and we can do it again!"

PLB_subjugate_clan_goltung:0 "Subjugation of Clan Gotlung"
PLB_subjugate_clan_goltung_desc:0 "Clan Gotlung might think themselves unreachable beyond their great walls once again, their fortresses rising higher than before. They had done the same last time we marched across the North uniting bears under a single banner. It didn’t help them then, and it won’t help them now."

PLB_subjugate_clan_rozenkrantz:0 "Subjugation of Clan Rozenkrantz"
PLB_subjugate_clan_rozenkrantz_desc:0 "Clan Rozenkrantz have refined their magical crafts like none among our kind have seen before during these five years. However we know the blessing of the divine is stronger than any magic of a mortal. Even if they think things have changed, they could never defeat the armies blessed by the All Father."

PLB_destroy_clan_Kane:0 "Destroy Clan Kane"
PLB_destroy_clan_Kane_desc:0 "There is nothing noble in what we must do, but it must be done. The great warriors of Clan Kane will be slain till the last by our might. None will survive to resist. Only guilt and regret will persist."

PLB_destroy_clan_goltung:0 "Destroy Clan Gotlung"
PLB_destroy_clan_goltung_desc:0 "It is brutal and wasteful, perhaps even absurd, but there is no other choice left to us... The great walls of Gotlung will collapse onto them, burying all beneath them, leaving only haunted ruin behind."

PLB_destroy_clan_rozenkrantz:0 "Destroy Clan Rozenkrantz"
PLB_destroy_clan_rozenkrantz_desc:0 "The northern winds will howl and fire will roar, but the blizzard of Rozenkratz shamanic might will go out. An entire legacy snuffed out, leaving the messages of the hales impossible to comprehend."

PLB_pacify_south:0 "The South is Ours"
PLB_pacify_south_desc:0 "Onlartir rests beneath the banner of Scyfling again, just like it did recently. However now the land of proud warriors and great shamans is truly devoted to our cause, something which we were unable to ensure the last time through our foolishness. But now, now we can be sure that there won’t be any more revolts."

PLB_gaze_east:0 "Turn our Gaze East"
PLB_gaze_east_desc:0 "Unexpectedly and perhaps in a surprise to not just us but everyone across the bear lands, the three clans of plentiful Wesslandia have aligned with each other, forging a sort of alliance of equals. Such a system has never been seen before among the bears and let’s hope that it has it’s faults, for if Wesslandia truly rises united, we would simply not have the numbers to stand a chance!"

PLB_negotiations_with_triple_alliance:0 "Attempt Negotiations with The Triple Alliance"
PLB_negotiations_with_triple_alliance_desc:0 "The so called "Triple Alliance" of Wesslandia is truly a foe too great to meet on the battlefield. While a position of equals is quite horrible when it comes to negotiations between bears, we can only hope that the Wesslandians have taken up a more pragmatic position on such matters from their griffon servants."

PLB_shatter_the_great_fortresses:0 "Besiege the Triple Alliance"
PLB_shatter_the_great_fortresses_desc:0 "A united Wesslandia would crush us easily. Yet with how the region is positioned, surrounded on all sides by enemies, be they one of the great bear clans or griffons, they could never fight us as equals. And thus one victory will pile on top of another until we will reach the other side of the bountiful Wesslandia."

PLB_shatter_the_alliance:0 "Butcher The Triple Alliance"
PLB_shatter_the_alliance_desc:0 "Wesslandia had united by itself, rose from formerly rival clans... They resisted us before, but now, with all that we have done? They would never accept our rule and we could never contain them... Only one option is left. To snuff out an entire region... Let’s hope the gods forgive us, because we could never forgive ourselves."

PLB_pacify_east:0 "The East is Ours"
PLB_pacify_east_desc:0 "The plentiful and great Wesslandia now rests beneath our claws. Despite it’s recent unification into a force which might have challenged and even defeated us, had All Father not blessed us, we were the ones who emerged triumphant against what would in any other case be impossible odds! And this time, our grip will persist for sure."

PLB_prepare_for_the_final_struggle:0 "Prepare for The Final Push"
PLB_prepare_for_the_final_struggle_desc:0 "We might have eliminated the threat the lesser clans had posed for us, yet to confront the great Clan Volsungr and fearsome Clan Svartpels we will need to prepare as much as possible. We will raise new forces and fortify our new borders in preparation for retribution and a great push."

PLB_question_of_clan_volsungr:0 "Question of Clan Volsungr"
PLB_question_of_clan_volsungr_desc:0 "Clan Volsungr is perhaps quite the anomaly within the polar bear territories. They used to be a rival to our former comrades in Svartpels, which meant that during the previous unification they lost extremely brutally. This forced them to accept many outcasts, which changed them, transformed them even. It is difficult to even think what would be the best way to deal with them now."

PLB_attempt_negotiations_with_clan_volsungr:0 "Attempt Negotiations with Harmonists of Volsungr"
PLB_attempt_negotiations_with_clan_volsungr_desc:0 "Under their new "Princess" - Eira, Clan Volsungr has redefined itself in an imitation of Equestrian rule. Perhaps the sort of Equestrian pacifism and desire to forgive has translated too? Maybe they would be willing to talk this out?"

PLB_subjugation_of_clan_volsungr:0 "Attempt Subjugation of Volsungr Harmonists"
PLB_subjugation_of_clan_volsungr_desc:0 "Clan Volsungr was made to kneel once. This will repeat again. No matter how much they copy Equestria, they will not be able to match the tactical prowess we learned from our years of exile in Griffonia."

PLB_destroy_of_clan_volsungr:0 "Bombard Volsungr Mountain Holds to Dust"
PLB_destroy_of_clan_volsungr_desc:0 "With what we have done, the Equestrian copy cats that are Clan Volsungr would never align with us and would never submit to us. The only way to ensure an enemy army is not hiding in those mountains, is to collapse them onto the Volsungr fortress within... Let’s hope the forged future is bright enough to justify this."

PLB_volsungr_defeated:0 "Yak Mountains are Ours"
PLB_volsungr_defeated_desc:0 "The mountains that separate our lands from the Yaks are said to be impossible to break through and fight in. Yet in our advance against Volsungr, we have subjugated these great mountains too."

PLB_question_of_clan_svartpels:0 "Question of Clan Svartpels"
PLB_question_of_clan_svartpels_desc:0 "Clan Svartpels were our most faithful allies during the first unification. Furthermore their elder - the Lord of Storms, Torben was a good, if distant friend to Paw Wellington. Yet now we stand opposed..."

PLB_attempt_negotiations_with_clan_svartpels:0 "Try a Peaceful Option with Svartpels"
PLB_attempt_negotiations_with_clan_svartpels_desc:0 "Clan Svartpels seems to believe that our mistakes are not our own faults but rather some sort of changeling driven conspiracy. With this in mind, if we can indeed convince them to join us as brothers in arms and our staunches friends and allies again."

PLB_subjugation_of_clan_svartpels:0 "Make the Lords of Thunder Kneel Again"
PLB_subjugation_of_clan_svartpels_desc:0 "While the belief of Clan Svartpels that our mistakes are nothing more than some foreign inspired conspiracy is strange, it is also reassuring as it means if we prove we are true bears they will most likely align with us again. However for Svartpels and Torben, the only way to prove such a thing would be through war..."

PLB_destroy_of_clan_svartpels:0 "Thunder And Lightning Will Not Save Them"
PLB_destroy_of_clan_svartpels_desc:0 "With how much they seem to be convinced everything bad is a conspiracy of changelings they will simply never accept what we did or why. There is an immense grief in having to turn on old friends. Yet for the future of bearkind it has to be done."

PLB_svartpels_defeated:0 "The North is Peaceful"
PLB_svartpels_defeated_desc:0 "Even the great Northern Shores now bend to the will of Paw Wellington and Clan Scyfling! Truly, if we can yet again reach our claw across this unbearable domain, our future should be blessed by the frost and spirits of our ancestors."

PLB_scyfling_victorious:0 "A Scyfling Victory"
PLB_scyfling_victorious_desc:0 "Yet again, for the second time in less than a decade, Clan Scyfling under Paw Wellington stands as the undisputed leaders of the polar bear race. And this time, our dominion is unquestionable."



PLB_scyfling_has_no_honor:0 "Our Allies Have Failed"
PLB_scyfling_has_no_honor_desc:0 "The absurd and the impossible has happened. The great polar bear unity, for which we fought shoulder to shoulder with the divinely inspired clan Svartpels and their lords, has broken. And there is only one way that could have happened, changeling infiltration..."

PLB_march_on_clan_anker:0 "Question of Clan Anker"
PLB_march_on_clan_anker_desc:0 "For one reason or another, Clan Anker, our ancient vassal and the closest clan to us culturally has been rather distant for some time. One would not think that they would betray us. But with the vile bugs seemingly everywhere, one can not be sure..."

PLB_push_south:0 "Begin Pushing South"
PLB_push_south_desc:0 "The clans of Wesslandia, lacking history, culture and honour, seems to be the one place where the ideas of our seemingly former Clan Scyfling allies endured and worked as its inhabitants unified under a so called "Triple Alliance". Though perhaps, there is a different reason..."

PLB_make_clan_brodkorb_kneel:0 "Wesslandian Clans Will Kneel"
PLB_make_clan_brodkorb_kneel_desc:0 "The Wesslandian clans might be numerous in both bears and griffon servants. And they might believe such numbers will grant them victory. But we remember, like always... We remember their strengths and their weaknesses from the last war. They will kneel against us again!"

PLB_grind_clan_brodkorb_into_dust:0 "Turn Wesslandia Into Dust"
PLB_grind_clan_brodkorb_into_dust_desc:0 "The newborn unity of Wesslandia and especially their strange newborn ambition is highly unbelievable in face of millennium of history. Perhaps they don’t even realize, but they had most likely been pushed into this direction by the Changelings.  And we cannot allow bears corrupted by such foreign influences to exist!"

PLB_wesslandia_in_our_claws:0 "Wesslandia is Within Our Claws"
PLB_wesslandia_in_our_claws_desc:0 "We marched through Wesslandia and the vast and populous land itself submitted to our will again, just like during the first unification war. Perhaps this is just the beginning, or perhaps the hardest struggle is already behind us? After all Wesslandians were neither great warriors nor historians, yet those that stand against us will not be as weak."

PLB_cut_off_outcasts:0 "Cut Off Roads From East"
PLB_cut_off_outcasts_desc:0 "The fact that the Wesslandians simply left their borders for various criminals and lunatics and cultists to seep into the lands from which they were banished is just more proof that despite their arrogance they never should have been allowed to rule. And now we must fulfill our duty as a Great Clan and close down the eastern roads."

PLB_drive_scyfling_back:0 "Start Pushing West"
PLB_drive_scyfling_back_desc:0 "Onlartir is inhabited by some of the proudest and militantly capable clans of polar bears and they have historically been some of our most faithful allies, even if the unification wars put us on separate sides. We have not forgotten such history, yet as we can see now as our forces clash again, they still haven’t learned to value history or symbols for that matter."

PLB_make_the_lords_kneel:0 "The Lords of Onlartir Must Kneel"
PLB_make_the_lords_kneel_desc:0 "If they do not wish to be our allies and brothers and sisters in arms they will kneel before us and admit not only that our will and steel is superior to theirs, but that the unity of bears is a goal far more noble than any rambles about surviving alone while surrounded by beasts far more dangerous."

PLB_the_only_lord_of_Onladir:0 "The Only Lord of Onlartir"
PLB_the_only_lord_of_Onladir_desc:0 "The clans of Onlartir defy us and our goals. Furthermore they claim that a great force already protects them. They lie through their teeth claiming it’s Clan Scylfing, our allies and friends. Yet there is no such proof. The only conclusion therefore, is that this is yet further Changeling corruption!"

PLB_push_out_the_last_remnants:0 "Tighten Our Grip"
PLB_push_out_the_last_remnants_desc:0 "It’s perhaps a good omen that even if it’s clans were infiltrated and pushed into their worst impulses, the land of Onlartir remained firmly in bear claws. Had we taken any longer, it’s certain that Changelings would have ripped it out of our domains as they had done with so many other domains of our race. And now, we won’t give them such a chance."

PLB_the_harmonists:0 "The Challengers From the South"
PLB_the_harmonists_desc:0 "Clan Volsungr are our ancient rivals, ones which we have respected for all our history. It’s thus in great sadness we remember that they were nearly annihilated during the unification wars. They fortunately endured, yet are a perfect proof for why accepting exiles would only weaken a clan, corrupted as they are now with Equestrian weakness."

PLB_make_clan_volsungr_swear_loyalty:0 "Make Clan Volsungr Swear Loyalty"
PLB_make_clan_volsungr_swear_loyalty_desc:0 "Volsungr might be weak, corrupted by clear and open weakness of foreigners and obsessed with the most impossible and absurd ideas. Yet while they must submit to us, our of respect for what they once were, we will allow them to persist and endure. Perhaps with our show of force they will remember what they have lost?"

PLB_eradicate_clan_volsungr:0 "Break Clan Volsungr"
PLB_eradicate_clan_volsungr_desc:0 "It’s clear, Volsungr has not been corrupted by the acid that is changeling influence. However they are affected by a disease far worse - the so called "Harmony". An ideal that undermines the very basis of our society and chances at survival. Thus the perversion will be ended and Clan Volsungr will be remembered as one of proud warriors from now on."

PLB_harmonists_broken:0 "Rivals No More"
PLB_harmonists_broken_desc:0 "With this victory, the rivalry that has existed between clans of Volsungr and Svartpels for centuries and perhaps even millenia has been put to rest. From now on we won’t have to worry about an opposing army rising from the Yak mountains in an attempt to corrupt the rest of our race with their weakness."

PLB_capture_the_mountain_passes:0 "Secure The Mountain Passes"
PLB_capture_the_mountain_passes_desc:0 "The Elders of Yak Mountains and Onlartir seemed to treat themselves as our equals or betters, yet again they seemed to ignore that the roads from both east and west into our lands were open, allowing for a surge of radicals, lunatics and those that would align themselves with the Changelings. Yet another mistake that is ours to fix."

PLB_clan_scyfling:0 "Our Brothers in Arms"
PLB_clan_scyfling_desc:0 "Clan Scyfling, our former, and we can only hope, current friends and greatest of allies. It is with them that we marched during the unification wars and now we march to their realm now that the road lies open..."

PLB_make_the_subjugators_kneel:0 "Maybe Not All is Lost..."
PLB_make_the_subjugators_kneel_desc:0 "While the collapse of Clan Scyfling domain is unexpected and perhaps frightening, it’s also reassuring! It means our friends and comrades in arms fight and resist their brethren that have been turned to the side of Chrysalis like how we saw in Onlartir. We will march to help them and crush all those that rebel!"

PLB_crush_the_subjugators:0 "There is Nothing Left for us Here..."
PLB_crush_the_subjugators_desc:0 "With lands of Scyfling tearing themselves we can only assume the worst, all of those that are our friends are gone, with only enemies and corruption remaining. With sorrowful hearts we will have to clean this last domain of our gone friends and ensure they that are remembered as the heroes they were."

PLB_victory_over_subjugators:0 "Realm of Scyfling Liberated!"
PLB_victory_over_subjugators_desc:0 "We have overcome the bloodshed that had overtaken the ancient domains of Clan Scyfling and have destroyed any and all those that oppose our most noble of goals. Though we can only hope such betrayals don’t happen again." 

PLB_triump_of_might:0 "Our Greatest Triumph"
PLB_triump_of_might_desc:0 "A difficult burden has now fallen to our shoulders. We have achieved victory against traitors and corruptive influences, yet now a far more difficult duty falls to us - the duty to govern and protect not just our own clan, but all bears within our lands."



PLB_scyfling_has_no_competence:0 "This is Insanity!"
PLB_scyfling_has_no_competence_desc:0 "We cannot tolerate such stupid and spiteful actions any longer! Clan Scyfling and Paw Wellington have proven again and again, that they do not desire to govern in true representation of all bears, rather merely desiring to turn everyone else into an extension of their own. Thus it falls to us to reforge the state they forged from blood into something better."

PLB_the_war_within:0 "The War Within"
PLB_the_war_within_desc:0 "Even if we desire to advance onwards and reunite the bears under a more proper, moral and harmonic goal, we must solve our inner issues at first, for it seems the older and younger generations have been divided by the opening the borders, sometimes through destruction of fortifications, that Paw Wellington has done as one of his last actions..."

PLB_a_new_generation:0 "A New Generation Emerges"
PLB_a_new_generation_desc:0 "Even if we must respect the elders, the younger generation is right. In both principle of friendship and more pragmatic needs for numbers, we should accept any and all bears that offer their help for us. Perhaps when the war is done we can create a better policy towards the countless exiles, but for now, the borders will be open."

PLB_wisdom_of_elders_prevails:0 "The Wisdom of the Elders Prevails"
PLB_wisdom_of_elders_prevails_desc:0 "The caution of the elders is right. There is a reason why even if our Princess and her friends were allowed back in, countless other’s were not. There are many exiles which were forced to leave not because of their arrogance or weakness, but rather for their crimes and insanity. We should not simply take anyone back in."

PLB_the_war_without:0 "The War Without"
PLB_the_war_without_desc:0 "We are united, willing and harmonious. Now the time has come to finally march outwards and reunite the polar bears under a far more moral, harmonic and proper manner. Let us hope harmony can persevere against both barbarity and blind fanaticism."

PLB_gaze_north:0 "Turn Our Gaze North"
PLB_gaze_north_desc:0 "It seems that perhaps the ideas of reasonable equality and friendship are not lost on the Wesslandians, for they have formed an alliance of their own in order to survive in this difficult period. Yet mayhaps we should be vary of their new-found unity too..."

PLB_extend_our_claws_to_benkestok:0 "Extend Our Claws to Wesslandia"
PLB_extend_our_claws_to_benkestok_desc:0 "The Wesslandians have always been the clan more touched by civilizations that, even if barely, fit more with harmonious ideas we ourselves aspire towards. Perhaps we could extend a claw of friendship towards them, showing them and perhaps everyone else, that we do not repeat the same mistakes as Scyfling."

PLB_swipe_our_claws_at_benkestok:0 "Swipe Our Claws at Wesslandia"
PLB_swipe_our_claws_at_benkestok_desc:0 "The "Triple Alliance" of Wesslandia very notably, and without any hiding towards that fact, desires nothing less than subjugation of every other bear clan beneath their claws. While we oppose unnecessary conflict, this is one of the countless cases where there is no other choice."

PLB_our_flags_over_wesslandia:0 "Our Flags Over Wesslandia"
PLB_our_flags_over_wesslandia_desc:0 "The Clans of Wesslandia have now understood why the bears need a harmonist system and the beautiful future we promise to them and now admit our authority. Our flags wave over their holds and the roads to north and west lays open. Now we will be able to bring the enlightenment of harmony to all that live in the "polar bear" lands."

PLB_reclaim_root_farms:0 "Reclaim Root Farms"
PLB_reclaim_root_farms_desc:0 "Wesslandian land is perfect in growing the few species of tubers that endure in the climate and that the whelps and other "lessers" within most bear clans subsist on. As chaos consumed the bear lands, we lost our access to the pseudo-farms where these were grown for a short span of time, with rather disastrous results. Tubers are not the preferred food of a bear, but they are enough to subsist for now."

PLB_secure_fish_roads:0 "Secure Fish Roads"
PLB_secure_fish_roads_desc:0 "While we can of course subsist on tubers and roots, a bear clan cannot endure for long without fish. Yet again our unfavourable position led to issues here. The routes were cut off, the farms aligned to us taken over. It took some time to re-establish these roads. Yet now we can feel like a proper clan again."

PLB_open_up_seal_hunting_grounds:0 "Open Up Seal Hunting Grounds"
PLB_open_up_seal_hunting_grounds_desc:0 "Seals, walrus, sea elephants and various other beasts of similar type are not exactly rare on the rocky coasts of the northern seas, yet they are considered something off limits for most. For after the creatures were nearly driven into extinction, consumption of such meat was only allowed for elders and most fearsome of warriors. Let’s spoil our veterans a bit."

PLB_domination_is_the_only_option:0 "Remember the Crimes of The "Uniters""
PLB_domination_is_the_only_option_desc:0 "While we cannot be attacked or besieged anymore, our troops too numerous and our land too vast to be overtaken by either Scyfling of Svartpels, we cannot rest now even if some claim that it would be best to wait and properly prepare. No, we must remind our warriors and our citizens for why it’s so important that we unite bears as soon as possible!"

PLB_the_despot:0 "The Despot"
PLB_the_despot_desc:0 "Our views towards Paw Wellington and his clan of fanatics and bloodthirsty zealots is perhaps somewhat muddled. For while we cannot help but feel disgusted at many of their actions and spitefulness, would we even be here without them?"

PLB_scyfling_emmisarries:0 "Send Emmissaries to Clan Scyfling"
PLB_scyfling_emmisarries_desc:0 "Paw Wellington might be a despot, but he is not insane or even perhaps not as cruel as he pretends to be. After all, he spent much time among races far more pragmatic and less stubborn than most bears. Perhaps an attempt at negotiations could lead somewhere?"

PLB_we_are_but_part_of_nature:0 "We are but Part of Nature"
PLB_we_are_but_part_of_nature_desc:0 "We bears are not the masters of nature, nor are we equals with it either. We are one with nature, ourselves part of a larger system and spirit of the north, and we each do our part just as any other plant, animal or even monster does. And by coming to an understanding with the other parts that make up nature, we can better understand not just it but the world at large."

PLB_building_towns:0 "Turn Fortresses Into Towns"
PLB_building_towns_desc:0 "Traditionally, bears have lived on their own in grand fortresses of ice and stone, symbols of their strength and power.

By encouraging bears to turn these buildings into their own towns, we will be able to work together on projects and issues better."

PLB_establish_connections_with_outcasts:0 "Establish Contacts with Outcasts"
PLB_establish_connections_with_outcasts_desc:0 "Even as many bears have already returned home from exile with recent events, there are still many outcasts out there, those who have traveled the world and seen many things we can only dream of. By seeking out and making contacts with such outcasts, we can perhaps learn something from their experiences and adopt them ourselves."

PLB_economic_harmony:0 "Economic Harmony"
PLB_economic_harmony_desc:0 "An economy must always be in tune with itself, flexible and ready to take whatever role is needed of it.

PLB_harmonic_enlightenment:0 "School for Gifted Bears"
PLB_harmonic_enlightenment_desc:0 "One idea that the Princesses of Equestria had was a school for the talented, where they could be specially taught to become the best with a few shining stars even becoming Princess Celestia's personal protégés. We shall take this idea for our own, make a "School of Gifted Bears" for ursines who are found to go above and beyond. Who knows? Perhaps Eira will one day find a student or heir of her own."

PLB_our_own_crystal_city:0 "Our Own "Crystal City""
PLB_our_own_crystal_city_desc:0 "The real Crystal City could be considered one of the wonders of the world, a massive landscape of its own with millions of crystal ponies. Why not make our own? Clan Volsungr's holds are unfortunately unsuitable, so the hills of Wesslandia will do instead. It will be the first metropolis of bearkind."

PLB_viceroyality_system:0 "Viceroyality System"
PLB_viceroyality_system_desc:0 "The Crystal Empire, outside of their capital is a highly decentralized nation, with regions largely operating under the control of their regional governors and little to no oversight being applied. Under an official title of Viceroy, the clan leaders will now be left to their own devices, free to manage their lands as they see fit. They will know how to better do so anyway."

PLB_centralization_in_weslandia:0 "Centralize Our Holdings in Wesslandia"
PLB_centralization_in_weslandia_desc:0 "With the final act of massively centralizing Wesslandia under the direct authority of Princess Eira, the entire country has in many ways become a splitting image of the Crystal Empire. The Princess has complete control over her domain, that of a massive city by bear standards, with the rest purposely neglected for their own benefit. Eira's commands may not carry far anymore, but where they do, they are law."

PLB_a_princess_cannot_be_without_a_prince:0 "What is a Princess Without a Prince?"
PLB_a_princess_cannot_be_without_a_prince_desc:0 "A Princess must have her consort to rule together. And that consort must be of the same level as the Princess if they are to be worthy. Eira knows this, and she also knows that in the lands of ursines, there are only two that meet those qualifications."

PLB_despot_and_the_princess:0 "The Princess and the Despot"
PLB_despot_and_the_princess_desc:0 "Paw Wellington was the only other bear to ever unify the clans under one banner, even if temporarily. He is Eira's predecessor in some ways, just with a different title, and so he will be found wherever he is and take Eira's paw in marriage as the first royal consort."

PLB_expand_constitutionalism:0 "Law and Justice to All!"
PLB_expand_constitutionalism_desc:0 "The important principles for any country, that being order, law and justice have already taken root in polar bears, but it is time to take that one step further. By creating an official constitution which enshrines these principles among bears, we can give all the clans these fundamentally crucial rights."

PLB_compatibility_of_faith_and_constitution:0 "Ensure Religious Support"
PLB_compatibility_of_faith_and_constitution_desc:0 "Religion can be one of the best sources of unity for any group, bringing together many into one under a single figure, whether it be a god or a simple priest.

PLB_beuty_and_the_beast:0 "Beauty and the Beast"
PLB_beuty_and_the_beast_desc:0 "Thunder Lord Torben may not have a title that most would consider in a normal noble hierarchy, or seem like the kind of bear who could care for trivialities such as marriage. But his strength and in some cases heroism is a quality that many would desire themselves, and makes him in other ways the perfect Prince for a Princess. He is the one meant for Eira."

PLB_adapt_the_pyramid:0 "Ensure Everyone has Their Place"
PLB_adapt_the_pyramid_desc:0 "Society is meant to be in a strict hierarchy, with the weakest at the bottom and the strongest at its peak. Everyone has a place in this pyramid, and though those below will not be forgotten, it is the duty and the right of their superiors to fight and care for them. This is the natural order of things."

PLB_some_are_meant_for_heroism:0 "Some are Meant for Heroism"
PLB_some_are_meant_for_heroism_desc:0 "There are those that truly go above and beyond what a normal creature or even bear can do, who can only be described as nothing less than heroes.

While it looks completely ordinary on the outside, the courier has stated that it is of great importance, being from the Element Bearer of Kindness herself, Fluttershy.

PLB_align_with_cadence:0 "Align with the Princess of Love"
PLB_align_with_cadence_desc:0 "Given that Equestria is no longer a safe option to align with, at least for the moment, we must instead look towards the other bastion of Harmony in recent years. Cadence, the alicorn of love is part of the Equestrian royal family, and having her and the Empire on friendly terms would be a great benefit to us both now and for future prospects with Equestria, should they ever recover."

PLB_an_interesting_package:0 "A Rather Interesting Package"
PLB_an_interesting_package_desc:0 "The threat of a fallen Equestria is everlooming, and as such the Crystal Empire has sent us a curious package to apparently aid in defending ourselves. It is not a weapon itself, instead they are just blueprints and schematics.

PLB_minority_agreements:0 "Gunworks Agreement"
PLB_minority_agreements_desc:0 "The Nova Griffonians are much more advanced industrially, having great military factories that spew out weaponry. Our own griffons in Wesslandia are not as modern as they are, but instead have created new and innovative ways to create, forced out of necessity. Trading our knowledge for theirs would be mutually beneficial to both of us."

PLB_join_guardian_initiative:0 "Join the Guardians Initiative"
PLB_join_guardian_initiative_desc:0 "The griffons have created a new program called the "Guardians Initiative" which involves armed forces going all across the world to protect liberty and freedom and help safeguard themselves.

PLB_our_brothers_in_spirit:0 "Align with our Siblings in Spirit"
PLB_our_brothers_in_spirit_desc:0 "Long has the Yak race stood in strength close by.

It only stands, then, that them and us would make natural friends and allies."

PLB_yak_bear_defence_pact:0 "Yak-Bear Defence Pact"
PLB_yak_bear_defence_pact_desc:0 "Even with our shared history, we have never actually signed any formal treaties with the Yaks to the south. In fact, the only real bonds that we had shared before our recent diplomatic moves were the ritualized combat we had regularly. That should change now, and a pact of non-aggression and friendship will cement our unity."

PLB_yak_bear_military_initiative:0 "United Military Initiative"
PLB_yak_bear_military_initiative_desc:0 "The Yak army and our own could learn much from each other if given the opportunity.

PLB_an_unexpected_ally:0 "Align with an Unexpected Friend"
PLB_an_unexpected_ally_desc:0 "To our complete surprise, the changelings to our west have adopted harmony just as we have. While they were once our eternal enemy, especially under the rule of Chrysalis, it seems a drone named Thorax has taken over and started them down a new path. Despite being incredibly unorthodox, we will always befriend a fellow nation of Harmony."

PLB_northern_beacon_of_harmony:0 "Northern Beacon of Harmony"
PLB_northern_beacon_of_harmony_desc:0 "Even being relatively new, the changelings' committment to Harmony around the world is actually quite admirable.

PLB_a_little_gift_in_an_iron_box_desc:0 "The changelings, with our recent bettering of relations have offered us a curious gift, strange weapons of steel that they say will make up the future of warfare.

PLB_not_a_force_of_reaction:0 "Not a Force of Reaction!"
PLB_not_a_force_of_reaction_desc:0 "We will not just sit idly by while our enemies grow stronger beyond our borders. No, instead we will seek out and fight them first, destroy them before they can destroy us! We will defeat them on our terms, and bring them Harmony by force!"

PLB_the_changeling_tyrant:0 "The Changeling Tyrant"
PLB_the_changeling_tyrant_desc:0 "To our west lies Queen Chrysalis and the hives, a nation bent on nothing less than the complete subjugation of all of Equus.

PLB_economic_mobilization:0 "Prepare Our Forges"
PLB_economic_mobilization_desc:0 "The Changeling nation is much more industrialized than we are. With their greater landmass and headstart on modernization, we could never hope to match them in a number of factories or production lines.

PLB_military_mobilization:0 "Prepare Our Citizens"
PLB_military_mobilization_desc:0 "Even if each polar bear is able to kill ten changelings, it will not matter if the enemy is able to overwhelm us with sheer numbers.

PLB_fortify_the_northern_front:0 "Prepare Our Borders"
PLB_fortify_the_northern_front_desc:0 "A few fortresses spread throughout the western border will not be enough to hold the line in the slightest.

PLB_upa_weapon_shipments:0 "UPA Weapon Shipments"
PLB_upa_weapon_shipments_desc:0 "With our new pony allies to the south, we have been receiving new, much more modern weaponry and military technology to aid us against our joint enemy.

PLB_upa_northern_corps:0 "UPA Northern Corps"
PLB_upa_northern_corps_desc:0 "The United Ponies Alliance has created a new force comprised of only their hardiest and most capable ponies to aid us in the far north, the Northern Corps.

PLB_sorynth_occupation_zone_desc:0 "The Changelings have been defeated by the joint efforts of ourselves and the Equestrians, a new nation formed out of the ashes dedicated to Harmony. And yet, we did not fight this war for nothing in the end.

PLB_the_griffon_tyrants:0 "The Griffon Tyrants"
PLB_the_griffon_tyrants_desc:0 "The griffons have always been a dangerous and volatile race, prone to fighting and warfare as shown on Griffonia. Many in the clans were not surprised to see our neighbors in Nova Griffonia fall to anti-harmonic ideologies. It is time to crush these tyrants."

PLB_their_worst_excesses:0 "Punish Their Worst Excesses"
PLB_their_worst_excesses_desc:0 "While fully de-industrializing Nova Griffonia is at this point infeasible, there are some particular companies and factory owners that are greater offenders to Harmony than others.

PLB_what_to_do_with_griffons:0 "What to do with Griffons?"
PLB_what_to_do_with_griffons_desc:0 "Now that the threat has been resolved, many are wondering how we shall deal with the rest of Nova Griffonia.

PLB_the_perfect_frontier:0 "The Perfect Frontier"
PLB_the_perfect_frontier_desc:0 "To the griffons, the Frontier was a cold, unrelenting wasteland, a place filled with monsters and other such nightmares.

PLB_the_yak_situation:0 "The Yak Tyrants"
PLB_the_yak_situation_desc:0 "Prince Rutherford was once the one leader of the Yaks to the south, in solitude and isolation. And like ourselves, he opened the nation to Equestrian Harmonic values and the world at large. However, the Jaks rose up against him to maintain their tradition, and other non-harmonic elements began to fester in the nation. We must save what is left before it is too late."

PLB_maybe_jaks_had_some_good_ideas_desc:0 "Though their reasons were misguided, the Jaks did have a point in their breakaway against Prince Rutherford. While isolation is foolish, tradition is something to be respected and honored. We will de-industrialize their major cities, disarming them against us as well as letting them return to their old way of living, just as the Jaks wanted."

PLB_what_to_do_with_yaks:0 "What to do with Yaks?"
PLB_what_to_do_with_yaks_desc:0 "The Yaks have many similarities to us, possessing similar traits and strength. They would fit in well with our nation, and our way of life in the North. Of course, that same reasoning could be used for why they should be allowed to rule themselves..."

PLB_griffon_naturalization:0 "Griffon Naturalization"
PLB_griffon_naturalization_desc:0 "Even with our troubled history, we hold no ill intentions towards griffons as a whole. Instead, we want to foster cooperation between our races, have us live together in harmony under one nation.

It now falls to us to save them from themselves."

PLB_what_has_to_be_done:0 "What Has to be Done"
PLB_what_has_to_be_done_desc:0 "Pingland did not fall to a foreign invader or some sort of natural disaster. No, it was anti-harmonic radicals working to subvert them and take power for themselves. We have no choice now but to excise these tumors completely before they take root once more."

PLB_push_back_penguin_industrialization:0 "Push Back Penguin Industrialization"
PLB_push_back_penguin_industrialization_desc:0 "Factories are a tool just as any other, and just as any other tool they should be taken away from those that misuse it.

PLB_princessdom_of_polaria:0 "Proclaim the Princessdom of Polaria"
PLB_princessdom_of_polaria_desc:0 "With our expansion into non-historical bear lands, we have taken many races other than our own under our banner.

PLB_racial_harmony:0 "Racial Harmony"
PLB_racial_harmony_desc:0 "Our destiny of harmony was never meant to be for bears alone. Every race under our banner, every creature who chooses to call these lands home will be welcomed and find a place here, for only together are we truly the strongest we can be. Race will not divide us, and despite our many differences we will always have our similarities that bind us as one."

PLB_under_bear_protection:0 "Under Bear Protection"
PLB_under_bear_protection_desc:0 "The other nations and species have proven themselves too misguided, too weak to live independently on their own. We, the bears, are the only ones who have shown time and time again that only we are strong enough to protect those who cannot protect themselves.

PLB_expand_mountain_holdings:0 "Fortresses Across Yakistan"
PLB_expand_mountain_holdings_desc:0 "Since the defeat of the Yaks and Jaks, many bears have asked to be allowed to settle down south with the clans and build their fortresses near the Yak tribes.

PLB_build_mints:0 "Built the First Mints"
PLB_build_mints_desc:0 "Having the gold is good, but it does nothing for us if it just sits around in our fortresses collecting dust. Solid gold bars may sell well, however the risk of getting sold out and paid less than the true price is not one that we are willing to take. Instead mints will be made all across the country, to produce our very own national coinage."

PLB_adopt_more_conventional_warfare_desc:0 "Bears have fought both each other and outsiders since the dawn of the race itself, and many clans use ideas generally similar to each other in certain ways, such as always remaining on the offensive. It has proven to work well so far, so why replace something successful? More bears know how to fight like a panzerbjorn than a nanook."

PLB_wesslandian_mass_deployement:0 "Wesslandian Mass Deployment"
PLB_wesslandian_mass_deployement_desc:0 "In terms of the Wesslandian armies, they know and taught us a single thing; that enough numbers can overwhelm any force.

PLB_mass_armour_deployement:0 "Paw's Armour Reserves"
PLB_mass_armour_deployement_desc:0 "Paw Wellington has a rather large amount of ursine armor in storage within Clan Scyfling's territory, equipment meant for panzerbar.

He took the schematics of Republican artillery pieces back with him to Clan Scyfling, and now it is our turn to use them against our enemies."

PLB_engine_driven_armour:0 "Stalliongradian Mechanization Theories"
PLB_engine_driven_armour_desc:0 "The future of warfare lies not just in being stronger, but also faster. The formerly Equestrian region of Severyana, now collectively known as Stalliongrad has researched deep into this area, theorizing various doctrines involving the use of mechanized forces in place of their standard warrior infantry. It seems to at least be an idea worth digging into."

polarbear.1.t:0 "The Yearly Review"
polarbear.1.d:0 "Chill spread through the air as Paw Wellington let out a heavy breath. He flipped over another page of the manuscript, looking through the somewhat amateurishly written runes and numbers. He missed the typed out text on easy to handle white or yellow paper he would read from during his exile in Griffonia. However even if it would take time to properly read through the report, the impressions from skimming through were not good. The progress was even slower than the previous year. Less reforms finished, not enough farms and manufactories finished and of course Key Lake plans unsuccessful like always... \n\n"Is everything to your liking, Elder?" the whelp that had delivered the report questioned. Paw had almost forgotten the lesser bear was there, as it waited for any kind of response.\n\n"Thank you for the concern, but everything is fine. You may go ho... You may retreat to your quarters." The whelp bowed it’s head and left the chamber, closing the whalebone door behind it.\n\nWellington laid down the leather manuscript on the iron table and stood up from a chair of bone and chitin. He approached the window of clearest ice and gazed into the welcoming blizzard outside.\n\nWhat was the mistake that he was committing, what was the failure? Why were there so many setbacks in his plan to turn the north into a proper state? When Grover of Griffons united his kin there was nothing like that. The Empire he forged in but less than a decade stood united and prospered. Of course Grover had earned the blessing of Boreas even before his great conquests... \n\nPaw scratched his chin."
polarbear.1.a:0 "Perhaps All-Father doesn’t find me worthy yet?"

polarbear.2.t:0 "Empty Cellars"
polarbear.2.d:0 "This shouldn’t have been a surprise. After all, modernizing an entire country was not something that would have been cheap or easy for any one clan. So much steel and coal was required for modernizing the production, so much gold was needed to buy griffon products which bears simply couldn’t produce yet.  A permanent process of modernization for almost half a decade should have been something to be proud of, considering it was all purely on the resources of a single clan...\n\nYet Paw didn’t feel pride. If anything he was angry, though not at his clan. After all, Clan Scyfling had done the best it could with resources available. No, he was mostly angry at himself. He shouldn’t have ignored how much loot there was left from the bear unification and not just assume it would last them a decade. And now they only had fish left to trade with the world. Iron was too important after all. Of course there was another possibility, something that the elders of other clans would most definitely react to with cub-like glee and sadistically exploit, but which was necessary."
polarbear.2.a:0 "Let’s hope I don’t have to break them again for this..."

polarbear.3.t:0 "The Clans Refuse to Provide Financial Support"
polarbear.3.d:0 ""You can leave now, thank you for bringing the news." Paw Wellington tried to sound as polite as possible as the whelp left the room. He might have been called "The Despot" or "The Tyrant" and if his old friends from Nova Griffonia saw him now they would definitely say the same, but he remembered that lesson in Aquilea, to control a large populace one needed to use both terror and kindness.\n\nOnly when the whalebone door closed and sealed the chamber shut did the paw of the Clan Scyfling Elder impact the table as Paw Wellington allowed his frozen rage to seep out. He knew the elders had received the requests, he knew they heard what was asked and required and he most certainly knew they had the resources to comply with the request. He had spies and informants among their ranks after all. Yet almost everyone, except the ever so dutiful Elder Torben of Clan Svartpels, claimed that their clans had fallen onto hard times or simply didn’t respond. It’s as if they took him for a fool! Had they forgotten what happened just half a decade ago? Did they want to go the way of Gullfodt? No, perhaps they simply didn’t understand the importance of such resources, especially when they were being asked and not forced… Maybe they felt this helps their rival clans? Perhaps they felt his hold would be weak with so many clans?"
polarbear.3.a:0 "All-Father willing we will show them wrong..."

polarbear.4.t:0 "The Greatest Betrayal "
polarbear.4.d:0 "Paw Wellington roared into the air, frozen air streaming outwards from his jaws. He tore through the manuscript on the table, scratching the steel table. This was absurd, outrageous and extremely uncharacteristic for the species. At first they displayed almost griffon like ability to reinterpret the orders and demands he had sent out. Then they, in a fashion more similar to changelings than any other species in just how disgusting it was, backstab and betray him in absurd acts of self destructiveness by destroying their own farms and fleets as if just to spite him! But nothing compared to this! To attack the panzerbjorn of one’s tyrant without a proper reasoning was breaking any and all laws! By the All Father this was a betrayal greater than what had killed entire clans! They would have to be punished, seven other clans have to be punished in some way. But when Paw thought about what sort of brutality would have to be invoked as a show of power in such a situation... No, he couldn’t do something like that... Perhaps he had gone soft or too weak, he assumed Torben would do it without thinking too much,  but contemplating such mass destruction, even in a state of such rage made him pause. There had to be some other way...\n\nPaw Wellington knelt beneath an ancient statue dedicated to the All Father. A creation of frozen stone, shaped into a strange, yet awe inspiring bear-like armoured beast, once marking the midpoint of a road between Clan Scyfling and the countless clans that used to exist on the western side of Key Lake. However now it was used as an indication of land where the rule of the Hive of Soryth began. Paw Wellington would travel to this monument monthly if he could, both to give his respects for the greatest of divinities and to visit the few fortresses remaining here that kept watch so that Chrysalis didn’t get any ideas. It would have been nice to visit other similar fortifications scatted across other empty borderlands across all of the Polar Bear owned North...\n\nA realization dawned for Paw Wellington. A show of power that other clans would be forced to respect. Something which could also be considered a true punishment for all their wrongdoings! He gazed up at the pseudo-ursine statue again."
polarbear.4.a:0 "Thank you All Father!"

polarbear.5.t:0 "No Honor for Them in War Like This"
polarbear.5.d:0 ""Has he gone truly mad?" The Grand Elder Ase of Clan Kane growled as one of her own spawn, though with the helmet it wore she couldn’t remember which, not that it mattered really at this point, continued describing the sort of absurd, unnecessary and even treasonous to the bear way of life "reforms" that "Paw Wellington" was trying to enforce through the use of the new "recruitment stations" staffed by the panzerbjorn of his own clan.\n\nFrom the very beginning she was sceptical of such dreams and ambitions of the despot, after all he seemed to be so aligned towards what griffons and changelings represented. It was disgusting to say the absolute least, for a polar bear to try to imitate species so minor and frail. It’s why she and lesser Elders agreed to simply ignore the request for resources for trade. It just stank of weakness of griffons and changelings. Though it seemed that Scyfling realized their mistake and now they were demanding, not asking. So at least there was something respectable there. And so Kane humoured the request. Only to find out this absurdity. The Scyfling were not organizing a force of attack or defense against any sort of attack! They were not even arming weaklings that don’t deserve it in the typical fashion for "Paw". No, they were in fact trying to forge an army loyal to one bear- "Wellington" himself! In betrayal to all duties of tyrant to lesser and lesser than tyrant, the bears of other clans were being forced to train to fight and die not for their clan, but for the despot!\n\nAs a clan that had put their axes down for Paw and whose leaders fell beneath his clans, Kane couldn’t just rebel, but as laws and duties were broken on all levels, Kane simply could choose not to listen to such orders.\n\nWhile Kane didn’t openly announce such defiance, word, rumour and news travelled by themselves, and soon most other clans had joined in to simply refuse to send the bears of their clan to serve in the armies organized by Paw. In fact, many seemed to feel so insulted that they stopped patrolling the western borders with the Changelings, something that was previously done willingly, forcing Paw Wellington and Clan Scyfling to compensate with bodies of their own."
polarbear.5.a:0 "...."

polarbear.6.t:0 "Let the Waters Burn"
polarbear.6.d:0 "Fritjof knew they would would be exiled into the wastes of Nova Griffonia where they would perhaps fall prey to cannibals or radicals over this. He was no bear, couldn’t even compare in mass or combat prowess and thus stood no chance in a duel. He was but a griffon after all, born of servants, and even when given a place at the table of the warriors for being an exception among his kind, he was still not on par, neither in power, nor perception by others and those above. However this also meant that if an "owlbear" committed a betrayal of such proportions it would not be blamed onto the clan, but rather the accusations and retribution would fall purely onto his warband, for most bears still believed that even uplifted griffons couldn’t truly persist and understand the nobility, brotherhood and honour of the clan system.\n\nIt wasn’t fair of course, it wasn’t just in any true way. It was perhaps even absurd that he was sacrificing the future of his own and others like him who managed to carve their way up from mere servants into warriors. But as the Falsen fleet burned in the distance and the plans of the Despot of exerting more control over the Wesslandian clans was shattered, Fritjof couldn’t help but grin."
polarbear.6.a:0 "My life for the power of the clan!"

polarbear.7.t:0 "Beneath the Mountains"
polarbear.7.d:0 "Eira, the Princess of Clan Volsungr, surveyed the "scribes" of Clan Scyfling that had presented themselves for her. Apparently Paw Wellington had sent out the closest his clan had to scientists to "teach" other clans the advancements he had brought back from his travels in Griffonia and learn whatever science and magic that other clans had created. She couldn’t help but notice a rather patronizing tone with the request, especially humorous as the despot referred to his own "scientist" equivalents, something rather outdated and medieval sounding.\n\nThough it didn’t matter how Paw Wellington had framed this request, or well, more order if anything, she knew that it was just another way to attempt controlling and stifling other clans, instead of actually trying to understand or care why everyone except Svartpels didn’t consider him a proper tyrant. Clan Volsungr had to comply of course, even if she was more Equestrian than Polar in character after her exile, Eira still understood and respected the laws of her homeland. But she also understood intricacies of modern politics. She just hoped that the elders of other clans were smart or cunning enough to see the easily exploitable mistakes in how Paw Wellington had worded his order....\n\nAs the "scribes" were guided out of the hall to be led to the chambers within the great Volsungr mountain fortress where they could rest, Eira turned to one of her former exile bodyguards and murmured."
polarbear.7.a:0 "Keep them occupied with pointless knick knacks as long as we can."

polarbear.8.t:0 "The Question of Outcasts"
polarbear.8.d:0 "Of course, even if we are starting to take in outcasts in substantial numbers in an attempt to undermine the power of our subordinate clans, we still have to decide how far we go. After all, if a bear is exiled out of any lands inhabited by his kinds, instead of simply his own clan, then they must be quite the radical and in some cases even transgressors against all laws mortal and spiritual. Perhaps many of them had reformed in exile, perhaps they have dropped their absurd and amoral ideas that they fought and fell for. However we can never be sure, especially considering how long polar bears can hold down on their ideals, even during the darkest days of exile. Paw Wellington knew of course, being one of such dishonored and radical exiles who was banished who kept up his ideals of modernization and adaptation of griffon like methods for decades.\n\nHowever even if we are doing this in what is a clear insult and attempt to show power over other clans, it would perhaps be wise to not anger them too much. Perhaps limiting ourselves to the least dangerous groups would show both our power and dominance when it comes to where it matters to the other clans while also not causing too much outrage. Of course, we can simply accept everyone back and hope that when conflict arises we have enough new recruits that we are simply numerous enough so that no other clan thinks they can win. However, taking the more radical option could lead to losing our only current and firm ally, Lord Torben of Clan Svartpels..."
polarbear.8.a:0 "Let’s limit ourselves to the most reasonable."
polarbear.8.b:0 "All bears are welcome back."

polarbear.9.t:0 "Stupidity"
polarbear.9.d:0 "The news spread like lightning of course, even for an untamed land without proper roads and communication, as was the intent. Across the polar bear inhabited lands clans reacted in absolute disbelief as they learned of what had happened... And they rose in revolt. Paw Wellington had been testing their patience for very long and now it was a perfect chance.\n\nIn a giant fortress beneath the great mountains that stretched across lands of yaks and bears and even griffons, the princess of Clan Volsungr started marshalling her forces to save her kind from this idiot despot and perhaps show her kind a better way than this.\n\nNear the most northern shores, where even the hardiest of beasts couldn’t endure the brutal winds, a lord of lightning and thunder took the news, of both the new order and disbelief. His friend could never order something like this, could he? No... It must have been an interference from none other than the accursed Changelings! Yes... They must have manufactured this to invade! And thus the Lord of Thunder too raised his forces, depleted as his clan was from years of war.\n\nAnd of course, the Despot himself, left with no other options due to his own rash actions, prepared his armies for another march of unification."
polarbear.9.a:0 "I can still prove I am worthy!"
polarbear.9.b:0 "I can still save us all!"
polarbear.9.c:0 "I can still save our freedom!"


polarbear.11.t:0 "Insanity"
polarbear.11.d:0 "The news spread like lightning of course, even for an untamed land without proper roads and communication, as was the intent. Across the polar bear inhabited lands clans reacted in absolute disbelief as they learned of what had happened... And they rose in revolt. Paw Wellington had been testing their patience for very long, but this was pure insanity which should have never been allowed in the first place!\n\nIn a giant fortress beneath the great mountains that stretched across lands of yaks and bears and even griffons, the princess of Clan Volsungr started marshalling her forces to save her kind from this mad tyrant and prevent the nightmare that would rise from this.\n\nNear the most northern shores, where even the hardiest of beasts couldn’t endure the brutal winds, a lord of lightning and thunder took the news of the new order in disbelief. His friend could never be that mad, could he? No... It smelled of a conspiracy and something foul and disgusting... It smelled of bugs... No other creatures could have manufactured something so insulting yet destructive! They must done this because they are afraid! They must have known what awaited their wretched kind if the North was truly united! But they would not be allowed to win! And thus the Lord of Thunder too raised his forces, depleted as his clan was from years of war.\n\nAnd of course, the Despot himself, realizing now that he had ruined his dream, that he would now have to put down every clan, armoured himself with grim determination and an idea of salvation and marshalled his forces."
polarbear.11.a:0 "I do what must be done..."
polarbear.11.b:0 "I will save them from the enemy!"
polarbear.11.c:0 "I must save them from madness!"



scyfling.1.t:0 "We Will Not Yield!"
scyfling.1.d:0 "Such chaos... Such devastation...\n\nYet again had bears tearing into each other in open war, even worse than before... Paw Wellington had annulled all duties, alliances and tyrant-subjugated connections between any and all clans. It was surprising to know that all clans had complied to the demand. However the horror unleashed by this untamed, wild war had tore at his very being. It was a result of all what he had done. All of his mistakes... In front of his clan he continued looking stern and strong as they gathered for war. But on the holy grounds he felt so weak, so confused...\n\nWhat had he done wrong? He tried to mimic the great Emperors Grover I and II, sometimes also tapping into the successes of liberator Alexander Kemerskai. Had these been wrong inspirations? Had he not noticed something integral...\n\nPerhaps he should have taken Torben seriously back then, when the Lord of Thunder joked that he has become too griffonized for his own good, too ignorant of clan systems and too adamant in his ideas of superiority, that he needed allies not subjects... Perhaps that might have saved him then. But now... Now it seemed that there was only war..."
scyfling.1.a:0 "And what do I do now?"


scyfling.3.t:0 "Minor Clans of the South"
scyfling.3.d:0 "For as long as the oldest scriptures of both bear and foreign origins have recorded, our race has always been one of warriors and warmongers. We waged war on each other and on yaks and when changelings and griffons pushed into our frozen realm we fought them too. Some even say that we have waged war on the land itself as we had to fight both the climate and the beasts before we tamed even our very homeland. Our very society has been defined by this struggle. Every leader, every influential figure, even the greatest and most revolutionary smiths and scribes have been great fighters for only through combat can one show the strength of their ideas to their betters.\n\nYet even among a society that glorifies war so much, the three clans of Onlartir are considered above and beyond when it came to militarism. For it was them who stood for centuries as a wall against rogue Yak Khans and Changeling hordes, all while continuing a seemingly eternal conflict between each other. It had perhaps been a good thing that the land was as desolate and unfitting to sustain life as it came, for had Onlartir clans not been the least numerous ones, one of them would certainly overran the north far before Paw Wellington had returned from exile. Though even with their lacking numbers, the subjugation of the Onlartir clans was the most difficult of campaigns during the first unification and took the entire might of both clans Scyfling and Svartpels. Something which would be impossible to repeat now."
scyfling.3.a:0 "Yet here we are now..."

scyfling.4.t:0 "Negotiations With Clan Kane"
scyfling.4.d:0 "It was an outcome the warlords of Clan Scyfling, and especially Paw Wellington would not have expected. Instead of waiting for an onslaught from superior numbers, Clan Kane had chosen to raise their forces and strike first. And thus two armies met on a frozen field...\n\nPerhaps such a meeting place was the best for the sort of negotiations that happened between Paw Wellington and Grand Elder Ase. For what better place for two warlords, one potentially on rise and another on seeming decline, than on the field of what could soon be a battle?\n\nHowever, in disappointment to some, that battle would never manifest, for an agreement would be reached. Though in a true bear fashion, quite a few red puddles would soon appear on the light blue ice and several of the "diplomats" were forced to leave due to broken or even shattered bones as the more difficult disagreements were solved by duels till near death. Even Paw Wellington himself was forced to take on several Kane elders to truly prove the necessity of a proper and united polar bear army, though he couldn’t fully show his own competence as Ase of Kane wrestled him to a standstill.\n\nThe final solution was perhaps not the most satisfactory for either group, but Onlartir forces would fight for Clan Scyfling, as long as Paw Wellington upheld his duties as a proper tyrant, allowed them to be led by their own warlords in battle, and took several panzerbjorn as military advisors."

Paw Wellington gazed at the fortress seemingly built to stop another Scyfling march against the closest thing Clan Gotlung had to a capital...\n\nOne could sense the smugness that the Gotlung bears radiated as Paw Wellington and his best panzerbjorns had marched through their, admittedly, impressive set of fortifications, though only the cubs and perhaps some of the more enthusiastic and young warriors would openly show it.  It was not the sort of silent egotistic pride of how griffons would act and of course not the almost absurdly cublike and comedic arrogance of ponies. Both of those were tolerable. Yet when it came to bears, it was almost always a feeling of predatory superiority. A bear that smugly grins at you sees not a defeated adversary or sub-par acquaintance, they see defeated prey, even if it was merely a moral or psychological victory. And with such a mentality spread out among the Gotlung panzerbjorn and perhaps elders, for some time it seemed negotiations would fail.\n\nThe final agreement was far more beneficial towards Paw Wellington and Clan Scyfling than they would have assumed from what in an other case would be an admit of defeat. Yet perhaps the way the Kane situation unfolded had convinced the Elder Council of Gotlung to rethink their previous position. The agreement was rather simple if anything. A simple tyrant-subject relationship with one simple demand - that being that the elders or potential leader of Clan Gotlung, if one would rise to such rank ever again, would be allowed to partake in creation and enactment of new law in order for their autonomy and traditions to be protected."

The local beasts were similarly dangerous, often being more magical than flesh due to the closeness to the power of northern lights. Yet it was from the top of the tallest mountain in Onlartir that the shaman lord of Rozenkrantz gazed upon the untamed power within the heavens...\n\nThe sight at the peak of the mountain was surprising to say the least. The Shaman Lord of Rozenkrantz, one who had abandoned their name and existence before achieving such position was sitting on a throne of ice and bone almost unprotected, with barely half a dozen others of its order and just a tiny group of panzerbjorn as guards. It would have been absurd to assume that this was everything, yet it was hard to imagine where else any other bears would have hidden in such an unforgiving terrain. It was of course an attempt to create a sense of power. To potentially intimidate an opponent with the implication that they could be taken down with nothing more than a small warband. Yet while it was somewhat impressive, it couldn’t exactly compare to power plays one would see in Griffonia.\n\nPaw Wellington had expected a bit more defiance, aggression, even absurd demands under threats of unseen forces perhaps, yet the Shaman Lord had been mostly... compliant and agreeable. Perhaps this had been because Clan Rozenkrantz had gazed into the winter lights and seen futures where Scyfling had come to crush them and and assumed this was an attempt to demand subservience? Whatever was the case, the final agreement was reached relatively soon. The duties of tyrant and subject were reiterated to be remembered in front of winter lights so that the divine could hear them this time and punish the transgressors if one side would break the deal, something that Paw Wellington was not the most enthusiastic about yet still performed the deed. The only thing demanded beyond the traditional duties was that shamans of Rozenkrantz would accompany Paw Wellington during his campaign and rule as both assistants and observers. Something which was yet again promised to the skies."

Instead of waiting for an onslaught from superior numbers, Clan Kane had chosen to raise their forces and strike first. And thus two armies met on a frozen field...\n\nPerhaps, had the armies of Clan Scyfling been led by any other Elder, they would have most likely lost if they tried to fight Clan Kane in anything approaching a traditional manner. They were the more numerous force of course, nearly outnumbering the enemy three to one. It was understandable, a single minor clan could never raise enough troops to match a Greater Clan. Yet as always, the ursines of Onlartir were more than large and strong enough, that had they cut through the distance, lines would shatter and victory would be theirs. It was an ancient strategy, simple, and for the longest time, difficult to counter, even if Kane lacked heavy support. However, such a tactic required ground that could be charged through. And thus, in what was a rather dishonourable and sordid action, the land between the armies was bombarded by artillery and explosives, making the ground simply impossible to charge through, trapping them in a defensive position which was charged by the more numerous Scyfling forces. Yet had Paw Wellington not subdued Grand Elder Ase of Clan Kane and forced her to surrender in the middle of the brawl into which the battle had devolved, the victory would have been bloody and potentially not even belong to Clan Scyfling.\n\nHowever even in defeat, Kane refused to put down their axes and bow, for they claimed Paw Wellington fought them without honour and showed the same disrespect for tradition he had shown before in countless other situations. It seemed as if Kane would only break if a true bloodbath ensued. Yet it didn’t take that, for instead of ordering another assault, Paw Wellington merely invited the Clan Kane Elders to a "weapon demonstration". Whatever the weapon was shown to them, the demonstration ended with a tyrant-subject agreement. Though this time, both sides were truly chained with duties."

Their new fortress was impressive to say the absolute least, something that Paw Wellington couldn’t deny even while he and his best panzerbjorn were tearing through the corridors and halls within the allegedly impenetrable fort, yet it was built for heavily outdated ways of war, not accounting for modern artillery and explosives, which just like the first time, punched holes through its great walls. And yet still, despite being outnumbered and their walls broken through, Gotlung fought tooth and nail, often literally, for every corridor and anything resembling a defensible position.\n\nOf course, eventually the elder council and their troops stepped down, surrendering against the superior forces and abilities of the despot whose chains they thought they had thrown away. However this time Paw Wellington had promised, in front of everybear of Clan Gotlung and Clan Scyfling, that this time the traditions and autonomy of Gotlung would be respected so that a war like this would not repeat."

For at every turn and every step of the march to the top of the mountain they were harassed and engaged by panzerbjorn and shamans. By themselves these small groups would cause no danger in anything resembling proper battle. Yet they would engage the advancing Scyfling column from the sides, attacking through what had to be some sort of magical coverage of wind and snow, slaying or at least tying up dozens of warriors before seemingly retreating into the mountain itself. Sometimes entire streams of snow and ice would appear, cutting off advancement for tens if not hundreds of bears, who were now forced to dig through as they were engaged by the enemy. The only solitude was in the fact that even in something approaching hit and run tactics Rozenkrantz warriors refused to merely strike and retreat. Instead they would stay and fight until they themselves were wounded or felled or such a fate happened to a Scyfling bear. Though more often than not it was the Scyfling bears that fell. And yet the column kept advancing higher and higher, Paw Wellington leading from the front, inspiring his increasingly exhausted forces.\n\nThe battle of the peak would be a far smaller engagement than one could expect for an engagement for the future of an entire clan as barely a hundred bears, almost evenly split between the clans tore at each other. Initially the shaman clan seemed to be the ones that would come out on top, yet they had no reserves and their troops were tied up on the mountain itself, while Clan Scyfling warriors, if slowly, were seeping into the battle in greater and greater numbers. Eventually this had become too much and the Shaman Lord had to lay down his axe and surrender, followed by his clan.\n\nThe renewal of oaths would have been almost a mirror of the last time, and had it indeed been the same, the bitterness of both defeats would perhaps continue to fester, had it not been for the fact that this time the battle was fought and oaths were given under the Winter Lights."

After all, Clan Kane was famous or even infamous for the size and strength of their warriors. Had this been a traditional engagement, Clan Kane would have charged into their enemies seeking to overwhelm them through sheer force of what could be likened to an avalanche of angry armoured beasts, all while said enemy would be bombarded with either cannons or the closest thing to machine guns that was available. Something which in this engagement the Kane force was lacking. If one subscribed to the traditional bear sense of honour, Clan Scyfling would not use their own heavy weapons. Yet it has been decided by Paw Wellington, that this would not be allowed to be a traditional engagement. This was not part of a war... It was part of an extermination. And for this duty, something never before seen or even imagined for most bears, and most likely not widely seen even among Changelings and Griffons - "hunting rifles" meant to take down dragons. Barely a dozen of such weapons were available to Clan Scyfling, yet they were the turning point. The very first volley tore through the Clan Kane avalanche, which was then hit by artillery. After that it was a slaughter...\n\nWith their greatest warriors and even their elders gone, slain perhaps quite unfairly in battle, the fortresses didn’t hold for long either. They were rather quickly turned into nothing more than butcheries. Only some of the whelps or cubs were spared, for they were too young or too... lacking in intelligence and physical might to cause any danger or hold any grudge.\n\nAnd such was the end of clan Kane."

This way was far easier indeed, far less costly than it would be any other way. Yet also so much more brutal and disrespectful for the dead. Clan Gotlung had thought they made an unbreakable fortress, yet they had done nothing more than prepare themselves a mass grave...\n\nArtillery, explosives, the few dozen anti-dragon rifles and even several improvised flame-throwers, all unleashed their fury on the walls of what any other bear force would have seen as the greatest of modern fortresses. Perhaps, had it been any other force with any other intent, they would have stopped their bombardment after a few days. Maybe they would give up after the dozenth time Gotlung panzerbjorn had sallied out of the fortress, crushing through Scyfling forces. But Paw Wellington and his forces were here with a grim purpose and they would not retreat...\n\nAnd eventually the fortress collapsed, segment by segment, wall by wall - burying the best and brightest of the clan beneath it.

Clan Rozenkrantz was the only one among clans of Onlartir whose "capital" fortress was not in a somewhat easily accessible location, rather the Skybreaker Peak was surrounded by lesser fortifications on all sides, which had to be taken or at least tied up in combat before one could march on the sky-rending mountain itself. And thus the entire elder and leader generation of the Clan was slowly pushed back while being forced to watch as their entire clan was obliterated, bit by bit. And they channelled any and all magics and other forbidden forces that was available to them. Yet this was not enough and eventually it all came to the peak itself where the nameless Shaman lord fell beneath the claws of Paw Wellington and his best panzerbjorn and shamans were crushed under the power of the dozen griffon made anti-dragon rifles that Clan Scyfling had brought up to this height for the sole duty of extermination.\n\nThe only survivors of Clan Rozenktranz extermination were too young or too low on the clan hierarchy due to lacking magical or combat talent.

scyfling.34.d:0 "Wesslandia has always been the region of polar bear lands which is the most strange and wondrous for the bears, yet perhaps the most normal for most creatures that do not thrive in winter and cold. It’s forests are plentiful of both berries and game and stretch on seemingly forever. The game itself is rather more similar to what one would see in "normal" forests of Northern Griffonia or even Severyana instead of the strange half magical beasts that roam most of the land. Even the land itself is incredibly fertile, bearing tubers and plenty other mostly edible, if bland and long growing, arctic plants. Even the Northmost sea seems to be more plentiful in fish and seal near the region. Yet despite all of this, no great clan or great warlord arose from this land as clans, instead of growing to eclipse all others would shatter over access to the best fishing or farming spots. Even in face of potential conquest and annihilation at the hands of Nova Griffonian expeditions the clans didn’t unify, merely reclaiming huge chunks of land where griffons had begun to settle as their masters in the west were simply unable to administer it properly and turning the would-be conquerors into nothing more than servants for ursine overlords.\n\nCurrently the land is occupied by three clans - Falsen, Benkestok and Brodkorb, all of which are merely a few decades old as they were merely the result of yet another cycle of a clan growing in power until it shatters. Though this time it seems it took longer for unique traditions to develop as the three clans all use griffon servants and primarily share traditions, with the exception of Falsen, whose members seem to be fascinated with sea and shipbuilding . Perhaps it’s these reasons for why the leaders of these clans managed to so easily agree between themselves to forge an alleged alliance of equals, something that has never been seen before among bears. Similarly worrying are claims that this "Triple Alliance" desires to usurp power over the bears themselves."

scyfling.36.d:0 "The meeting took place not within a great fortress, not a fort, not even a battle camp, but rather within a simple forest slightly outside of the land controlled by the Wesslandian clans. Apparently the three leaders of the alliance decided that such a point, located closest to "historically neutral territory" would be most fitting. That by itself was a worrying sign as they didn't attempt to amaze Clan Scyfling with some great show of force or brutal implications, rather throwing an indirect insult and implication that Paw Wellington never controlled Wesslandia and its lords. An attempt at insult and undermining authority far more similar to court jabs of Vedina than anything most bears would do. A worrying development, yet Paw Wellington had spent time within said noble courts and would not be undermined by a pale imitation.\n\nNonetheless negotiations took quite some time, and despite the attempt of appearing more civilized and reminiscent of more "advanced" clans in a seeming misunderstanding of Paw Wellington’s intentions, the negotiations did result in a substantial amount of spilled blood and broken bones, with even Paw Wellington getting a few broken ribs. Yet a final and decisive agreement was reached. Surprisingly enough, despite the claims of grandeur and even seeming desire to rule over the entirety of ursine kind, the "Triple Alliance" didn’t possess much when it came to actual ideas of what sort of domain was desired, beyond some basic concepts for an economic and agricultural policy out of all things. Perhaps they had simply not prepared to go that far. Though there was always the alternative that being besieged on several fronts which they most certainly were, prevented any solid plans to be drawn out. Whatever was the case, the three lords agreed to be integrated back into Paw Wellington’s domain as long as their word on what is done with the griffon servant caste is final."

Yet this campaign was not a lightning fast march through seemingly barely resisting land. This time it was a slow and brutal grind with not enough heavy weapon support and most combat devolving into melee brawls. Whatever artillery or heavy equipment that there was in the Scyfling army, was not enough for an engagement that large as it stretched in pockets from the very sea to the mountains that designated the border between polar bears and yaks.\n\nYet victory was achieved by Paw Wellington, eventually, and not through a method which any clan would consider honourable or even remotely traditional. For it was by using weapons which were kept only for cases where extermination was the only true option - "anti-dragon rifles” of Nova Griffonian production. Only a few dozen of such weapons were available to Clan Scyfling and they were deemed to not be suitable for engaging foreign enemies due to clunkiness, slow rate of fire and even issues properly aiming such weapons. Yet against the stubbornness of traditional Panzerbjorn tactics? It was perfect to say the absolute least. And thus it was deployed against a tiny part of the "Triple Alliance" frontline, obliterating several warbands. With such application of localized destruction, the Wesslandian clans were left reeling, their line shattered without any seeming potential reserves. A repeat of the last pacification followed as the lords were forced to lay down their weapons in front of Paw Wellington and admit their status as subjects. One could only hope that this time Clan Scyfling could build up proper connections, for if Wesslandia rebelled once again, there was no telling if victory would be possible."

scyfling.49.d:0 "The "Triple Alliance" was perhaps the most numerous and some might even say powerful factions within the ursine territories. It may have even been true, if one had simply judged by numbers. Yet for all their numbers of bears and all potential forces raised from the griffon servant caste, they lacked the technological and strategic edge and were not allowed to realize that this was not a typical bear conflict of tradition, honour and melee prowess, rather it was a war of extermination. And thus they were not and simply could not be ready for the weapons that were deployed against them. Their armour and barricades stood no chance against rifles, if weapons of such scale could even be called that, meant to slay dragons. The griffon auxiliaries, even if they had grown to be able to sustain the great colds of polar bear lands still lacked the natural cold of their masters and feathers and furs they were clad in caught fire rather easily even when rather primitive flamethrowers were deployed against them.\n\nAfter the front was cleansed it came time for the countless fortresses and other various locations that belonged to the clans which were now left woefully lacking in any possible defences. The purges of the "Triple Alliance" forts were even more pitiful than the slaughter at the front lines and even caused some of Scyfling to question the righteousness of the cause and actions of Paw Wellington. Of course none of them dared to disobey or challenge the Despot or his best warriors to a duel.\n\nThe final remnants of the Wesslandian clans at the fronts with Clan Scyfling and Clan Svartpels lasted the longest, yet surrounded on all sides and their homes destroyed they didn’t stand a chance."

scyfling.50.d:0 "Clan Volsungr were often historically seen, if the stories of the oldest among the ranks of polar bears and passed down legends were to be believed, as a distant, strange and even disgraceful and dishonourable clan. This was in no small part due to the fact that the clan didn’t have any tradition of armoured warriors and they seemed to have never used the traditional large axes, the weapon that any proper polar bear warrior would carry as their primary armament until the last few decades. Rather their greatest warriors were so called "Nanooks", hunters that preyed on the magical beasts that filled the mountain ranges. Furthermore instead of dwelling within fortresses of stone and ice forged in unforgiving wastes, Volsungr would hide within the depths of the mountains as if surrendering to the elements in a manner more fitting for Diamond Dogs than any proper ursines. Yet there were two reasons for why, despite all the rumours and behaviour, nobody dared to challenge Volsungr’s right to exist. Firstly, despite not using the traditional polar bear weapons, the clan possessed several entire halls of starsteel armour and weapons within their unbreakable mountain home. Secondly, Clan Volsungr had a long history of both friendship and ritualized wars with the Yak clans south of ursine lands. As Yaks were one of the few species which polar bears respected and thought as close to themselves in spirit, a friendship with their clans were a clear indication of being proper bears to many. Only the history obsessed Clan Svartpels denied such notions and waged many a war against Volsungr, though mostly without any success.\n\nThat changed during the first bear unification as an alliance of Scyfling and Svartpels brutalized the clan and some even grew to believe this would lead to its extinction. Yet it endured, by using a method which others would consider too much, accepting back countless exiles without having to withstand a trial by combat. Even their current leader, the so called "Princess" Eira, was a former exile who during her exile travelled through Equestria and copied many of their ways. This has put both her and Clan Volsungr in opposition to us politically before even if they never showed it in the open and mostly seemed to ignore us, and now they march against us in war again."

Yet compared to all the meetings with the strange Vedinian cults and corrupt nobles, arrogant would-be warlords and bandits within what once they said to be was a duchy yet was now under Alexander Kemerskai and even working for the  "Talons" in the griffon colonies, this was the strangest. It wasn’t intimidating or conventionally scary. Rather the opposite. Instead of acting like mad beasts, trying to threaten or scare him or even openly mock him and call him nothing more than a beast, Clan Volsungr was nice. Absurdly nice even. The meeting occurred in a room within one of the fortresses of the clan. Furnished as if it was a minor palace within Equestria, Paw Wellington could only assume. The Volsungr bears apologized... Actually apologized that their "Princess" was being late. Furthermore they had offered various refreshments and nourishment. And such atmosphere was definitely far more terrifying than any attempts at threats by weaker creatures that he had experienced. For what sort of figure was this Eira, that she whipped a clan of mountain monster hunters into such submission?\n\nEira of Clan Volsungr was a rather strange figure. She was dressed in gold and red, with a substantial amount of jewellery and embroidery. Something which any proper bear would associate with weakness. After all, gold was a metal from which no weapon could be made and most fabrics were too weak to protect a warrior from enemy blows. Yet the Princess of Clan Volsungr was most definitely not weak physically, nearly being as large as Paw Wellington himself. Furthermore while she seemed to attempt to appear nice and welcoming, there was still frost and steel behind that façade.\n\nThe negotiations themselves were similar, very fluffy and nice looking from an outsider's perspective as Paw Wellington attempted to create a similar mask. However, with how misaligned the ideologies of the clans were, especially at the current point in time, reaching a consensus was difficult. And yet an agreement was reached, even if it was overwhelmingly vague and included countless various exceptions or situational duties and obligations as both former exiles tried to outmaneuver each other and ensure the best situation no matter what happened after. One thing was sure however, even if it went the worst way after this, Clan Scyfling would still be the leader and Volsungr the subordinate."

scyfling.61.d:0 "During previous plans of subjugation and destruction one thing was seen as almost certain in any engagement between Clan Scyfling and would be opponents from polar bear lands. That the forces under Paw Wellington would possess either technologically superior equipment or at least wouldn’t possess them in good enough numbers. This didn’t seem to be the case for Volsungr, which seemed to possess weapons similarly advanced and even something superior. Their armoured self propelled sleds were especially powerful weapons, being impossible to penetrate with most weapons. Only concentrated artillery or heavy anti-dragon rifles could shatter the advances of these weapons. And Volsungr seemed to possess something that could match these weapons in range and power too. For the first time in almost a decade, the position of power was somewhat flipped.\n\nAnd yet despite technological superiority, most of the weapons under the possession of Volsungr were rather limited in availability. The Clan itself was also lacking in numbers compared to the forces amassed by Paw Wellington at this point. And thus, even if it was slow and many of the more advanced and exotic contraptions had to be taken down with numbers, Volsungr was pushed into a defensive position.\n\nEventually any and all fortresses and outposts outside of the main Volungr hold were broken and shattered, the offensive weapons becoming more of a liability than an advantage. Of course, storming the mountains themselves and trying to engage the Volsungr within the caves and underground in which they thrived would have been suicidal. Yet, while the fortress itself was impossible to take for any force that wasn’t absolutely overwhelming, in this case it didn’t matter if the fortress was actually taken. It only mattered that Volsungr would fall. And thus any and all entrances were bombed until they collapsed inward. The Clan would perish in the holes they dug out themselves."

scyfling.62.d:0 "Clan Svartpels, the "Lords of Thunder" as they were known sometimes by fearful enemies, was a rather unique contradiction, at least if one tried to perceive them through a griffon and perhaps pony lens. For it was one of the most intellectual and scientifically aligned clans, at least before the Volsungr started welcoming outcasts back en masse, yet also one of the most warlike and reactionary when it came to advancements. The ritual of induction into the ranks of its panzerbjorn and leadership was the most brutal, as it included not just slaying beasts or winning a trial by combat, but as a proof of strength one was supposed to be struck by lightning and endure. Yet simultaneously, the same induction ceremony questioned the would-be warriors or leaders knowledge of bear history, tradition and what amounted to traditional sciences and crafts. Clan Svartpels was also heavily opposed to many ideas on change and advancement suggested by the younger generations, being the main source of bears cast out of the frozen north, yet when the proposer of such changes had proven their worth in combat, they would willingly and happily follow the changes. Such was the case when Paw Wellington managed to earn their friendship through a duel by defeating their leader, the great Thunder Lord Torben. After this Clan Svartpels assisted us in the unification of polar bear lands. Their support continued even through our most controversial and in retrospective absurd decisions. And yet now they stand against us.\n\nYet it’s not for reasons one would think. For Clan Svartpels and Torben turned against us not because they believe that we have broken our duties or committed some great sin. It seems that for one reason or the other, Torben and his entire clan believes that these actions were not of Paw Wellington and his clan, rather it’s either a changeling conspiracy of spreading lies or misinformation and shattering bear unity and causing conflict. In fact, they are so adamant in this belief that any bear that even wishes to approach a member of the clan is forged to engage in a duel as it’s widely believed that even if Changelings are able to masquerade as something comparing to our size, such form is not possible to maintain in combat."

After all it was the only clan which wasn’t subjugated through war. Rather, their allegiance in the bear unification wars were changed through but half a dozen duels as Paw Wellington fought and defeated Torben and the best panzerbjorn of the clan. Yet such a strategy wouldn’t be acceptable now. After all, anything that wasn’t a traditional battle could easily be perceived as trickery or actions of a collaborator. And thus Scyfling would have to fight far more skilled and physically capable Svartpels warriors with nothing more than mere axes.\n\nThe Scyfling warbands easily outnumbered their Svartpels counterparts, however as the battle continued unfolding, it was very clear that numbers didn’t matter in a battle like this. Only when Paw Wellington and Torben met in the middle of the great engagement and the Thunder Lord was defeated by the Despot did the battle turn to the side of Scyfling, and it was less an actual turn and more Torben rising to his feet with a great jolly laugh and screaming out the words of surrender as the entirety of the engagement and this duel was apparently good enough.\n\nThe battle was followed by a great feast as the ties of friendship and allegiance were reforged through exchange of foods and alcohol. Torben was of course overjoyed that Clan Scyfling and Paw Wellington had survived what he claimed must have been a changeling infiltration and spread of lies about the idea that Paw Wellington had accepted back the Mechanites and perhaps even worse scum. And that of course, with the two clans together again, something like this would not happen ever again."

scyfling.73.t:0 "Thunder Will Never Be Heard Again"
scyfling.73.d:0 "This was perhaps the hardest of things that Paw Wellington had done before. Maybe not in a literal sense, as while Clan Svartpels were indeed fearsome opponents, with our mind sets to destruction this war was not contested or ever even seemed to be turning towards the Lords of Thunder. What was hard for many, including bears, was having to destroy your friends and long time allies due to conflict over your own actions. Actions that you can’t take back and actions that they simply won’t accept. Yet it had to be done for a greater future, for a greater chance of polar bear survival as a state. And thus even if it was painful, it had to be done. So Scyfling deployed against Svartpels in full force.\n\nScyfling had technological, numerical and strategic superiority, but this didn’t mean that the Lords of Thunder went down quietly. They fought and bled and perished, yet crushed many a warband, often in spite of ranged weaponry which would have crushed any other force. And yet despite such victories, they couldn’t replace their losses, for there were so few true Svartpels yet there were many bears under Paw Wellington. And eventually, despite how much they raged and fought, their fortresses were crushed, their warriors and elders hunted down and whoever remained was pushed into the sea."
scyfling.73.a:0 "Only blizzard rules in the north now..."



svartpels.1.t:0 "The Only Explanation"
svartpels.1.d:0 "Torben, the Thunder Lord of Clan Svartpels paced back and forth in his chambers deep within a fortress of the farthest north, the howling of the icy winds outside echoing even there. It was all so confusing to him, everything that had happened. His friend, Paw Wellington could never have ordered something like it, that was for sure. Torben had known him for years now, fought by his side through everything, supported him on all his ideas thus far. But this act was so outrageous, so destructive that it was uncharacteristic even for the Despot. This could only have been the work of the eternal enemy of all bears, the changelings.\n\nIt all made sense. With all the strength and fortitude bears possessed, their western neighbors were scared, fearful for themselves, and so they sought to turn us amongst ourselves. They wanted to make us weak so they could strike when we least expected it. Well Torben had seen through their lies, and both him and Clan Svartpels would not fall so easily to their influence. They would bring honor, tradition and the true way of bears back to the land, to save them all.\n\nOf course this would be a difficult task. Clan Svartpels, despite having some of the strongest warriors of all clans, were low on numbers due to the first unification wars taking its toll. But even if the task would be arduous, he would see it through. If not for the clan, then at least for his fallen friend, in the name of all they had worked for so long ago."

svartpels.4.t:0 "A Visit to the Island"
svartpels.4.d:0 "With treason and deception afoot in the north, it is essential that before we can strike out against the other clans, we ensure that none of us can deceive and cause our downfall from within. Though they have been our vassal for much of Svartpels' recorded history, Clan Anker, located on the island in the middle of the bay has recently been rather distant, something that Thunder Lord Torben has taken suspiciously. To ensure the loyalty of the only major port we have, he has taken to visiting it personally and ensuring that no conspiracy has taken hold.\n\nThe journey was long and difficult, requiring treking across the windy forests, walking on the frozen ice, and rowing through the freezing waters. Once Torben and his panzerbjorn had arrived, they met a deserted dock, the remnants of the "navy" alone and unkept. This only grew the Thunder Lord's suspicions, and they slowly made their way towards the fortresses inland. When they had almost arrived at one of them, Torben was approached by a single bear, who he recognized as an elder of Clan Anker, and was immediately challenged to a duel.\n\nTorben, of course, immediately accepted. The battle was short but fierce, as the elder stood no chance against the strongest of Svartpels' warriors. But when they slowly got back up, bleeding and with quite a few shattered bones, they only nodded and screamed out into the winter snow that the Thunder Lord had truly returned. The rest of Clan Anker showed themselves almost immediately, and the elder explained that they had to ensure that Torben and his entourage were not really changelings, and that the lack of communication was them waiting for the real Torben to arrive. Torben was greatly amused and relieved that their closest vassal had remained true to the bear ways, and later that day they had a great feast to celebrate their continued bonds of master and subject."
svartpels.4.a:0 "We always knew we could trust in Clan Anker."

svartpels.5.t:0 "The Wesslandian Question"
svartpels.5.d:0 "Wesslandia is a strange land among the bears, a place where despite all the natural resources were given to the local clans, no lord or tyrant grew to rule the region and the bears in it. No, instead they have been stuck in a perpetual cycle of clans shattering and forming, always fighting for the best locations for fish or farming. The only thing these clans have had in common over the years is the use of a griffon servant caste, remnants from the avians to our east.\n\nBut now, it seems that things have changed. For because of the very culture and history that each of the three current Wesslandian clans of Falsen, Benkestok and Brodkorb lack, they have been able to create what is being called the "Triple Alliance", a united front against other clan leaders. They also seem to have new ambitions, as some say they desire to rule all bears much like our old friend Paw Wellington once did. While this clear break of bear tradition may just be the product of Paw's old ideas solidifying in other clans, something much more sinister may be at work. For if the changelings are behind this, then these clans must be destroyed before their influence can seep deeper into bear society..."
svartpels.5.a:0 "Their defiance will not be tolerated!"


svartpels.12.t:0 "Thunder and Lightning"
svartpels.12.d:0 "During the last war of unification, Clan Svartpels played a critical role in aiding Paw Wellington in the subjugation of Wesslandia, helping the tyrant outmaneuver and defeat the fractured warbands through a quick and easy conflict. While their allies were no longer here to assist, and Wesslandia was much more of a their with their unified force far outnumbering Svartpels' depleted numbers, Torben still rememebered exactly how to defeat them, and that knowledge was about to be put to good use. For in a long, protracted war, Wesslandia's numbers would surely overwhelm them, so time would be of the essence.\n\nSvartpels' warbands marched southward, led personally by Torben himself. Soon enough they met their opponents, armed with axes just as they were as tradition demanded for this engagement. The Wesslandians clearly outnumbered them, but Torben knew that didn't matter. For they had things that Wesslandia and their clans could never possess, the strength, conviction, and determination to see victory achieved. Each Svartpels warrior fought with the strength of ten bears, striking like thunder itself into the enemy lines. It was difficult, but the opponent's warbands eventually broke, leaving Torben the leader of this small engagement. But that was only the start.\n\nWhat followed was a series of incredibly quick attacks, as the panzerbjorn of Svartpels rushed to further defeat the Wesslandian warbands before they could regroup. Time and time again they struck, moving as fast as lightning across the forests and hills. Their armies thrown into complete disarray, the leaders of the clans were forced to submit and reaffirm their status as subjects in a mirror of the last unification war. Only this time, it was not Paw Wellington they renewed their loyalty to, but Thunder Lord Torben."
svartpels.12.a:0 "Numbers are no match for history and strength of will!"


svartpels.17.t:0 "What Must be Done"
svartpels.17.d:0 "It was incredibly saddening, to see an entire region such as Wesslandia fallen to the changelings' work. Oh, they denied it, of course, but what else could explain this sudden unity of clans, something that went against all of bear tradition? They had been tainted, and only one option remained for them. Their complete destruction for the sake of the true bears remaining.\n\nThe battles that followed in the forests of Wesslandia were bloody. Countless bears died, and corpses piled on each other as bear fought bear to the death. And while the Wesslandians may have had the numbers, they could never have the honor, the courage or the strength of Torben and his warriors, and inevitably were pushed back, their warbands getting destroyed. Their so-called unity fractured, as any changeling does when met with the power of a bear, with clans simply retreating to fend for themselves.\n\nWhat followed was a campaign of pure destruction, as Torben set out to finish what they had started. Their fortresses, the last remaining bastions of their control at this point had to fall. One by one they fell, their warriors and elders slaughtered without mercy, for none would be given for agents of changelings. Only the whelps and the cubs survived, deemed either too weak to be a threat or too young to have been corrupted. And by the end of it all, the bountiful Wesslandia was quiet once more, only the native beasts walking amongst the wilderness."
svartpels.17.a:0 "It may weigh heavily on us, but it is done."


svartpels.19.t:0 "Stemming the Flow"
svartpels.19.d:0 "Though we have discovered the changelings' obvious infiltration and subsequent sabatoge of bear unity, there is still a much more dangerous problem caused by them that could destroy bear tradition and society itself if left unchecked. And that is the endless waves of outcasts and exiles that have been pouring into the bear lands, the last act clearly created by foreign infiltration yet attributed to Paw Wellington. Nevertheless, these radicals have been constantly raiding our loyal and honorable bears and clans, and it is time to put a stop to them.\n\nNow that Wesslandia is secure, the opportunity has finally arisen to cut a major source of these traitors and outcasts, and those are the roads leading in from the east, in particular the lands of the griffons. By cutting and closing these roads inward, a major inlet has been stemmed, and already we have seen a decrease in the numbers of raids occuring daily. Though the territory we do not control yet still allows them entrance and the problem is not yet completely solved, soon enough these exiles will be gone from our lands and only true bears will remain."
svartpels.19.a:0 "These bears have no place here anymore!"

svartpels.20.t:0 "The Clans of War"
svartpels.20.d:0 "For the longest of times, Clan Svartpels has always respected the various clans that live in the desolate lands of Onlartir. They have not only respected and followed the traditional way of bear life and combat for the longest time, but also served as the bulwark against the yak and changeling invaders whenever they dared attempt to invade. The battles fought against them during the first unification wars were some of the most difficult Clan Svartpels had ever faced, and the three clans of Kane, Gotlung and Rozenkrantz are the pinnacle of bear militarism.\n\nHowever, with the recent chaos across all bear lands, Onlartir too has been affected by the changeling infiltration. They have completely forsaken the idea of bear unity that we had subjugated them for in the first place, instead talking about the strength of solitary clans under the protection of Clan Scyfling. It seems they have already forgotten their history of being subjugated by an alliance of ourselves and our old allies, and even more mysteriously this claimed protection from the Despot is nowhere to be seen. Meaning that while this could just be typical bear stubbornness, it could also be the work of the vile changelings..."
svartpels.20.a:0 "One way or another, the land will be ours."

svartpels.21.t:0 "United We Stand"
svartpels.21.d:0 "The great warriors of Clan Kane. The unbreakable fortresses of Clan Gotlung. The powerful shamans of Clan Rozenkrantz. All of them were formidable forces, who each had their own strength at which they excelled. But they still had their weaknesses as well, and those would be the cause of their defeat. For Clan Svartpels, as weakened as they were, was still a major clan and fully united in spirit, something that the clans of Onlartir could never be.\n\nClan Kane was the simplest. A traditional battle as demanded, a great charge by both sides as bears tore into one another. Those of Kane were great warriors indeed, matching Torben's own, and yet Svartpels still achieved victory once the Thunder Lord had defeated Grand Elder Ase on the field of battle. Gotlung was more difficult, with their great fortress of ice and steel standing proud and the clan warriors fighting tooth and nail. It was difficult, to say the absolute least in fighting through the impressive fortress, with all their defenses against a bear attack, yet their elders were soon forced to admit defeat as well. Yet it was Rozenkrantz, who was fought at Skybreaker Peak that was without a doubt the hardest to subdue. The mountain winds and beasts were already dangerous to an ursine on their own, and the warriors and shamans seemed to be blessed by the northern winds themselves. The Shaman Lord himself was without a doubt the most difficult of the leaders to subdue, yet Torben still emerged victorious. And by the end of the battles, all three clans had sworn their new loyalty as subjects to the Thunder Lord and Clan Svartpels, and this time they would not be influenced by infiltrators so easily."
svartpels.21.a:0 "And divided they fell."

svartpels.22.t:0 "Fall of the Lords"
svartpels.22.d:0 "Due to their proximity to the changeling hives, it should have been expected that the clans of Onlartir would have been the first to be turned. And yet when he first heard the claims that they were under the protection of Clan Scyfling, Torben had for the briefest moment held out hope that Clan Scyfling was still strong. But when his panzerbjorn returned, they brought back no proof of such claims. Their lies were hollow, a sure sign of their one true enemy. And so the three clans of Onlartir would have to fall as well.\n\nClan Kane was the first to fall. Though they admittedly fought well and hard against us, Svartpels was determined to let no bear stand in the way of unity. Clan Gotlung was next, their great fortress being the only real obstacle from their destruction. Though many died taking it, in the end it only served as their resting place for all the warriors who once lived there. As for Clan Rozenkrantz, they may have had the winter winds on their side, but Torben and his warriors still had a stronger spirit. And by the time it was said and done, all that was left of their clans were the blood-soaked battlegrounds of Kane, the red-splattered walls of Gotlung, and the howling frozen spirit and winter lights atop Skybreaker Peak."
svartpels.22.a:0 "No one shall stop our cause."


svartpels.24.t:0 "An Ancient Rival"
svartpels.24.d:0 "Since almost the dawn of Clan Svartpels itself, we have always been fierce rivals with the mountainous Clan Volsungr. Their way of living and fighting is odd, relying on beast-slaying Nanooks instead of traditional warriors and living in mountains more fit for diamond dogs than bears. And yet their vast amounts of Starsteel armor and weapons surpassed all other clans', and their ritualized wars with our kin in spirit to the south, the Yaks showed their worth as true bears. It was thus with great sadness that we learned during the last unification wars that the result of our and Scyfling's conflict with them was almost complete extinction.\n\nIn an effort to survive, though, Clan Volsungr went too far in what they did. Accepting back exiles from beyond the polar bear lands, not forcing them to win a trial by combat... It was no wonder that they were corrupted and tainted by Equestrian influence into what they are today. Volsungr is not tainted by the far-reaching changeling influence, but the so-called Princess Eira has taken something far worse, something that may have made them beyond saving..."
svartpels.24.a:0 "We will not allow this disease to spread any further!"

svartpels.25.t:0 "Submission of Harmony"
svartpels.25.d:0 "Forcing the bears of Clan Volsungr to submit would be a difficult task, that was for certain. For while they were certainly tainted by the southern Equestrians, they had self-propelled armored sleds and long range weaponry reminiscent of Paw Wellington's artillery. And while their ideals were certainly weak and against all bears stood for, no one could deny their conviction for them. A last remnant of their old clan ways, back when they were much more like Svartpels in having strong unshakable beliefs.\n\nIn terms of terrain and technology, Volsungr certainly had the advantage. Their Nanooks were much more used to fighting on the mountainous terrain of the Volsungr territory than our own, and at first even our great warriors struggled to push southward. As both forces of warbands clashed ferociously, Torben saw that spark, that last remaining spirit of the old clan, and that gave him hope that maybe, Volsungr was not yet lost. So, when they had finally made it to the main Volsungr fortress, Torben challenged Princess Eira to a traditional bear duel, to prove the supremacy of Svartpels' beliefs over hers.\n\nEira emerged from the entrance of the mountain clad in gold and fabric, something which Torben saw as the very definition of everything wrong with the Clan. It was a symbol of their weakness, the very essence of their fall from grace. And yet in the duel, Eira proved herself no whelp as she fought the Thunder Lord almost to a standstill. Almost. In the end, Torben emerged the victor, with Eira defeated. And symbolically shedding the various trivialities she wore, Eira and the rest of Clan Volsungr present swore their loyalty to Torben, honoring the ancient system of clans and showing that their ancient spirit still lived on."
svartpels.25.a:0 "They have finally broken their own chains."


svartpels.30.t:0 "Weakness Shattered"
svartpels.30.d:0 "It was something that, in hindsight, was a long time coming for Clan Volsungr. The obvious outcome of a clan who blindly lets any bear back in a desperate attempt for survival, without caring for the consequences. They were infected with foreign influence long before the changelings ever arrived, and it was time to put a stop to this disgusting disease of weakness. Harmony would be shattered, as would all those who had brought such a perversive ideology here.\n\nThe clan did not go down easily. As one could suspect, they fought with all their might to keep their new ideals, as tainted as they were. The armored sleds and long range weaponry they possessed made things difficult, but the panzerbjorn of Clan Svartpels would not be deterred. Bit by bit, step by step, bear by bear, they pushed ever onward, until the Volsungr had no more ground left to give. Even when Torben himself was going through their great mountain caves to root out the last bastions, they fought with reckless abandon in their natural home, having the clear advantage. Torben himself took major injuries, suffering a few cracked ribs and bleeding by the end of it.\n\nBut their ideology proved their downfall, and the spirit of Svartpels was unbreakable. As the sun set over the bear lands, the Thunder Lord emerged from the caves, having ordered any and all records, artwork, anything that could be even possibly related to their new beliefs burned and destroyed. Volsungr's only history remaining would be their proud warrior one, as it should be. Harmony had died in the far north, and there would be no resurrecting it."
svartpels.30.a:0 "The natural order will be maintained, no matter the cost."

svartpels.31.t:0 "A Friend in Chaos"
svartpels.31.d:0 "Clan Scyfling has long been a close friend of ours. This has been the case since even before the first unification wars, when the despot Paw Wellington, new leader of the clan had beaten Torben himeself in a traditional duel, thus proving his strength and showing us the superiority of his ideals of unity. Ever since that glorious day, we have fought side-by-side with our greatest allies, aiding them time and time again in both their battles and in ruling over all bears. We supported them in every decision, even a few controversial ones, for as Clan Scyfling said they were blessed by their All-Father and kept law and order across the land.\n\nThat time, though, has come to an end. For the recent acts of the changelings has seemed to hit Clan Scylfing the hardest, as they have collapsed and been reduced to countless infighting within their lands. There has been no sign of Paw Wellington has of yet, and though we can only hope that our friends are still fighting somewhere in there, it is possible that we might have been too late..."
svartpels.31.a:0 "Is there anything left to save?"

svartpels.32.t:0 "A Rescue of Allies"
svartpels.32.d:0 "With the situation growing more dire by the second, Torben knew he had to act quickly to save what was left. Waiting any longer could doom whatever bears left who were loyal to Paw Wellington and by extension bear unity. So, gathering the best panzerbjorn of his entire clan into a great warband, he personally led the charge deep into Clan Scyfling territory, defeating any bears who fought them along the way. A few willingly joined the Thunder Lord remembering the old friends of the Despot, but many others refused to go down without a fight. At the very least, there was no changelings here anymore, as all the warriors beaten in combat were proven to truly be bears, even if they had been swayed by the changeling corruption.\n\nConflict became especially fierce as they reached the capital of Mathair Fearainn, where the majority of Clan Scyfling's fortresses lay. Some of Paw's best panzerbjorn, or at least what was his best panzerbjorn had fought with all their might to keep Torben out from Paw's stronghold. It was sobering to see that even their best was tainted by Chrysalis' work, and for a brief moment Torben was worried that Paw himself might have fallen. Fortunately as he broke into his room, he found his old friend just like his old self, albeit a bit strangely subdued. It was nothing a great post-victory feast could not handle, of course, though according to the ancient rules of the ursine race, since Clan Svartpels had been the one to save Clan Scyfling, they would be the dominant ones in leadership now."
svartpels.32.a:0 "To the bonds of friendship saved!"

svartpels.39.t:0 "The Heaviest of Burdens"
svartpels.39.d:0 "It was, without a doubt, the hardest thing that Torben had ever done. Perhaps not in a literal sense, as Clan Scyfling was too busy tearing themselves apart to be of much threat to Clan Svartpels. No, what was painful to all, even bears, was having to destroy your old friends, your greatest of allies. They did not have a choice, as there was already nothing left to save. Only those who had to be destroyed for the future, for the survival of all bears. And so, the warbands were ordered to not stop until all of Clan Scyfling was no more.\n\nIt was pathetically easy, which may have made the action all the worse. For while Scyfling was once one of the strongest clans, with a strong spirit behind a strong despot, now they were reduced to nothing but pointless infighting. They still fought with the might of true bears, of course, and they died like true warriors. Even when it was all said and done, the ice running red with blood, the Thunder Lord could not be prouder of those he once called friends. They died much as they lived, as some of the strongest panzerbjorn in all the land, and no amount of changeling conspiracy would ever change that. And so, Torben knew what he had to do.\n\nFor many days and many nights he and his clan members worked, but in the end it was all worth it. A large monument, made of ice and stone for their fallen friends. It was as strong as any bear fortress, and on it was the names of the greatest warriors of Clan Scyfling, including Paw Wellington himself who they never found the body of. And thus a moment of silence was given as they all mourned.\n\nHad Torben done it? Yes. But what did it cost?"
svartpels.39.a:0 "...Everything..."



volsungr.1.t:0 "The Task Ahead"
volsungr.1.d:0 "Chaos. Destruction. Death.\n\nAs Princess Eira watched the many bears of Clan Volsungr make ready for battle, her only thoughts were about the task ahead of them all. It would be difficult, that much was for sure. Much like the Despot did before them, Clan Volsungr would have to demonstrate their strength, their fortitude and their conviction if they were to sway the other clans into accepting their rule. But Eira would see it through, she had to see it through if they were to save the bears from themselves and each other, and rule united as leaders and not subjugators.\n\nAnd yet despite her determination to see things through, Eira couldn't help but wonder if there had been a different path. Could she have convinced Paw Wellington to see things differently? Could she have saved her kind without the need for this new time of bloodshed? Or were acts of superiority the only method that other clans understood? Princess Eira did not know, but those questions were in the past. Now, she needed to look towards the future."
volsungr.1.a:0 "For a new path of all bears!"

volsungr.2.t:0 "Problems Within the Holds"
volsungr.2.d:0 "While the other clans continue to clash in the frozen north, a serious issue has developed in Clan Volsungr itself. For while he no longer holds control over the polar bears, Paw Wellington's last action of opening the borders to the former exiles has caused heated debate and conflict between the elders and young ones in the clan. It is clear that if we are to march and unite the bears once more, Princess Eira must take a side and solve this issue before it spirals out of control.\n\nOn one paw, the younger bears want the clan to accept all bears who are returning to the land. Their numbers will be necessary to subdue the other clans, they say, and thus any aid offered should be taken. In the spirit of friendship, we must be accepting of all the exiles, and keep the borders open.\n\nOn the other paw, the elders of the clan wish to limit the number of exiles we accept into Clan Volsungr. While the clan is largely exiles at this point now, with the Princess being one herself, there is a reason the others were not let back in before. Not all of them are as harmonious as the clan, and some were expelled for crimes even many of the clan abhor. Though the borders should not be closed completely, they must still only allow those trustworthy to enter."
volsungr.2.a:0 "But what to choose?"

volsungr.3.t:0 "Wave of Volunteers"
volsungr.3.d:0 "With the borders open, thousands of polar bears have recently streamed into the clan, coming from a wide variety of places. While the vast majority of them have agreed to aid us in the unification of the polar bear lands, there are quite a few that even the younger members of the clan consider to have... suspicious backgrounds. Though there has been no issues of violence yet, it is clear these newcomers do not all share the principles of friendship and harmony. Though we will allow them to fight for the clan, we should also keep a close watch on these exiles."
volsungr.3.a:0 "Let us hope this was not a mistake..."

volsungr.4.t:0 "Guarding the Gates"
volsungr.4.d:0 "Over the past days, many bears have come to our clan seeking to join us from exile. Though there are many that the elders deemed fit and welcome to enter, there were still many others that were denied and forced to turn back to whatever land they came from. Whether they were deemed too insane, too brutal or simply against the principles of harmony, all of them would not have found a place in Clan Volsungr. Perhaps it was for the best that we rejected these polar bears, for now our clan is more united in purpose than ever before."
volsungr.4.a:0 "This was the right decision."

volsungr.5.t:0 "The Triple Alliance"
volsungr.5.d:0 "Wesslandia, the region to the north has always been the most normal to other creatures, making it the strangest for bears. The land is dense with forest and filled with game and berries, fertile enough to grow tubers and other such food. The animals there are standard in the sense to griffons or ponies, instead of the magical beasts standard in the rest of the land. Even its long coastline is ripe with fish, seals and other such creatures. Yet despite all these resources at their disposal, no clan ever became leader of the region to assert dominance over the foods and other clans. Even facing Nova Griffonian invasion the clans did not unify, instead reclaiming land and enslaving the griffons who had arrived.\n\nThis has all changed though, as the three current clans of Falsen, Benkestok and Brodkorb, products of a seemingly endless cycle of clans rising and shattering, have forged an alliance of equals. While something like this has never been seen before by the clans, it may be a result of their similar traditions and use of griffon servants. Though their ability to cooperate as equals is admirable, the claims that the "Triple Alliance" as it was now being referred to was seeking to usurp power over the bears for themselves have many in the clan worried and believing that conflict is the only option."
volsungr.5.a:0 "How do we deal with this?"

volsungr.6.t:0 "Tripartite Diplomacy"
volsungr.6.d:0 "The clan leaders and Princess Eira had agreed to meet on the edge of the forest north of the mountains of Clan Volsungr, the general border that separated their controlled territory from the Wesslandians. The arrival of both delegations were relatively uneventful, something that gave hope to the Princess and her companions. The fact that they had not used any grand shows of force or great threats against them usually used to intimidate an enemy clan into submission in such talks meant that they clearly wanted to speak on an equal footing.\n\nThe negotiations were long, and though it was mostly uneventful and civilized and most arguments were talked down through words, there was still a fair bit of fights and violence, with some Volsungrians leaving with a few broken ribs. The demands of the Wesslandians were small, only involving some basic concepts for future agricultural and economic plans of all things. Perhaps the rumors of them wanting dominion over all bears were just that, or perhaps the fear of being surrounded by other clans had driven them to open their minds. The end result is the same; the clans of Wesslandia have submitted to our ideals and our protection."
volsungr.6.a:0 "At least they were reasonable."


volsungr.20.t:0 "Three on One"
volsungr.20.d:0 "While Paw Wellington had defeated the clans of Wesslandia once before, Clan Volsungr would not be able to replicate the tactics of the despot to defeat the clans to the north in battle. They simply did not have the numerical advantage to afford such an attack, especially against the combined might of the "Triple Alliance". It was also clear that they would unable to win a long drawn-out conflict, so in typical bear tradition a large show of overwhelming force and victory would be needed to cow them into submission.\n\nOur forces met the three clans and their warbands at the river, a natural border and battlefield for the fight. Though our warriors were clad in our starsteel armor and fought valiantly, Wesslandia simply had more numbers and began forcing Volsungr on the defensive. They crossed the river and the forests, making it all the way to the foot of the mountains.\n\nThen the Nanooks arrived, coming down the mountainside to reinforce the remaining warbands. Having decades of experience fighting monsters far more terrifying than a mere ursine, they proved to turn the tide as Clan Volsungr fought with renewed vigor. Now it was Wesslandia's turn to be pushed back, through the forest and across the river until they finally surrendered. Realizing that the conflict was all but over now, the clan leaders met with Eira soon after to lay down their weapons and admit their status as subjects one more, but this time under a new master."

volsungr.26.t:0 "Duel of Thunder"
volsungr.26.d:0 "The journey up north to Clan Svartpels was long and difficult. The land was cold and unforgiving, even for the polar bears, and to reach the clan itself one had to cross many mountains, hills and forests. And before they could even enter the fortresses of ice, Princess Eira and her entourage were all forced to duel panzerbjorn of Clan Svartpels just to prove their identity as bears. Eira had expected this, however, and had only taken along the strongest and seasoned elders to accompany her. As soon as they had defeated the panzerbjorn and caught the attention of the Thunder Lord Torben himself, Princess Eira immediately challenged the clan leader to a duel.\n\nThe fight that followed was long and enthralling, drawing many from the clan to watch as the two leaders battled to assert dominance over the other. Though Torben was the strongest of the clan, having only been beaten once by Paw Wellington before, Eira was almost just as powerful and tactical. Even so, it was only by a matter of sheer luck that the Princess had managed to claim victory, exploiting the Thunder Lord's over-aggressiveness. And when Torben rose back to his paws, his expression was one of grudging respect as both he and Clan Svartpels swore allegiance to Princess Eira, the new unifier of the clans."

volsungr.29.t:0 "Continuing the Push"
volsungr.29.d:0 "As the last bear left the room of Princess Eira, she let herself sit back in an icy chair and relax, tired of dealing with today's issues. From sunrise to sunset, she had been met with a plethora of bears in the clan, ranging from warriors to elders asking why they were continuing to fight against the remaining clans. Arguments had ranged from simply wanting more time to recover to wondering why we were wasting time on bears that were clearly unharmonic. That they were more trouble then they were worth, and that Clan Volsungr should just focus on their own bears now that their situation was secure.\n\nFor every single visitor, Eira made it clear that this decision was not up for debate. The new path of polar bear would be for all of them, not just for those in the clan. Not only that, but the longer they remained fragmented the weaker they would become, and the greater the chance that some foreigners would take the opportunity to invade. A few of the more stubborn bears she had to threaten to get them to comply, but by the end of it everybear that left was either satisfied or unwilling to go against the Princess. They were ready to march once more, and finish what they had started."
volsungr.29.a:0 "We will not leave anybear behind."

volsungr.30.t:0 "Tyrants to the West"
volsungr.30.d:0 "Clan Scyfling, the former head clan of the polar bears, has long been led by the Despot known as Paw Wellington. They were the first to unite the clans into one, forcing all others into submission and taking a place of superiority and domination as the undisputed masters of the lands. They even imagined themselves as being blessed by divine favour, an aspect of their religiosity deeply embedded in the clan itself. Paw Wellington had continued to ignore the wishes of the other clans during his rule, something that had inevitably led to the situation occuring now.\n\nHowever, for all their faults, the achievements that Clan Scyfling have accomplished are undeniable. For even with all their mistakes in doing so, the Despot was the first to finally unite bears under a single banner. His expertise from other races is unparalleled in all the clans, especially in warfare, and both him and Clan Scyfling valued law and order not just in their lands, but all across the country. Without his leadership, the polar bears may have very well been conquered or subjugated by another race such as the changelings long before now."
volsungr.30.a:0 "But can they listen to reason?"

volsungr.31.t:0 "Rivals of the North"
volsungr.31.d:0 "Clan Svartpels, the "Lords of Thunder" has long been an enemy of Clan Volsungr. For many years, long before the clans were united, they waged many wars against us in an attempt to destroy what they saw as disgraceful and dishonorable to ursine tradition. While we had beaten them back time and time again, when Svartpels gained Scyfling as an ally in the unification campaign Volsungr suffered immensely as a result of the brutalization that followed. The clan had teetered on the brink of destruction, only narrowing saving itself by allowing the mass return of exiles such as Princess Eira herself which had further ostracized Volsungr from Svartpels.\n\nAnd yet for all its brutality, Clan Svartpels is still considered to be one of the most intellectual and scientifically advanced clans due to its seemingly contradictory stances on things. The clan itself is incredibly brutal and warlike, yet its leaders are cultured in both bear history and tradition. They opposed change and advancement when suggested, yet was one of Paw Wellington's most loyal supporters when he led the polar bear lands. And even with all their focus on the strength of a creature, they enjoyed the company of the penguins of all races.\n\nBut now it seems that they have descended into paranoia. For in the far north, they separated from the Despot in the first place believing that all the recent problems have been solely the cause of changeling infiltrators. Any bear that seeks to get close to the clan must fight a duel to prove their identity as a bear, something that may prove troublesome to overcome."
volsungr.31.a:0 "An enigmatic situation..."

volsungr.32.t:0 "The Princess and the Despot"
volsungr.32.d:0 "Princess Eira approached Clan Scyfling for negotiations expecting many things. A spiteful despot. A religious fanatic. A raging ursine. A clan willing to do whatever it takes to regain control. She had entered the negotiations with a mask of frost and steel, determined not to show weakness to the despot.\n\nWhat Eira had gotten, however, was absolutely nothing like what she had expected. She arrived at his fortress of ice with little trouble, waiting within while the Despot finished some necessary duties of his. While she waited, Eira could not help but notice the large statue of a bear-like beast, something that almost every warrior of Clan Scyfling paid respects to as they passed. And the clan members, they all walked with such purpose, with order unlike the chaos that usually described the business in other tribes. The despot certainly had done his work here, that was for sure.\n\nWhen it finally came time to speak with him, the meeting was very different from what she had imagined as well. Paw Wellington was a former exile like herself, and it was clear that his experiences has molded him just as they had molded her. And just like her, he was not going to give up those ideas and beliefs easily. The talks were long and arduous, as the two bears fought a battle of words and minds attempting to gain the upper paw on the other. Wellington was no fool, and he was much more experienced in such tactics than Eira was. And yet, with Clan Volsungr itself in a much stronger position than Clan Scyfling, there was only so much he could do. Not only that, but as the talks continued he seemed to slowly lose the will to continue, his mind almost drifting off elsewhere. By the time Eira and the Volsungrians has exited the fortress of ice and stone, it was clear that while many concessions had been made, it was no longer Scyfling in lead, but Volsungr."
volsungr.32.a:0 "Words only go so far without the strength to back them."


volsungr.35.t:0 "No Compromise"
volsungr.35.d:0 "Despite the recent chaos, Clan Scyfling still remained one of the most powerful clans militarily. They of course had they Despot himself, Paw Wellington to lead them, as well as subjects in the clans of Onlartir. However, they were also lacking one critical thing, and that was unity. With Paw Wellington's failure to keep order, tensions between Scyfling and the south were at an all-time high, and their cooperation was at a breaking point.\n\nThe two armies of warbands met in the hills close to the border with Volsungr's territory, led by the Despot and the Princess respectively. Their numbers were close to equal, and though Clan Volsungr had their warriors of starsteel, Clan Scyfling still possessed great weapons of death, a force of artillery. At first, the battle seemed to sway towards Paw Wellington, as many bears of Volsungr fell to the great power and might of the artillery shells and tactics of the Despot. But cracks slowly began to appear in the enemy, as cooperation between the clans of Scyfling and Onlartir were weak. At one point close to an entire warband was destroyed by friendly fire from their own shells. Princess Eira, seeing this weakness took advantage immediately, creating unified assaults and breakthroughs through their lines, causing immense disarray. Their forces quickly starting to dwindle, they were forced to retreat.\n\nThis outcome continued in several other battles across the polar bear lands, as Paw Wellington's warbands were continuously pushed back simply from a lack of unity and command, something that our own armies possessed. The effect was almost immediate, as after it was clear they were on the losing side the various clans of Onlartir broke off from Clan Scyfling, instead surrendering to Clan Volsungr. The Despot, realizing that all was lost at this point, gave up soon after, leaving the entire west of ursine lands subdued in a single claw swipe."
volsungr.35.a:0 "The Despot has been defeated!"

volsungr.36.t:0 "The Battle of Raumelf River"
volsungr.36.d:0 "The warbands of Volsungr and Svartpels met on Raumelf River, the natural border that separated Clan Svartpels' territory from the rest of the bear lands. Due to their suspicion against all other bears due to the recent chaos and suspecting changeling intrusion, it was clear that they would not be satisfied by anything other than a traditional battle and victory. Therefore, both sides were outfitted with nothing more than mere axes, weapons that Torben's clan were much more skilled in using. And even with Volsungr's clear numerical advantage, it was clear from the start of the battle that numbers didn't matter here, only skill, strength and conviction.\n\nIt was not over in any short amount of time. Quite the opposite in fact. Over the course of an entire week, bears fought each other head on, some resorting to their bare claws on the battlefield. It was a long stalemate as neither clan could gain the upper paw, until finally on the seventh day things changed. Princess Eira herself and the rest of the elders personally came onto the frontlines, as did Thunder Lord Torben and his panzerbjorn. As fighting continued to rage all around them, Eira barely managed to defeat Torben in battle, which truly marked the end of the conflict as the Thunder Lord stood back up and gave a single nod before announcing his surrender. Clan Volsungr had apparently proven themselves worthy, as soon after Clan Svartpels affirmed their loyalty to the Princess just as they had to Paw Wellington years ago."
volsungr.36.a:0 "Success is the best show of strength!"


volsungr.39.t:0 "Victory at Last"
volsungr.39.d:0 "It was done. Though they were faced by obstacle after obstacle, Princess Eira had united the clans once more. From north to south, east to west, all acknowledged Eira and Harmony as the leader and path of all bears. The strength of their beliefs was proven without a doubt, and the time of chaos had come to an end.\n\nBut there is no time to rest on our victories. True strength is proven through actions, not words, and so we shall carry out what we have promised we shall do. All clans will have a say in the future, a united future of harmony and unity. For how apart we may fall, together we will overcome anything that dares block our way."
volsungr.39.a:0 "For the new future!"



volsungrb.1.t:0 "A Unique Situation"
volsungrb.1.d:0 "Compromise was not something that was common or ever normal among ursines. Ideas had to be fought for to the letter, and only one would be proven superior. Yes, the loser did usually keep a few of their old ideas to mesh with the new, but the victors never felt any need to cater to the defeated. After all why would anybear want to adopt something that was proven inferior?\n\nOur situation, on the other paw, is nothing close to the norm of bearkind. Our negotiations with other clans has saved lives and given us moral superiority, for what that matters, but it also has put us on a much more fragile footing compared to those other clans. They are not kept under our banner through force or threat or subjugation, but simply by their own free will and word. And that means we will have to tread carefully and keep them satisfied if we are to keep bearkind together. But though the next few days will be... difficult, to say the least, we will be stronger for it in the end."
volsungrb.1.a:0 "Actions and understanding are the binds of unity, not force."

volsungrb.2.t:0 "The First Princess"
volsungrb.2.d:0 "The great meeting hall in Mathair Fearainn had been repurposed for the great event today. Bears of all clans had traveled to Clan Scyfling's great home to witness what was unprecedented in all the written history of bearkind. For today the first coronation of the Polar Princess was to take place, with the consent of all the major clan leaders.\n\nAfter short deliberation, Eira had chosen to make the ceremony short and to the point, as to keep at least some part of bear tradition within. It consisted of nothing more than an oath in front of the ursines to work with and respect the rights of each clan, and the crowning itself. It was a simple ring shape reinforced with starsteel, both regal and able to bash a creature's head in, which was also intentional.\n\nThe unique relationship between the Princess and her subjects, though, was no better demonstrated than at the very end. For when it came time to bow, while the masses of warriors did so, Thunder Lord Torben and Paw Wellington did not. She may have been the unifier, but they were not subjects. As long as Eira held their loyalty, the bears would prosper. But if she went against them at a inopportune time... the consequences could be far worse than what happened to the Despot."
volsungrb.2.a:0 "To the Princess of Polar Bears!"

volsungrb.3.t:0 "A Union of Grace and Order"
volsungrb.3.d:0 "It was not convincing Paw Wellington to accept Princess Eira's proposal that was difficult. No, it was actually finding him in the first place that proved to cause the most trouble. No one in Clan Scyfling had seen him in days, and his former quarters left no evidence as to where he might have gone. Pseudo-search parties were formed to find him immediately, with Eira herself leading them.\n\nHe was found in an odd place, a lone fortress near the edge that separated the east and west of Key Lake. A single massive statue, even larger than the one of the great bear-like figure that was also within the fortresses of Clan Scyfling made up the centerpiece of the area. Paw Wellington was in odd priestly robes, seemingly in prayer to the beast in front of him. When he first saw Eira he seemed initially hostile, but once she made clear her intent to propose to him, he grudgingly accepted. Why remained a mystery to all but Paw himself, but that didn't matter to Eira. The only thing that did was that he accepted.\n\nThe ceremony was set up by members of both Clan Volsungr and Clan Scyfling in Mathair Fearainn, in front of the great All-Father. It was very orderly and tradition, and a priest that Paw had selected himself ordained them as husband and wife. At his suggestion, Eira officially renamed herself to something more similar to the Despot, eventually settling on Maw Wellington. And so all the polar bears clapped respectfully at the new pair of royals, as Princess and Prince."
volsungrb.3.a:0 "To the Princess and her new consort!"

volsungrb.4.t:0 "A Union of Grace and Force"
volsungrb.4.d:0 "Convincing Torben of going along with the marriage was no easy task. Many of Clan Svartpels saw the proposal as purely something that came from the south and from the pony lands, and like everything with that title they regarded it with immense suspicion and skepticism. Only after a promise of it being done in nature as a compromise, as well as holding a great afterparty involving large amounts of traditional bear activities did the Thunder Lord finally accept her proposal.\n\nThe marriage itself was held in Svartpels' territory far north, on a clearing inside a great snowy forest. The ceremony itself was short and simple, as a preciding bear asked them to recite their vows and then proclaimed them partners for life. Torben was then crowned as the new Prince of the Polar Bears, as elders from all clans expressed their approval through various roars and pounding of weapons. Perhaps not a picture perfect storybook ending, but it was close enough.\n\nAfterward, just as promised, the caskets of alcohol were opened and a massive party ensured. Bears drank, ate, and fought great duels as Torben watched and laughed through it all. By the time the moon was rising over the horizon, not a single ursine barring the Princess herself present was in any coherent state. Even inebriated, Torben still was determined for the final act, wrestling a Turabaq to the ground. And at midnight on the dot, he rose from the hastily built arena, bleeding and battered, but victorious over the monster, as all polar bears chanted their approval and respect to the new Prince."
volsungrb.4.a:0 "To the Princess and her new consort!"

volsungrb.5.t:0 "The Waiting Game"
volsungrb.5.d:0 "Patience was not a natural trait of most ursines. Polar bears were doers, they preferred to take action instead of waiting for something to happen or an opportunity to present itself. They made their own opportunities, seized the initiative, took chances and lived with both their victories and their defeats. It was just how bear society had worked for millenia.\n\nLove did not work the same way. You could not force yourself to love someone else, at least not really. It came naturally, like a butterfly landing on a branch. Yes, you could seek it out, but in the end it was up to fate whether you would find your partner or not. And that was what marriage was all about, even in fantasy, it was about two creatures loving each other no matter what the cost. Princess Cadence and by extension the Crystal Empire did it, and so Princess Eira would follow in her pawsteps... or rather hoofsteps. She would build her nation like theirs, in preparation for when the time would come.\n\nHopefully her true love would appear one day. He would be her true Prince, and they would have a wonderful heir to raise. But it was quite possible that he would never come, and she would be left alone for the rest of her days. Eira would still find a heir of course, somebear to take her place. The nation was more important than her daydreams of a storybook ending. Yet she could still hold out hope that out there, someplace in the world, a bear meant for her was coming.\n\nAll she could do now was wait."
volsungrb.5.a:0 "Wait, and see what the future brings."


volsungrb.7.t:0 "The Three Principles"
volsungrb.7.d:0 "Paw Wellington's absence has continued to the confusion of the rest of ursinekind, leaving the leadership of the clan to the Assembly and causing some to assume that a terrible fate has befallen upon him. However, the clan members insist that he is still alive and well, just retracted from public life. This seems to have been proved as a package addressed to Princess Eira herself has come straight from Paw Wellington via messenger, which contained a simple book and a request to allow the Assembly to implement the points within it.\n\nThe book was a fairly well-known one, particularly in Griffonia. It was "The Three Principles", written by Alexander Kemerskai which outlined his goals of Liberty, Democracy and Prosperity, as well as the other ideals of the Griffonian Republic. It seemed to be Paw's personal copy of it, as many phrases and parts of it were either crossed out or circled, and little notes between the lines were commonplace. Bolded ones included the phrases "law and order", "necessary leadership", "Father of the Republic", and "constitution". Not all of the contents Eira agreed with, of course, but it was certainly something to think about. Perhaps she would give the Scyfling Assembly the opportunity Paw had asked for..."
volsungrb.7.a:0 "Quite an intriguing read."

volsungrb.8.t:0 "The Pyramid"
volsungrb.8.d:0 "The latest work and idea of Thunder Lord Torben, "The Pyramid" can be described as many things. An ideology. A political system. An extension of the clan caste system that the polar bears have had for centuries. In simple terms, it is the idea that due to the ancient nature of polar bear society and therefore the superiority of the system, we are justified in leading and bring that harmonic way of life to others. It explains that the idea of a hierarchy is still harmonic as long as the bears who lead it are.\n\nWhile much of this is just the old ideals of Clan Svartpels recreated, there is a surprising new addition to the system. It places a new emphasis on inter-caste cooperation and the importance of still treating those lower on the pyramid right. That while those weaker and lower should have no ability to influence important things like leadership and government, they are still an important part of bear society and that it is the duty of those stronger to care and protect them. It is the strangest blend of harmony and clan values possible, and yet some cannot help but be attracted by the concept."
volsungrb.8.a:0 "An interesting system, but can it work?"

volsungrb.9.t:0 "Harmony in Nature"
volsungrb.9.d:0 "Tryvge of Clan Volsungr was unsure if he was suited for the task ahead of him. It was a strange feeling that he was not used to, as back in the mountain holds he was a respected elder and seasoned warrior, well-versed in both fighting the magical beasts that frequently came close to the clan and in the ideals of harmony that he, along with Princess Eira herself and others had brought many years ago. In terms of strength and mental will, he was certainly one of the best.\n\nWhat he was not prepared for, though, was working with bears of entirely different clans, all of whom had no obligation to agree with anything.\n\nJust a few days prior Princess Eira had created, with the agreement of both Paw Wellington and Thunder Lord Torben, the Royal Environmental Agency. Vested with the full authority to enforce any measures necessary to ensure the safety and continued survival of nature, it was up to a small group of himself and a few other bears, paw-picked by their clan leaders to make such decisions. Tryvge was certain of his own ability to be on this council, but was he was not certain of was whether the other bears would be so wise in these regards, or even care.\n\nBut at the very least, he would try. "Silence!" he roared to the rest present, who had already started threatening each other with battleaxes within the first five minutes of entering their frozen room. They all immediately shut up, which was good; at least they respected his authority as the head of the agency. "The Princess has given us this position to save nature, not to fight! Now, I believe our first order of business should be to go through the records of Turabaqs provided by Clan Svartpels to see what environment suits it best! All in agreement?"\n\nThe bears looked at each other, all before slowly nodding and slamming the butts of their axes on the floor hard enough to crack the ice beneath them.\n\nPerhaps it would not be so hard after all."
volsungrb.9.a:0 "They will ensure our lands survive the modern era."

volsungrb.10.t:0 "Return of the Monsters"
volsungrb.10.d:0 "As Tryvge surveyed the forests of snow before him, he couldn't help but feel that something was different from before. Perhaps it was the way the trees shifted in the wind. Or maybe the beautiful icicles that were hanging from the branches and rocks, shining under the sun. It could even have been the dangerous, sometimes even terrifying monsters that were roaming around, the very creatures that he was trying to document.\n\nOn second thought, it was probably that last one.\n\nOver the course of half a year, the Royal Environmental Agency had been working hard and spending quite a bit on bringing back monsters and restoring their homelands. It certainly was not a normal endeavour in the eyes of the world at large, as many nations in fact wanted to achieve the exact opposite, to wipe out the monsters that might endanger their citizens. But here they were bears, creatures who were strong and united with nature no matter how dangerous it was.\n\nAnd finally their efforts had seemed to pay off. For as the count across the clans finished, the populations of creatures were higher than any in recorded bear history. The arctic timberwolves once again had a sustainable population, and the great Ursa Majors and Ursa Minors roamed the land. Tryvge would be able to report back to the Princess with a job well done. And hopefully, should it eventually come to it, these magnificent beasts would help protect us should any foreign invader seek to invade us and take our lands."
volsungrb.10.a:0 "A successful return to the balance of old."

volsungrb.11.t:0 "Plains of Snow and Ice"
volsungrb.11.d:0 "Ice, snow and more ice. Those were the things that bears saw every day this far north. To many, it was more surprising to not seem them somewhere than the other way around. The fields of pure white were beautiful sights when left undisturbed, something that few other places around the world could replicate. And that was exactly why Tryvge and the Royal Environmental Agency had gone around inspecting and closing off sites deemed the most important to nature and wildlife, to preserve it for the far future and ensure that future generations of bears would be able to see their glory as well.\n\nIt was a much harder task than they first expected. Surveying all the land of bears with their limited resources was no easy feat, and convincing the few bears who lived on land deemed protected to move was even moreso. But the process was finally over, and as Tryvge looked out over the lands he called home he knew it was all worth it. Perhaps they would lose some from keeping these parts of nature virgin. But the bears already knew how to leave no trace, how to live off the land and build around such obstacles. And they would grow stronger from it, as they did from all challenges they faced."
volsungrb.11.a:0 "The tundras will always be the place we can call home."

volsungrb.12.t:0 "Standing United"
volsungrb.12.d:0 "She did it. Eira was still a bit surprised at the speed at which it was done, but it had happened. Somehow, without having to subjugate the clans, she and Clan Volsungr had achieved what had never been done before, unity as the first among equals. The clans were no longer fighting among themselves, instead they were actively cooperating with each other and sharing their ideas. Paw may have made them into one nation, but Eira had been the one to bring them together in thought and deed.\n\nPerhaps it was the ideology that was behind it all. Eira had known that Harmony was that which brought creatures together, after all Equestria was the best proof of that. What she hadn't expected was for both it and ursines to come together so well in defense of nature. But they had, and here they were now.\n\nWith the initial reforms finished, now Princess Eira could finally turn her attention to the world at large. There were still more things to sort out internally, of course, as well as the question of who she would marry. But those would come with time, and both friends and enemies would not wait for the ursines to do such things. It was time for the polar bears to take their place in the world, whether creatures liked it or not."

You seem to really care about nature and the animals living there, with everything you’ve done so far. It’s nice to know someone else sees and appreciates them just like I do. I really wish that Princess Celestia would do more to help nature in Equestria; some places I’ve visited aren’t doing very well lately.\n\nYesterday when I was visiting Canterlot, I ran into one of your friends in the castle. Rainbow Dash was a little rude and he got a bit angry, but after they calmed down I talked to him about where he came from. He showed me some pictures from there, the fields and forests, and they were really beautiful! There were creatures I had never seen before, and I was going to ask for more before Pinkie came by and he had to leave.\n\nI’d like to come visit sometime, if that’s okay with you. It seems like such a wonderful place up there, with all kinds of plants and animals I’ve never seen before. I know it’s really cold up there, even more than the Crystal Empire, and Twilight told me that it might be dangerous, but I’m sure I can convince Princess Celestia to let me go if I ask her.\n\nFrom, Fluttershy"

volsungrb.14.d:0 "The Equestrian court today has received an odd request, as a group of ursines hailing from the far north has come to ask for an audience with [ROOT.GetLeader]. The polar bears have been here for some time now, as following the opening up of trade through the frozen seas they have employed our advisors in their own court. Now they want to take the cooperation to what they say is its natural conclusion, with an official entry into the [ROOT.GetFactionName].\n\nNopony has really paid any serious attention to the region as of late, as for a long time they were seen by most as an irrelevant backwater on the world stage. But now they they are fellow nation of Harmony, and we could always use another ally in these tumultuous times.

volsungrb.17.t:0 "The Visit"
volsungrb.17.d:0 "The weather was relatively calm all things considered as Princess Eira waited outside the caves of Clan Volsungr. Today was an important day, for their honored guest from Equestria, the Element Bearer of Kindness Fluttershy had finally arrived from her long trip by boat from Manehattan to the islands of Jan Mayen and Clan Anker. The Princess had originally wanted to meet with her there, but urgent business had come up and she had been forced to instead send a delegation to escort her the rest of the way south. They were all trusted warriors personally entrusted to the task by Eira, so she had no doubts that Fluttershy would arrive safely.\n\nSure enough, the silhouettes of bears and ponies soon became apparent on the path up the mountain. The ursines seemed to take up the outer reaches of the group, while the detachment of royal guards most likely sent by Equestria maintained a close proximity to Fluttershy herself. The mare appeared to be shivering, despite the heavy winter attire she wore. When they finally reached the Princess, the bears took up their positions as her guard, while the ponies barring the Element Bearer stood at attention.\n\n"Welcome, Fluttershy," Eira said as she extended a paw to shake in a traditional Equestrian greeting. "I hope your trip here was pleasant."\n\nThe butterscotch mare blinked, before shaking it with a hoof. "Oh, um, it was, thank you. Your polar bears were very nice."\n\n"How was the scenery?"\n\n"Oh, the scenery was just wonderful!" It was like a switch was flipped on Fluttershy, going from withdrawn to gushing. "The trees and plants were beautiful, especially with all the snow! I’ve never seen anything like it back in Equestria!"\n\nPrincess Eira nodded. "Thank you. We worked for a long time to restore much of the regions here." The silence that followed was long and awkward, as neither knew how to continue the conversation. Both shifted uncomfortably where they were standing, until Eira finally spoke up again. "We should head inside, I have had refreshments set up in my quarters. Follow-"\n\n"Turabaq!" one of the bears called out. The Equestrians immediately got into a defensive position around Fluttershy while the bears quickly readed themselves. The beast roared from its position above them on a rock face, it’s long tail and white coat fluttering in the wind.\n\nFluttershy herself, to the utter dismay of her guards, immediately flew ahead up to the turabaq. Eira rushed forward to try and rescue the pony from the monster, but was surprised to see that she didn’t actually need saving. In fact, the turabaq was even letting the mare pet its coat while... purring?\n\nMaybe she could be the one teaching them about nature after all."
volsungrb.17.a:0 "We should have her visit again sometime."

volsungrb.18.t:0 "A Request from the Frozen North"
volsungrb.18.d:0 "The court today has received an odd request, as a group of ursines hailing from the far north has come to ask for an audience with Princess Cadence. The polar bears have been here for sometime now, having taken some crystal pony advisors for their own court and learning from us about medicine and crystal technology. Now they want to take that cooperation one step further, with an official pact ensuring mutual non-aggression and military access.\n\nNo crystal pony has really paid any serious attention to nations that far in the north, as they are seen by many as irrelevant backwaters on the world stage. They are a fellow nation of Harmony, though, and perhaps agreeing to this could prove beneficial if not now than in the far future. With the situation in Equestria, we hardly need another possible enemy, so perhaps we should forge these closer bonds while we have the chance."
volsungrb.18.a:0 "Let us celebrate our new ursine friends!"
volsungrb.18.b:0 "We will have to respectfully decline."

volsungrb.19.t:0 "The Crystal Empire Accepts"
volsungrb.19.d:0 "The bonds between us and the crystal ponies have been strengthed today, for word has come that Princess Cadence has accepted our request! A party apparently occured shortly after in the Crystal City, involving much traditional bear combat, drinking and feasting. A few ponies even joined in, and while our delegates present were careful with them as ponies were notoriously fragile compared to bears, injuries were unavoidable as their best warriors wanted to spar with ours. Ursines and equines alike were in the hospital by the end of it, but fortunately even Princess Cadence seemed to take it in good spirit."
volsungrb.19.a:0 "Let our new friendship last for eternity!"

volsungrb.20.t:0 "The Crystal Rejection"
volsungrb.20.d:0 "Startling and unfortunate news, Princess Cadence has declined our offer for closer relations. Many elders have been left wondering why, for they had assumed that the spirit of Harmony would have been enough to bring us together in friendship. Perhaps Cadence is not as forgiving or as open as we thought? Or maybe the bridges between bears and ponies are truly too wide to be crossed?"
volsungrb.20.a:0 "A quite unfortunate setback."

volsungrb.21.t:0 "The Bear-Yak Treaty Proposal"
volsungrb.21.d:0 "A curious proposal has arrived at Yakistown, from the bears of all races. It seems that they too have begun to open themselves to the outside world from isolation, led by a Princess of Harmony who came to power in recent years. They have approached us with an offer to solidify our relations with a formal pact of friendship, which includes an agreement of non-aggression and military access through countries.\n\nIt is true that us Yaks do have a long history with the ursines. Some of our northern clans have fought them in a sort of ritualized combat for generations. However, the polar bears are known to be a naturally combative race, and we may not want to associate with what may be an openly antagonistic nation. The delegation of bears is waiting for a response."
volsungrb.21.a:0 "A round of SMASHing to our friends in the North!"
volsungrb.21.b:0 "We can not sign anything with them at the moment."

volsungrb.22.t:0 "The Proposal Accepted"
volsungrb.22.d:0 "Our diplomats have returned to the clans in high spirits, for the Yaks have accepted our agreement! It seems that there was a great party thrown involving large amounts of drinking, SMASHing, fighting, and general friendship-creating activities. Let us celebrate this rekindling of our bonds and strengthening of our ties as a new age to the relationship between us!"
volsungrb.22.a:0 "Hurrah!"

volsungrb.23.t:0 "The Proposal Rejected"
volsungrb.23.d:0 "It seems that our efforts to further the ties between us and the Yaks have failed, for our diplomats have returned empty-pawed. No ursine is entirely sure why they would refuse to sign such an agreement, leaving many in clans confused. Were they not a fellow nation and race of snow and ice? Were polar bears and yaks not the best of friends? Perhaps their isolationist past has driven this decision, or perhaps something else we were not aware of is at play."
volsungrb.23.a:0 "Whatever happened to the shared polar spirit?"

volsungrb.24.t:0 "Fate of the Queendom"
volsungrb.24.d:0 "And that was that. As the changeling drone was escorted out by understandably wary nanooks, the Princess could finally rest easy knowing that the changeling matter was finally settled for good. They may have won the war some time ago, that was true, but what to do with the entire Queendom was an ever-present issue that needed addressing. Fortunately, that issue was one that happened to resolve itself rather quickly.\n\nSoon after they sent out bears to look for changelings willing to work in a new harmonic-aligned regime, a single drone named Thorax appeared. He had been running a resistance against Chrysalis for some time, and said that he was willing to help lead his fellow drones into Harmony. It was exactly the type of changeling they needed, as they could not just reasonably administrate all the land of the former Queendom. So, this "Thorax" would make an excellent substitute.\n\nJust to ensure a smooth transition of power, an official agreement was signed between Eira and Thorax. The terms were harsh but fair on the changelings; they would comply to any and all orders the polar bears would give them, reorganize under the government of Thorax, and most importantly surrender the hive of Soryth and the surrounding area to Eira. Even if he had wanted to, Thorax had no room for negotiation, as the Princess had made clear that these terms were not up for debate. They had forced ursines into a grueling war that they had lost, and this was the price they had to pay. She did promise, however, that the changelings in Soryth would be taken care of and protected as a new part of the frozen north."
volsungrb.24.a:0 "The Menace of Equus is no more!"

volsungrb.25.t:0 "Dealing with the Griffons"
volsungrb.25.d:0 "Ever since the issues the former nation to our east had been resolved, an impasse had been created on the topic of the future of the avian race. The original idea for them was to allow them to create their own state again and rule themselves, albeit with heavy bear oversight. This would allow the bears to focus on completing naturalization of the Griffonian Frontier, which we would take direct administration of. The relatively backwater lands would be quick to integrate, and would not cause much trouble.\n\nThe other proposal is to outright annex all the land. Some bears say that the fall of Nova Griffonia from Harmony is proof that they can not be allowed to rule at all, and that bears themselves must stand up to lead in their stead. Trying to naturalize all that land would be incredibly difficult and integration will most likely not be accomplished in any reasonable amount of time, but they are sure that eventually the griffons could become just like ourselves, bears in all but name and strength."
volsungrb.25.a:0 "The avians can be trusted to rule themselves."
volsungrb.25.b:0 "They are not ready to lead yet."

volsungrb.26.t:0 "The Yak Question"
volsungrb.26.d:0 "The Yak clans have always had a close relationship with that of Clan Volsungr itself. For many years we engaged in ritualized wars and battles with the northern tribes, building a friendship with them and at the time legitimizing ourselves with the other bear clans as Yaks are close in spirit and strength to us. Their tradition of SMASHing as they call it was very honorable and a show of kindredness. It is for the exact reason that some bears believe that a union of Yaks and Bears is possible as one nation, not divided by race, but united by strength and Harmony.\n\nHowever, that very same argument of spiritual unity and strength is being used by other bears to show why the Yaks and Jaks should have their own states back. They have proven capable of ruling themselves and even if they were led astray once, bear oversight will ensure it does not happen again. We will keep and integrate the northernmost land and tribes as a new clan of the bears, but the rest will be largely governed by the local Yak or Jak tribes."
volsungrb.26.a:0 "The Yaks and Jaks are strong, they will rule themselves better."
volsungrb.26.b:0 "Our strength will be our unity as one nation!"

volsungrb.27.t:0 "The Polar Princessdom"
volsungrb.27.d:0 "Considering the recent victories against many of our former neighbors in the north, it was clear that something new was just on the horizon for all ursines. For their land not only had polar bears now, but also penguins, yaks and even griffons. Change was needed, a new name and a new capital. And so it was decided that a new coronation would take place to herald such a monumentous occasion.\n\nIt was quite similar to the original crowning of Eira, but with a few striking differences. For one, this was not taking place in a fortress in Mathair Fearainn, but inside a specially designed cavern within the Volsungr holds, a location that would soon be the official capital. There was also the attendees, for now there were griffons and penguins and yaks all dispersed among the crowd. But the ceremony was identical, the same crown was used, and when she stood all those before her cheered not to a Princess of Polar Bears, but to the Princess of Polaria, the newest realm of the north."
volsungrb.27.a:0 "To a new union of species!"

volsungrb.28.t:0 "The Soryth Proposal"
volsungrb.28.d:0 "In the Great War against the Changeling Queendom, one of our less-renowned allies was the Polar Bears to the far north, a fellow nation of Harmony and friendship. And though many ponies do not think of them very often when the war is brought up, they played an important role in extending the conflict across a new front, distracting the Changeling forces from our own.\n\nNow Princess Eira, leader of the nation has come with a request. They seek to take administration of the hive of Soryth, one close to their border on the shores of Key Lake, as well as the surrounding area. The states in question are very unpopulated barring Soryth itself and considered general wastelands, though there are some resources of note in the region. How should we respond?"
volsungrb.28.a:0 "The Polar Bears fought hard beside us, they deserve it."
volsungrb.28.b:0 "Even with their help, these demands are absurd!"

volsungrb.29.t:0 "The Equestrians Accept"
volsungrb.29.d:0 "Seeing our invaluable support in the war against the former changeling menace, the Equestrians have accepted our request and transfered all the land in question, including the hive of Soryth to our protection. This is a great day for all Polar Bears, and a few bears are already asking for permission to settle on the newly acquired land, which is relatively unpopulated. The exception to this is the hive of course, the citizens of which we shall treat with respect as one of our own now."
volsungrb.29.a:0 "Let us celebrate!"

volsungrb.30.t:0 "The Equestrians Refuse"
volsungrb.30.d:0 "For whatever reason, the ponies have seen to deny our request for Soryth and the surrounding region. Perhaps they thought our contribution to the war effort was not enough to warrant it, or perhaps they wish to cater to their new subject in the Changeling Lands. Either way, our representatives have returned to the north disappointed, and this will not be a refusal we will forget anytime soon."
volsungrb.30.a:0 "But why?"


volsungrb.51.t:0 "The Crowning"
volsungrb.51.d:0 "Deep within the mountain hold of Clan Volsungr, a great hall was prepared for the coronation taking place. Leaders from all clans were invited to attend, though a few of them had to be "persuaded" into arriving. Once everybear had arrived, the ceremony commenced, with the entire thing being done by various Volsungr elders. The crown was made of the finest starsteel and gold, with a heavy diamond set within the front.\n\nThere was a real reason why all the leaders had to be in attendance, however. When the moment came for Eira to be pronounced Queen, all of them knelt and renewed their oaths as subjects to the newly-christened monarch. No longer would they be a simple group of ursines. They would have a name for their country, a true name reflecting that of their land, their untamed, wild and bear-ruled land. One using the old bear tongue.\n\nAnd so, the Utemmet Rike was born. From the ashes of the old, a new realm would be created. There was still much to be done, things like fixing the nation, dealing with Svartpels and Scyfling, and most importantly finding where we stand in the world. But the first step has been taken, and that step is always the largest."
volsungrb.51.a:0 "It is time to get to work."


volsungrb.67.t:0 "On the Matter of Outcasts"
volsungrb.67.d:0 "The meeting room was rather simple, a single stone table with two chairs, one on each side. Paw Wellington was already sitting in one, still dressed in his priestly robes despite the ceremony he had presided over having ended hours ago. It was the attire he wore a majority of the time now, one of the few things he could still lead that wasn't shattered by Eira's takeover of leadership...\n\nThe door opened and Torben walked in, wearing his official armor just like he always did. "Old friend!" he roared cheerfully, shaking his paw just as he had many times before and as Paw had taught him many years ago. "It is good to see you once again!"\n\n"And you as well, Torben." He gestured for the Thunder Lord to take a seat, which he did. "I did not send for you just to discuss pleasantries, however. The Queen has asked us to create a policy regarding the entry of..." Paw paused, knowing that Torben wasn't going to take this well. "...Outcasts."\n\nTorben grunted, pounding the table with a paw. "Is it not clearly obvious? These outcasts caused our disunity in the first place! Letting them continue to enter would only be a great folly, and we need to keep them out!"\n\n"Unfortunately, the Queen has already made it clear that doing so is not an option. Her and I were once outcasts as well, after all." Torben remained silent, which Paw took as deep contemplation. "But you are right, we can not repeat past mistakes. So my plan is to create a test for any outcast wishing to return home. With your clan's help, they will be questioned on their beliefs, their knowledge of tradition. Only those we believe are worthy will be able to rejoin us in strength."\n\nSlowly, Torben nodded. "An excellent idea, friend! Only those who can find a place here will help us, while those who can't or wish us ill will remain outcasts for eternity! I will personally help with this plan."\n\n"Good. Then I will begin drafting the proposal immediately.""
volsungrb.67.a:0 "Not every outcast should be a part of our future."


volsungrb.69.t:0 "On the Matter of Religion"
volsungrb.69.d:0 "At a round table in Clan Scyfling's largest fortress, five bears sat all in a circle facing each other, all priests of their regional fortresses. Paw Wellington himself sat at the head, having the honor of the largest and most decorated chair due to still being the head of the clan and now also the head of religious matters. He had originally called them here to discuss the future of worship in the clan, but the past hour had quickly deteriorated into squabbling between pairs; one side declaring that they should reject the whole system and adopt the pony way as Volsungr did, the other remaining steadfast in their belief that they simply did not lean into Griffonian inspiration hard enough.\n\n"The simple fact is, we lost to an ideology we once thought had no merit, and it is time to come to terms with that!" one bear roared. "They proved the superiority of the pony way, and now we must follow suit!"\n\nAnother slammed the table with both paws, sending cracks through the ice. "There is no need for such a thing! We were wrong, yes, but it was not in our inspiration, it was in that we kept to outdated and foolish traditions! We simply need to take more from the Three Temples what is necessary and our strength will be shown once again!"\n\n"Your proposal puts everything on the importance of war, of conflict, when Volsungr defeated us using nothing of the sort!"\n\n"They seized our moment of weakness, and if we had strengthened ourselves in warfare it never would have happened!"\n\n"Enough!" Paw Wellington's voice carried throughout the entire room, forcing a silence as all bears turned their eyes on him. "Thank you for coming, but I will be making the decision here. You may all return to your quarters." The priests all looked at each other before bowing and exiting the room hastily.\n\nPaw, left alone with his thoughts, remained in his chair as his mind began turning. He had been wrong, that much was made clear. He had, despite everything he had tried and all the progress he had made, failed. It was a difficult concept to grasp but one that was necessary to move forward. The only question now was how to do so. As the bear had said, was it the inspiration itself or just not going far enough?\n\nWould the future of Scyfling and their faith be of the pony way, or of the griffon?"
volsungrb.69.a:0 "One way or another, change must come."


volsungrb.71.t:0 "The Griffon Way of War"
volsungrb.71.d:0 ""The point of the issue we have is that our religious traditions have been shown to be fundamentally flawed," the priest explained to Paw Wellington in a private room. "Each region has its own divinities and beliefs from ancient traditions which has ultimately prevented us from being unified in spirit. The griffons allowed their regional deities, but they all worshiped the same three gods as well."\n\nPaw Wellington scratched his chin. "So what is your idea, then?"\n\n"I believe that creating a central divine figure for all bears of our clan to rally behind is the solution. And after looking through the Three Temples of Griffonia, the god they call Arcturius is the best model. He is the god of war to them, of forges and knights. A deity like him will bring out the war-like temper of us all, unite us in battle and faith."\n\n"But how will that strengthen the clan?"\n\nThe priest put a paw on the table for emphasis. "When the Griffonian Empire was at war, fighting its enemies, it was strong. When an era of peace befell it, it grew weak and collapsed. War is an essential part of it, and even if the Queen will not allow us to strike first we must be ready. As long as we are prepared for war, as long as it is within us, we shall never fracture like we once did." The ursine pounded the table for good measure, sending deep cracks into the clear ice.\n\nPaw Wellington nodded. "Very well, go ahead with this. You have my support. Now leave me, I have a meeting with the Queen soon." Bowing, the bear quickly took his leave."
volsungrb.71.a:0 "To never be caught off-guard again, we must always be prepared."



protectorate.1.t:0 "The Story of Winged Bears"
protectorate.1.d:0 "Covered in black and white fur and armored in yellow chitin, the bugbears are one of the great monsters of the world. Even singular individuals are more than a match for almost any warrior or even other beasts of similar or greater size and might. However if one encounters an entire swarm of bugbears, the only chance of survival would be a timely escape as even our direbear ancestors couldn’t defeat entire swarms by themselves. \n\nAnother danger of facing these beasts is that differently from most creatures of such size and might, bugbears are intelligent creatures, possessing a great memory and ability to work in large groups.\n\nDespite the dangers of facing such creatures, hunting bugbears is an activity which most prominent figures within the clan are expected to partake in order to show their might and combat prowess. However, this tradition has been followed by a somewhat interesting phenomenon as there are always several would be thunder warriors that do not show interest in slaying such beasts, rather wishing and attempting to tame them, sometimes with great results.\n\nOf course in traditional polar bear society such individuals were banished after being inevitably defeated by the larger members of the clan. Differently from most other outcasts who chose to travel more civilized lands, these bears would disappear into wilderness. They would spend their lives wandering through places least touched by civilization, taming bugbears and sometimes even more exotic and rare creatures.\n\nHowever the new leader of all polar bears and the overlord of the Changeling Northern Protectorate Bjornling has a completely different views from the leaders and elders that were deposed after their resistance efforts were crushed. During his years of exile he had gathered the many tamers that were scattered across Equus and convinced them to join his warband. The bugbear swarms that these exiles brought with them were particularly effective during the reconquest of the North, and thus the military and political leadership of the Northern Protectorate has decided that these bugbear tamers and their swarms should be reformed into support battalions and integrated into the armed forces of the protectorate to be used against the enemies of Changeling Hegemony.\n\nFurthermore, it was agreed upon that in order to gain even greater benefit from having access to such unique specialists, the talents and abilities of these former outcasts will be used to create institutions to prepare new tamers and tamed bugbear swarms in order to ensure that the armies of Northern Protectorate will never face danger of loosing the advantage these swarms of monsters provide."
