 equestria.139.t:0 "Issue of conscription"
 equestria.139.d:0 "Since Equestria has not been touched by war in centuries, drafting ponies into military was never necessary. However, with growing threat on horizon, some politicians have proposed to institute a draft to better prepare our country for the coming storm."

 equestria.139.b:0 "A limited draft shall suffice."
 equestria.139.c:0 "We have to be prepared for anything - institute extensive conscription."

 equestria.140.t:0 "Economic focus"
 equestria.140.d:0 "Equestrian economy has great potential, however right now it is focused on providing goods and services for the ponies - as it has for decades. That being said, it might be prudent to start focusing on defence and heavy industries - to safeguard our nation in a changing world."

 equestria.142.d_off:0 "With our army bravely fighting the enemy, some of the leading national publications have started to print pacifist messages, urging to end the war immediately.

 equestria.151.a:0 "Reforms of civilian administration will suffice."
 equestria.151.b:0 "Military will join civilians for the time of war."
