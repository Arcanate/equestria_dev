 ### FOCUS ###
 CNT_marry_golian:0 "Marry King Golian"
 CNT_marry_golian_desc:0 "In order to secure good relations with our northern allies, Queen Karuk will invoke an ancient tradition. For centuries, the rulers of Senturya have married with those of Gargiloya, maintaining amicable relations and keeping the royal bloodlines deeply intertwined. Considering the present tension between our two kingdoms, it would be most prudent for Queen Karuk to secure a marriage with King Golian."

 CNT_industrialize_senturya_desc:0 "The late King Sidouk started a wave of transformative, but controversial, industrialization policies. Their success was short-lived, however, as the Storm King's invasion and Sidouk's death shortly thereafter paralyzed the program. With the Storm King's death and the return of peace under Queen Karuk, it is the perfect time to revitalize these policies and continue our industrialization."
 CNT_production:0 "Boost Our Production"
 CNT_production_desc:0 "Most of our factories run on old equipment, which hampers their productivity. This is a clear problem for the foreseeable future and must be rectified as soon as possible. To this end, we must further develop our equipment and boost our productivity to match the growing needs of a modern Senturya."
 CNT_mad_scientist:0 "Hire some Mad Scientists"
 CNT_mad_scientist_desc:0 "In order to continue advancing in the sciences, we require a legion of the brightest minds Senturya has to offer. We must do anything and everything possible to further our intellectual capabilities, even if it means we must hire a few mad scientists."
 CNT_civilian_factories:0 "Construct Additional Factories"

 CNT_military_factories:0 "Minor Militarization"
 CNT_military_factories_desc:0 "As we construct new factories across the Senturyan expanse, it would be wise to purpose some towards producing material required to maintain our modernizing armies. One never knows when another attack will strike, and it is always good to be prepared in case one does."
 CNT_more_resources:0 "Oil for the Engines..."
 CNT_more_resources_desc:0 "As we continue to mechanize our military, it is becoming increasingly clear that if we do not secure access to a stable fuel source, our military will be severly crippled. To prevent this, we must find ways of obtaining fuel without the use of crude oil."
 CNT_develop_southwest:0 "...and Metal for the Bodies"
 CNT_develop_southwest_desc:0 "With our fuel fears resolved for the time being, we can now focus on the procurement of metals that are vital in constructing a mechanized military. The southwest, little explored and undeveloped for centuries, has shown to contain deposits of these key resources. By expanding our operations in the region, we can secure a steady stream of iron and chromium to our factories and shipyards."
 CNT_build_neglected_southwest:0 "Develop the Interior"
 CNT_build_neglected_southwest_desc:0 "For eons, Senturya's deep interior has remained underdeveloped and backwards, a patchwork of villages and farmland. With the coming of the industrial age, this is becoming untenable, as Senturya's growing population and advanced military need more and more resources. It is time to leave the past and to develop the interior into a truly integral part of the nation."

 CNT_agyz:0 "Agyz"
 CNT_agyz_desc:0 "Agyz - "the Opening", it is the holiest site in all of Senturya, and represents their first glimpse of freedom. As the legend goes, the centaurs were fleeing from the zebra city-states, which sought to enslave them. After moving through the wastes and mountains for over a year, they found a hilly passage between two towering peaks. When they crossed it, they found a vast, lush plain, untamed, and uninhabited. The centaurs were overfilled with joy, and set up a stone marked with runes to celebrate the beginning of a new life. They would then spread out across the land, forming the nation of Senturya. However, some centaurs chose to remain at what they called Agyz, and pilgrims came from across the land to express their gratitude for this gateway to salvation, and made donations to the Keepers of the Stone. A small town rose up around the stone, consisting of the Keepers and their families. The town has become wealthier as the number of pilgrimages increased in recent years, and donations flood in from across the realm, including a ritual stipend from the Royal Family."
