 ### Ideas ###
 
 GIF_repairing_twinzanbwe:0 "Repairing Twizanbwe"
 GIF_repairing_twinzanbwe_desc:0 "Following the raid of one of the Storm King's generals in 1002, large portions of the capital of Twizanbwe and its gold mines were damaged. Since then, a monumental repair effort has been put in motion, costing us significantly. The Raid has also damaged the Twizanbwean dynasty’s prestige, making the efforts even more important."
 GIF_trade_with_kompels:0 "Trade With The Kompels"
 GIF_trade_with_kompels_desc:0 "Since the arrival of the griffon Kompels centuries ago east of Twizanyika, the giraffes have enjoyed a friendly trade relationship with them, exchanging goods through the decades. As the Kompels slowly became the most industrialized nation on this part of Zebrica, Twizanyika experienced the arrival of industrial goods, for better or worse. However, with the Storm King's and his general's campaigns through Zebrica, trade northwards has been disrupted; and the giraffes' trade relationship with the Kompels has become dependent, greatly delaying modernisation efforts in the High Kingdom."
 GIF_individual_armies:0 "The Kingdoms' Armies"
 GIF_individual_armies_desc:0 "Twizanyika lacks a centralized military, instead relying on the armies of its individual Kingdoms and their vassals. While this worked in the past, and some giraffes may fight better for their homes, it is entirely unsuitable for the modern era."
 GIF_traditionalists_angered:0 "Traditionalists Displeased"
 GIF_traditionalists_angered:0 "Our recent actions have caused the more traditionalist powerful giraffes in Twizanyika to be displeased with Retikula's rule. We must watch this carefully, before it gets out of hoof."
 GIF_traditionalists_angered_2:0 "Traditionalists Angered"
 GIF_traditionalists_angered_2_desc:0 "More transgressive actions by us has now caused the traditionalist giraffes to be angered at our government. We are beginning to lose their support for our rule, but they remain largely loyal... for now."
 GIF_traditionalists_angered_3:0 "Traditionalists Greatly Angered"
 GIF_traditionalists_angered_3_desc:0 "Our further actions have greatly angered the traditionalists giraffes within Twizanyika, and some are even starting to support treacherous factions! We must rectify this at once."
 GIF_gold_rush:0 "Digging Gold"
 GIF_gold_rush_desc:0 "A small gold rush has been initiated in Twizanbwe as a consequence of the High King's promise of wealth to the common giraffe."
 GIF_twizanyikan_war:0 "The Second Twizanyikan War"
 GIF_twizanyikan_war_desc:0 "Following King Dzinashe's move to topple High King Retikula and the Twizanbwean dynasty from power, the Second Twizanyikan War has erupted. The internal fabric of Twizanyika tears itself apart and our economy suffers as the two largest Kingdoms of the country fight each other for the fate of the giraffes."

 ### Decisions ###
 
 GIF_dzinashi_coup:0 "The Plot"
 GIF_dzinashi_coup_desc:0 "High King Retikula, and especially the Twizanbwean dynasty, have proven that they have lost the capability to rule Twizanyika effectively. We have grown dependent on the griffons to the east, delaying our modernisation; and they have failed to protect their own capital from foreign raids, losing much wealth and prestige in the process. It is clear, that there is a need for a change in Twizanyika. And King Dzinashe III of Matanda is willing to be that change.

 ### Leaders ###
 
 GIF_high_king_retikula_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of February, 952 in Twizanbwe.\n\n§YBiography§!: Retikula was born as the first child of the Twizanbwean King, and by consequence the High King of Twizanyika, Samhuri III. Taking his grandfather's name, the young Retikula was raised as a calf to be the perfect example of Twizanbwe's traditions and prestige over the rest of the giraffe Kingdoms. He was taught the basics and the advanced arts of combat necking; the history of Twizanyika and Twinzanbwe; the matters of administration; and how to be a faithful giraffe of the Gods Ivhu and Zuva.\n\nWhen his father died in 978 ALB, Retikula ascended to the Great Twizanbwe's throne as High King Retikula II, vowing to embody the same traditions and beliefs he had been raised in. Retikula's rule was peaceful and uneventful for the first decade or so, as Twizanyika prospered from trade and the rest of the Twizanyikan Kingdoms were under the rule of friendly or neutral monarchs. But when one of the Storm King's generals raided Twizanbwe in 1002 ALB, everything took a turn for the chaotic. A large portion of the city's gold and luxuries were pillaged by the raiders, and Great Twizanbwe's walls were damaged by the attackers.\n\nRetikula has now the spent the last years steering the High Kingdom's repair efforts, and dealing with the damaged prestige and stolen wealth his lands have suffered. Most recently, he has called a meeting of the Grand Council of Twizanyika, where the four monarchs of the giraffes all meet to discuss and agree on the affairs and actions of the High Kingdom. Retikula is trying to use this as a catalyst for change in Twizanyika, as the recent experiences have convinced the giraffe that the country must modernise and industralize in the coming years if Twizanyika were to have a future as an independent nation."

 ### Focuses ###
 
 GIF_first_tree_begin:0 "Convene The Grand Council"
 GIF_first_tree_begin_desc:0 "With the year 1007 just beginning, High King Retikula has convened the Grand Council of Twizanyika's monarchs. There are many issues that need to be dealt with, and fast."
 GIF_visit_zuvera:0 "A Visit To Zuvera"
 GIF_visit_zuvera_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Zuvera has always been, and always will be, Twizanbwe's most faithful ally in Twizanyika. In order to strengthen this historic friendship, and to keep our support in the Council, a visit to queen Kudzaishe in Zuvera is in good order."
 GIF_the_coal_issue:0 "The Coal Problem"
 GIF_the_coal_issue_desc:0 "Recently, large deposits of coal have been found by Zuveran miners in the foothills of the Gurnam mountains. While historically we haven't had much use for it, coal is a vital resource needed to power up industry. Trade-minded giraffes have proposed an export deal to the Kompels, while detractors argue it will only increase our dependence on the griffons."
 GIF_talk_with_the_guilds:0 "A Meeting With The Guilds"
 GIF_talk_with_the_guilds_desc:0 "The stonemason and architect guilds of Zuvera are amongst the most powerful and prestigious of Twizanyika. More than a century ago, they helped to build the wonders of Great Twizanbwe, and today continue to supply our nation will experienced and capable giraffes. High King Retikula has decided that a meeting with them would be good - perhaps they would help to restore Twizanbwe, as their ancestors did many years ago."
 GIF_the_military_issue:0 "Patch Up The Military Issue"
 GIF_the_military_issue_desc:0 "The recent experiences with Boltrus' raid as well as the news of conflicts elsewhere in Zebrica and the world have shown that our military is incapable of fighting a modern war. Or rather, our militaries. Twizanyika lacks a centralized fighting force, instead relying on the armies of its individual Kingdoms. Some giraffes have proposed changing this, but to traditionalists' anger, of course."
 GIF_new_walls:0 "Repair The Walls"
 GIF_new_walls_desc:0 "While we have made good progress on repairing the walls of Great Twinzanbwe in the last years, the truth is that it is taking too long - and this has hurt our prestige immensely. But no more. With a final push of extra workers and funding, we will finally finish repairing the walls of our capital and restore them to even better conditions that they had in 1002."
 GIF_new_gold_rush:0 "A New Gold Rush?"
 GIF_new_gold_rush_desc:0 "Our surveyors in the Kuchamhembe mountains have come back with the report of more gold deposits deeper underground. While this would do well to fill our treasury back and cover costs, there are concerns that it working there would be too unsafe for the miners. In the end, High King Retikula will have to decide whether to exploit this opportunity or not."
 GIF_new_uses_land:0 "Repurposing Pillaged Land"
 GIF_new_uses_land_desc:0 "While on his path entering and leaving Twizanyika, Boltrus also took the opportunity to plunder the few villages and towns he encountered on his way. These lands now remain empty, as their inhabitants had fled from their homes before and after Boltrus came. With this in mind, a debate has emerged in Twizanyika on the use of these lands, which Retikula will need to settle."
 GIF_a_new_temple:0 "The New Temple"
 GIF_a_new_temple_desc:0 "With our push to repair Twizanbwe almost done, the time for the greatest task to be done is here. Twizanbwe's Temple, a grand testament to the prestige of the city's dynasty and the Gods, will also be given an extra workforce push in order to finish its restoration. Once this is done, Twinzanbwe will be great once again."
 GIF_visit_musangano:0 "Visiting Musangano"
 GIF_visit_musangano_desc:0 "The city of Musangano lies to the east, on the confluence of the Goridhe and Gungwa rivers. It is the capital of the eponymous Kingdom, which historically has been seen as the 'lesser' of Twizanyika's monarchies. However in the last decades it has prospered due to the trade with the Kompels, and so it is fitting that Retikula would make a visit to Queen Rungano and her lands."
 GIF_the_new_crops:0 "Talk With The Landowners"
 GIF_the_new_crops_desc:0 "The landowning giraffes of Musangano have gained quite a fame in the last years for pioneering new crops beyond the traditional acacia orchards, even gaining the support of Queen Rungano for this. While this is fine, some acacia farmers and landowners have grumbled at this, claiming to be replaced. Maybe it is time for Retikula to take a look at this and mediate?"
 GIF_crime_border:0 "The Revai Trial"
 GIF_crime_border_desc:0 "The trial of Revai ye Yero, a minor noble inside Musangano, has divided his native Kingdom for the last few months. What was initially a local matter quickly turned into a national one as the giraffe's trial became an even more political and divisive matter. Seeking an end of this, Retikula's ruling has been invoked - the High King will now have to decide and take a stance in this matter."
 GIF_discuss_with_matanda:0 "Discuss With Dzinashe"
 GIF_discuss_with_matanda_desc:0 "The King of Matanda, Twizanbwe's historical rival, has become more of a worry in the last months. Rumours have it that he's plotting against Retikula's rule, seeking to topple him from power. The High King has decided to take matters into his own hooves, and requested Dzinashe's presence in neutral ground to discuss matters. "
 GIF_adjourn_the_council:0 "Adjourn The Grand Council"
 GIF_adjourn_the_council_desc:0 "The more urgent matters of the last months have been taken care off to some extent, and Twizanbwe is now fully repaired. With this done, we can finally hold a final meeting of the Grand Council, to adjourn it for the year."
 
 ### Events ###
 
 twizanyika.1.t:0 "The Opening Of The Grand Council"
 twizanyika.1.d:0 "Unlike the many other years the High King of Twizanyika invoked a meeting of the nation's Grand Council, this time this proclamation did not involve much show. In the last weeks, the distinct monarchs of the High Kingdom had received simple letters, with only the light-red stamping signifying the Royal Seal of Twizanyika on it, telling them that High King Retikula II had convened the Grand Council in Twizanbwe.\n\nAnd so it was. First to arrive was Kudzaishe VII, the Queen of Zuvera, Twinzanbwe's historical ally through Twizanyikan history. Kudzaishe also arrived with a group of Zuveran architects, eager to work on the restoration project of the capital's Temple. The Queen's arrival was met with much enthusiasm from the city's inhabitants, as her entourage passed through the still-damaged commercial centre of the city. Entering the High King's residence, she was given a warm welcome by Retikula and his family alike, and both High King and Kudzaishe talked and discussed privately for many hours about the current state of Twizanyika, and the world at large.\n\nSecond to arrive was Rungano V, the Queen of Musangano, committed to upholding her Kingdom's reputation of neutrality and status-quo upholding. Though it is the less prestigious of the four Kingdoms, Musangano has prospered in the last years as trade with the griffon Kompels to the east increased in quantity. With her entourage came a group of Musangano's top merchants, wearing extravagant golden rings around their necks and legs, who months before vowed to invest more of their money into Twizanbwe's reconstruction efforts. Retikula met with these giraffes, thanking them for their investment promise, before also privately discussing with Queen Rungano; the giraffe particulary concerned about the future of Twizanyika's trade partnership with the Vrystaat.\n\nLast to come was Dzinashe III, the King of Matanda, Twizanbwe's historical rival. Unlike the other monarchs, Dzinashi did not arrive with any other entourage; instead only being escorted by a detachment of Matanda's Royal Guard, wearing simple ceremonial dressings. Dzinashi arrived and discussed shortly with Retikula, before both giraffes left for the Grand Council's meeting.\n\nThe issues that face Twizanyika are many at the moment: the issue of the trade with the Kompels, repairing Twizanbwe, and a myriad of other problems normally not important; but with the current political situation they now take the front seat in the giraffes' discourse. It is clear that this Grand Council meeting will perhaps be the most important in decades, if not the entire history of Twizanyika."
 twizanyika.1.a:0 "There's so much to do..."
 
 twizanyika.2.t:0 "A Visit To Zuvera"
 twizanyika.2.d:0 "One of High King Retikula's first locations to visit in Twizanyika was, of course, the Kingdom of Zuvera. Both Twinzanbwe and Zuvera had an historic alliance between each other, dating back even before what is traditionally thought as the beginning of this friendship - that is Zuvera's support of Twizanbwe in the war against Matanda in 803 ALB.\n\nThis alliance instead had its first origins a hundred or so years before that, when two high-ranking members of each dynasty married each other. From there, Zuvera's famous stonemasons woud lay the foundations of what would become Great Twizanbwe two hundred years later. In return, the Twizanbweans rewarded the Zuverans greatly for their support, granting them land from Matanda and giving them second preference in the gold trade - which had been monopolized by Twizanbwe following the unification of the giraffes in 803 ALB. This partnership continues to this day, seemingly unbreakable.\n\nThis was even more reaffirmed by Retikula's visit to Zuvera. As the High King and his entourage travelled from Twizanbwe and down the Gungwa River towards his destination, he passed by several towns and villages along the way, the giraffes living in them not wasting their perhaps once-in-a-lifetime chance of seeing the High King of Twizanyika.\n\nAs the High King entered the city, he was met with much fanfare, from either its inhabitants or Zuvera's Royal Guard. Queen Kudzaishe welcomed Retikula, before treating him and his entourage with a lavish lunch. Following this, both monarchs attended the city's stadium for the Combat Necking events; hoof-picked by Retikula to be held on this day, as he is a fan of the sport. The matches were preceded by a joint parade between the Zuveran and Twizanbwean Royal Guards, accompanied by traditional dancers and singers. The highlight of this was when the Twizanbweans put their twelve bronze cannons on full display, using them to end the ceremony with a bang.\n\nAt night, a great dinner was held, attended by a large number of important giraffes and nobles. The Guild heads, particulary, were interested in meeting the High King personally; which he accepted at a later date. Near the end of the dinner, the High King raised a cup full of imported Aquileian wine, and cleared his throat - bringing the entire party's attention. Then, he began to speak, and proclaimed:"
 twizanyika.2.a:0 "To an historic friendship!"
 
 twizanyika.3.t:0 "Resolving The Coal Problem"
 twizanyika.3.d:0 "One of the most important matters brought into debate for the last few months in Twizanyika was the discovery of several coal deposits in Zuvera's mountains. While historically we didn't have much use for coal, it is know that this resource is vital for the proper development and function of not only factories; but railroads and furnaces, amongst other machinery - all which our griffon neighbours to the east use to an extent.\n\nNaturally, this has brought up the question: what should we do? A faction, led by Queen Rungano of Musangano, propose that we should authorize the extraction of the coal; not only to export to the Kompels and increase our trade profits, but also to power the future factories of Twizanyika, according to Rungano. However, a second faction led mostly by traditionalists instead says that exploiting this coal will only increase our dependence to the Vrystaat, eventually surrendering our economic sovereignty to them.\n\nGiven he has absolute power over the final decisions in the Grand Council, what will Retikula choose?"
 twizanyika.3.a:0 "Authorize the extraction of the coal."
 twizanyika.3.b:0 "They are right, we must not increase our dependence."
 
 twizanyika.4.t:0 "Meeting The Guilds"
 twizanyika.4.d:0 "During his first day in Zuvera, representants from the Zuveran architects' and stonemasons' Guilds requested a meeting with the High King, declaring it a matter of high importance. Retikula agreed to their request, but scheduled the meeting with the Guilds for a few weeks in advance, as he had to tend to other duties through Twizanyika - the representant's declaration notwithstanding.\n\nBut now, the meeting had finally happened, and the Guilds; led by the head of the Architects' Tinaye Nhovo, have made an interesting proposal to the High King: The Guilds would be allowed full control over the operations of repair and construction of Twizanbwe, in exchange for the guarantee that they would be finished in record time. This was conflicting to Retikula for mainly two reasons: While the Guilds of Zuvera were well-known for their good construction practices - they had helped build the Great Twizanbwe, after all; it would come at the price of ceding power to them, which would undoubtedly anger the traditionalists giraffes. On the other hoof, refusing their help would sour the relationship with the Guilds, and it is not unlikely that they would turn to factions that would promise them more power.\n\nWhich option will Retikula choose?"
 twizanyika.4.a:0 "Of course."
 twizanyika.4.b:0 "Thanks for the offer, but I refuse."
 
 twizanyika.5.t:0 "A Letter"
 twizanyika.5.d:0 "The Queen of Musangano was, typically, neither a very busy nor a very idle giraffe. But with the Grand Council being invoked by Retikula, it seemed as if every issue just popped up at the forefront. First, of course, were the restoration efforts in Twizanbwe; but Revai's trial and the coal of Zuvera were also particulary concerning issues for her. The latter was a sour one for Rungano as well, as she just received the news that Retikula opted not to exploit the coal deposits in Zuvera. What was the High King's reasoning for rejecting the proposal, she didn't know - but it was as he wanted to hold back Twizanyika either unknowingly, or worse, on purpose. She shook her head as she stared out at the city of Musangano. The confluence of the rivers provided a great way for trade to flow in and out of Twizanyika, yet still the Kingdom was treated as a lesser in the Council.\n\nA servant shook her out of her thoughts. The shorter giraffe informed Rungano that a letter from Matanda had arrived, marked as one of high importance. The Queen thanked the servant before being handed the letter, and she frowned as she saw it bearing the official stamp of King Dzinashe III of Matanda. Opening the letter, she began to read it.\n\n"Queen Rungano V, of Musangano. The development of trade with the griffons to the east, as we both know, is of extreme importance to your Kingdom. However, with the High King's recent actions regarding coal, this trade is under threat for the sole reason of placating so-called traditionalist giraffes. It is with this that I propose that we form a common front in the Grand Council, for Matanda has also suffered from the lack of trade in the last decades. - King Dzinashi III of Matanda."\n\nRungano once again frowned as she finished reading the letter. Dzinashe was right, objetively, but she couldn't shake the feeling that empowering both of their Kingdoms was not the only reason he had sent this letter. Still, the least she could do is respond to the letter... or perhaps not. She formulated her response as she stood..."
 twizanyika.5.a:0 "Respond positively."
 twizanyika.5.b:0 "Ignore it and throw the letter away."
 
 twizanyika.6.t:0 "Military Reform"
 twizanyika.6.d:0 "Following the defeat of the Twizanbwean Royal Guard against the forces of Boltrus in 1002 ALB, a great wound was made to the pride of the giraffes' armies, and have shown to many the inherent outdatedness of Twizanyika's current military structure. To remedy this, two proposals have been put forward to High King Retikula.\n\nThe first one is put forward by Upenyu Bakatwa, the commander of the Twizanbwean Royal Guard, and a close friend of the High King. It proposes learning from the experiences of the defeat against Boltrus, to initiate a program of deep reform of not only Twizanbwe's army, but those of all Twizanyika. While Retikula agrees to this, it would undoubtedly lead to protests from traditionalists and the other monarchs of Twizanyika, who would see it as an interference of the High King inside their Kingdoms.\n\nThe second proposal is led by Fadzai Zvakaipa, this time the commander of Zuvera's Royal Guard - who had impressed High King Retikula with their perfomance in the stadium's events. Fadzai proposed a recruitment program to be instated through Twizanyika, aimed at bolstering the numbers of each country's Royal Guards and similar land units. While not glamorous, increasing our numbers is something that all giraffes can agree on.\n\nIn the end, it falls on the High King to pick an option."
 twizanyika.6.a:0 "Learn from our experiences."
 twizanyika.6.b:0 "Initiate a small recruitment drive."
 
 twizanyika.7.t:0 "New Uses For Old Land"
 twizanyika.7.d:0 "As Boltrus and his army of raiders, pillagers and thieves advanced towards and from Twizanbwe, it also left a great deal of damage in its way; mainly in the form of ransacked towns and villages. Now, years after the fact, the issue of what to do with these lands has been brought up to the Grand Council.\n\nLandowning lesser noble giraffes from around Twizanbwe and the Gungwa have proposed that these lands be cleared and reconverted for agricultural use, with the displaced giraffes being either moved to other towns and villages on Twizanbwe; or being given residence in the capital itself. This is popular, of course, with these same landowning giraffes - but will very likely cause anger from the refugees who will now see their homes being cleared for fields and orchards, and they may very likely hate our rule, with some advisors even saying that they may support anti-Retikula factions.\n\nThe second option proposes instead to form a resettlement program for the homeless giraffes, rebuilding their towns and villages. While simple enough, and gain us favour from the commoners, it will well displease the landowning giraffes that propose the agricultural clearing option. Apart from the support from the common giraffe, this proposal is also favoured by Queen Rungano of Musangano, who is concerned about the possible effects thousands of homeless giraffes may have on Twizanyika."
 twizanyika.7.a:0 "Resettle the displaced giraffes."
 twizanyika.7.b:0 "New agricultural lands sound good."
 
 twizanyika.8.t:0 "The Gold Rush"
 twizanyika.8.d:0 "Weeks ago, the High King dispatched a team of surveyors and veteran miners northwards to the Kuchamhembe mountains, in order to assess the gold situation in the region. Boltrus' thieves did a great deal of damage to the gold mines of Kuchamhembe, who have for centuries provided the Kingdom of Twizanbwe with much wealth and prestige - surely a blessing from Ivhu and Zuva. Great amounts of gold were stolen directly from the mines by Boltrus' raid, and for the last years Twizanyika as a whole has struggled from the effects of this.\n\nBut now, the surveying party has returned, with good news at that: there still exist very significant deposits of gold deeper inside the mountains, and around the foothills of them. They have proposed a campaign to draw common giraffes to the region, providing them with some means to start exploiting the gold. While this surely would help us greatly in rebuilding our wealth and prestige, its almost no drawbacks has generated suspicion in Retikula. Some giraffes have warned that Twizanyika lacks the proper tools to mine deep into the mountains, after all."
 twizanyika.8.a:0 "Initiate it!"
 twizanyika.8.b:0 "It sounds too good to be true."
 
 twizanyika.9.t:0 "An Accident"
 twizanyika.9.d:0 "Grave news have today reached the court of High King Retikula. It appears that a large mining accident has occured in one of the Kuchamhembe mountains gold mines. The exact cause of this is unknown, but speculation has led us to believe that the lack of adequate tools and training has led to a mistake in the excavation of the mines; leading to a cave-in.\n\nRegardless of any causes, the consequences are clear: hundreds of giraffes are trapped underground, though desperate efforts to rescue them are being initiated by other miners and local giraffes. Dissenting factions have already pounced against us and have started to criticize the government for their initiation of the Kuchamhembe gold rush, and even amongst the common giraffe who we thought would benefit from this, dissent is spreading."
 twizanyika.9.a:0 "Oh dear..."
 
 twizanyika.10.t:0 "The Musangano Journey"
 twizanyika.10.d:0 "A particular high priority for High King Retikula to visit was Musangano, the smallest and some say least prestigious of Twizanyika's Kingdoms. However, Musangano is still a Kingdom, with a voice in the Grand Council - and an ever growing one at that, since in the last decades it has slowly become an economic hotspot due to the increasing trade with the Kompels, at Matanda's expense, who has stagnated from the shifting commerce routes in Zebrica. Queen Rungano, the current monarch of Musangano, is an interesting giraffe; the youngest of all four monarchs of Twizanyika, she has mostly maintained the same thought as her predecessors, that of upholding the status-quo in Twizanyika. However, in the last years she has adopted new ideas, coming from other continents - and Musangano has become the centre of reform in Twizanyika as well, with measures such as land reform and some rights for the common giraffe being put in motion.\n\nRetikula started his journey going southwards from Twizanbwe, arriving in the small city of Chikepe, spending a day with the local lords before embarking on Twizanbwe's Royal Vessel. From there, he travelled downwards the Gungwa River, the sight of the High King's ship aweing both common travellers of the river, merchants and transport boats carrying goods around the Gungwa.\n\nWhen he arrived at Musangano's river port, the High King was given a warm welcome by the workers and other small-time vendors that were present when he arrived, along with other spectators and curious giraffes. Retikula had been instrumental in the expansion of Musangano's port, as industrial goods trade with the Kompels picked up in the late 900's, earning him positive opinion from the local populace. Retikula was also welcomed, of course, by Queen Rungano; with the Kingdom's army and its band providing the adequate musical ceremony.\n\nBoth monarchs, along with other guests, then both attended a more traditional festivals - with dancers and bowls filled with acacia fruits and vegetables, though the presence of newer, more exotic produce coming from other parts of Zebrica or even the world caught the High King's eye. Another highlight was Retikula meeting with the merchants of Musangano, many of which he had already talked with in the last weeks, when they attended the opening of the Grand Council in Twizanbwe. There, the High King repeated his gratitue to the merchants for the investment into the capital's reconstruction, and highlighted this and the efforts of other giraffes to improve Twizanyika's situation - with a phrase that has become the talking point of many in Musangano:"

 twizanyika.11.t:0 "The Agricultural Issue"
 twizanyika.11.d:0 "As the festival party in Musangano made it clear to the High King the moment he arrived in the city, the local landowners were indeed experimenting with new and exotic produce. Apples, in particular, were of great liking to Retikula.\n\nAll of this has led to an interesting proposal from some of these giraffes pioneering this effort. They asked for official support from the High King, with the promise of an even greater harvest next year, enough to satisfy the luxury needs of many giraffes. While Queen Rungano has herself lended her support to these landowners in their experiments, support from Retikula himself would go a long way to help these new farms grow, both figuratively and literally.\n\nWhile this would do wonders to diversify our agricultural production, there is also the concerns of both the landowners that still dedicate themselves to traditional acacia farming, and the farmers themselves. If we give our support to the pioneers, it is clear that we will anger the traditionalist giraffes, and vice-versa."
 twizanyika.11.a:0 "Favour the new crops."
 twizanyika.11.b:0 "Acacia farming will always be our staple."
 
 twizanyika.12.t:0 "The Trial Of Revai"
 twizanyika.12.d:0 "The issue of Revai, a merchant giraffe originally from Musangano, has become a national issue in a very short time. Revai was originally like many of the other traders of the city, making a profit off selling industrial goods bought from the Kompels, gradually expanding his business to a respectable size. However, everything turned sour for him as it was revealed that he had been smuggling these same goods to Matanda for the last years. The Matandan's, naturally, were outraged at this; and an official investigation was started by their authorities on Revai.\n\n After a lengthy and some say politically-motivated investigation ended, as Matanda has suffered from the increasing trade with the Kompels, a sentence was finally handed to Revai: death. This sentence was immediately met with anger from Musangano, and Revai's trial quickly turned into a national problem, as giraffes debate what should be done with him - if something should even be done.\n\nWith the discourse turning toxic, the arbitration of High King Retikula has been officially been requested, as a neutral voice in the problem. While Revai's crimes are undeniable, many feel that capital punishment is too harsh, and the issue of a politically-tainted court is a great weight on the legitimacy of it. Furthermore, Revai is popular with the common giraffe in Musangano, and his execution may anger them."
 twizanyika.12.a:0 "The sentence stands."
 twizanyika.12.b:0 "Commute the sentence."

 twizanyika.14.t:0 "Correspondence"
 twizanyika.14.d:0 ""Queen Rungano the Fifth, of Matanda. It has come to my attention that in the last days, the High King has refused to let any further development of new and innovative crops in your Kingdom; preventing it from any extra economic growth. In Matanda, too, we have been victim of a similar policy, with increasing centralization in Twizanbwe stopping the economic development of our lands and our people. With this shared struggle between our realms, it is fair that I ask you for your support in the Grand Council for a decrease in the Twizanbwe-centric decision making in Twizanyika. Signed, King Dzinashe III, of Matanda."\n\nA letter from the King of Matanda has arrived in Queen Rungano's court today, asking for her support in the Grand Council against the 'centralist' policies of Retikula. Dzinashe's concerns are legitimate, and Rungano's advisors and the Queen herself have grumbled in the last days over the High King's decision to stop crop development. Still, it is Rungano's ultimate responsibility whether to accept Dzinashe's request, or not."
 twizanyika.14.a:0 "Accept his request."
 twizanyika.14.b:0 "It would shake up things too much."
 
 twizanyika.15.t:0 "Exchanges"
 twizanyika.15.d:0 "It all started with a letter. Then two.\n\nFollowing the mining accident in the Kuchamhembe mountains, Rungano has been quick to denounce the bad judgement of the High King's advisors, who invited giraffes without any experience in deep mining or even adequate tools into the mountains. This caught the interest of King Dzinashe of Matanda, who was quick to establish a channel of letters and communication between the two Kingdoms. Both agreed that the situation of the common giraffe needs to be improved in order for Twizanyika to fully modernise.\n\nNow, Dzinashe has proposed these discussions to be officialized: given Rungano's experience in enacting modernising reforms, Dzinashe will call in the Grand Council for an official decision to enact a land reform programme in Twizanyika. All he needs is the support of Rungano in the Grand Council."
 twizanyika.15.a:0 "If he wants to."
 twizanyika.15.b:0 "Politely decline."
 
 twizanyika.16.t:0 "The Warning"
 twizanyika.16.d:0 "Today, a messenger arrived to the High King's court, bearing an urgent message from Queen Rungano of Musangano. In it, the Queen explained that King Dzinashe of Matanda has been contacting her in the past weeks, asking for her support in the Grand Council. While this would be generally curious, but not overly worrying, Rungano suspects that Dzinashe's aggressive contacting; as well as his now-cold attitude towards the High King, mean that the giraffe is planning to topple the Twinzanbwean dynasty from power.\n\nRetikula has suspected this as well, but from lack of any formal evidence he did not want to act on it - indeed, while Dzinashe's attitude towards the High King was cold, this was the rule rather than the exception with Matandan monarchs, who still held a certain resentment towards Twinzanbwe due to the First Twizanyikan War.\n\nIn any case, this message from Rungano has given us enough evidence to reinforce ourselves against any plots against the High King, and we expect Dzinashe's power to be lowered greatly in the coming days and weeks."
