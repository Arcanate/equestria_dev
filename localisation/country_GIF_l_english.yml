 ### Ideas ###
 
 GIF_repairing_twinzanbwe:0 "Repairing Twizanbwe"
 GIF_repairing_twinzanbwe_desc:0 "Following Boltrus' raid in 1002, large portions of the capital of Twizanbwe and its gold mines were damaged.

 GIF_trade_with_kompels:0 "Trade With The Kompels"

 ### Decisions ###
 
 GIF_dzinashi_coup:0 "The Plot"
 GIF_dzinashi_coup_desc:0 "High King Retikula, and especially the Twizanbwean dynasty, have proven that they have lost the capability to rule Twizanyika effectively. We have grown dependent on the griffons to the east, delaying our modernisation; and they have failed to protect their own capital from foreign raids, losing much wealth and prestige in the process. It is clear, that there is a need for a change in Twizanyika. And King Dzinashe III of Matanda is willing to be that change. He just needs to wait and slowly build his plot support - and then, strike.\n\n\nCurrent §Yplot power§!: [GIF.GetPlotPower]."
