 GIF_repairing_twinzanbwe:0 "Repairing Twizanbwe"
 GIF_repairing_twinzanbwe_desc:0 "Following Boltrus' raid in 1002, large portions of the capital of Twizanbwe and its gold mines were damaged. Since then, a monumental repair effort has been put in motion, costing us significantly. The Raid has also damaged the Twizanbwean dynasty’s prestige, making the efforts even more important."
 GIF_trade_with_kompels:0 "Trade With The Kompels"
 GIF_trade_with_kompels_desc:0 "Since the arrival of the griffon Kompels, Twizanyika has actively engaged in trade with them; particularly in industrial goods. This was mostly good for the giraffes until the Storm King’s wars disrupted trade routes northwards, and from there Twizanyika has entered into a more dependent relationship with the Kompels - delaying modernisation efforts."
 GIF_individual_armies:0 "The Kingdom's Armies"
 GIF_individual_armies_desc:0 "Twizanyika lacks a centralized military, instead relying on the armies of its individual Kingdoms and their vassals. While this worked in the past, and some giraffes may fight better for their homes, it is entirely unsuitable for the modern era."
