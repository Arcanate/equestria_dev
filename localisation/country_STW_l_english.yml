 STW_death_of_a_friend:0 "The Passing of Grover"
 STW_death_of_a_friend_desc:0 "With the passing of Grover V, events within the empire are about to unfold as the regency debate comes to the forefront of imperial politics. Still, this can wait as Gabriela take a moment to honour the passing of a close friend and family member. Backroom deals and power politics are for after she mourns the passing of a great Griffon."
 STW_pu_time:0 "Two Nations, One Ruler"
 STW_pu_time_desc:0 "The last few weeks have been a flurry of backroom deals, shifting alliances, and politics fought at the highest levels of imperial authority. However, Gabreila sits proud as the regent of Grover VI. Though, this does mean that she is de facto the ruler of two separate nations, a job that might be too much for even a hen of her stature."
 
 STW_choose_a_regent:0 "Gabriela’s Regent"
 STW_choose_a_regent_desc:0 "Gabriela’s duties keep her locked within Griffenheim, denying her homeland of sound judgement and leadership. With this in mind, she begins the process of finding a regent for her griffons."
 
 STW_commie_boy:0 "Ravenbeak von Schimmelpenninck"
 STW_commie_boy_desc:0 "Ravenbeak von Schimmelpenninck is minor noble who owns a smattering of land throughout Strawberry. He is a close friend and confidant of Gabriela, always offering a lucrative avenue of advice in her relation towards the working-class populace of her duchy. While some have expressed concern towards his republican and leftist views, the duchess expresses full faith in her friend."
 STW_pope_boy:0 "The Prelate of Osnabeak"
 STW_pope_boy_desc:0 "The Prelate of Osnabeak is currently filled by Julius Eagleclaw, Gabriela’s Uncle. While a staunchly religious griffon, he is an able administrator and has always showed great loyalty to his brother and later niece. However, some within our court question if this loyalty will continue to be upheld as Gabriela enters into direct conflict with the Archon."
 STW_loyalist:0 "Baroness Regina Eagleclaw"
 STW_loyalist_desc:0 "Baroness Regina Eagleclaw is a close cousin and friend of the duchess, being a trusted ally for the entirety of her reign. The two of them are like-minded in their harmonic beliefs, and with her in charge, there would be no doubt that Gabriella’s vision for Strawberry will be carried out diligently and with no hesitation."

 STW_forceful_cooperation:0 "For Strawberry"
 STW_forceful_cooperation_desc:0 "Our loyalty to the griffons of Strawberry trumps our loyalty to Gabriela. We must do everything in our power to ensure the security of our nation, and to accomplish such a goal, we must commit ourselves fully to modernizing our state."
 STW_combat_illiteracy:0 "Eradicate Illiteracy"
 STW_combat_illiteracy_desc:0 "Factory labour is not like other low wage work, it requires a bare minimum level of literacy in order to understand the operation of the complex machinery necessary for such enterprises. As such, if we wish to industrialize, we must first go about tackling the illiteracy which plagues our nation."
 STW_finish_illiteracy:0 "De Bezige Bij"
 STW_finish_illiteracy_desc:0 "Strawberry does not have a domestic printing industry, meaning we rely heavily upon foreign imports to stock our shelves and libraries. To address this, our government has established ‘De Bezige Bij’ a company which will print books by Strawberry’s authors, using Strawberry paper, for Strawberry markets. After all, without books how can we maintain literacy?"
 STW_start_modernisation:0 "Import Modern Equipment"
 STW_start_modernisation_desc:0 "From our factories to our farms, our workers toil using tools, machinery, and techniques which are decades behind the most advanced nations on the planet. In order to address this problem, our government must import machinery from foreign producers in order to help bridge this technological divide."
 STW_finished_modernisation_com_fash:0 "A Modern Nation"
 STW_finished_modernisation_com_fash_desc:0 "As Strawberry blazes into the 11th Century, it has made up much ground, bridging the gap towards full industrialization. Everyday more factories and workshops are opening within our cities as rural labour bloats our growing urban centres. It won’t be long before we stand as the beacon of modernity on the continent."
 STW_seize_land_for_the_industry:0 "Appropriate the Land of the Nobility"
 STW_seize_land_for_the_industry_desc:0 "The nobility of Strawberry still holds great tracks of land, running them in a very similar manner to their feudal forefather. This means that much of our economic potential is being artificially held back by mismanagement and greed. As such, we must seize these lands from the aristocracy and use them for the benefit of all griffons."
 STW_knights_of_Strawberry:0 "Knightly Tradition"
 STW_knights_of_Strawberry_desc:0 "Even in the face of modernization it is still important to hold onto certain archaic institutions. One such institution is the knighthood, a class of warriors who dedicate themselves to the protection of their lands. With a modernized twist a new generation of knights could be raised from the common populace to defend Strawberry valiantly from all threats."
 
 #Loyalist/Commie
 STW_reward_loyalty:0 "For Gabriela"
 STW_reward_loyalty_desc:0 "Our loyalty to Gabriela has ensured that the wealth and resources of Griffenheim will be offered to us in assisting with domestic issues. Chiefly this will come in the form of helping to address our rampant illiteracy and struggling manufacturing sector."
 STW_spread_books:0 "From the Griffenheim Presses"
 STW_spread_books_desc:0 "We can not hope to tackle illiteracy without books and other written material. Thankfully, the largest printing presses in Griffonia are located within Griffenheim. With their help, thousands of volumes will begin to flood our schools, libraries, and bookstores, offering our population access to books that would’ve been unheard of mere years ago."
 STW_expand_illiteracy_programs:0 "Griffenheim Educational Grants"
 STW_expand_illiteracy_programs_desc:0 "Books are good and all, but are useless if the Griffon doesn’t know how to read. In order to address this, we have requested imperial grants from Griffenheim in order to hire and pay the salaries of a new generation of teachers who will become the backbone of a non-secular ministry of education. Their work will do wonders in finally smashing illiteracy."
 STW_start_subsidies:0 "Industrial Subsidies"
 STW_start_subsidies_desc:0 "Strawberry’s infant industrial sector struggles against the might of Griffenheim’s, producing lower quality and more expensive products. With trade between our two regimes growing, it has become imperative that we subsidize these firms, using imperial grants, so they are able to compete on a more level playing field."
 STW_finished_modernisation_com_loyal:0 "Import Modern Agricultural Equipment"
 STW_finished_modernisation_com_loyal_desc:0 "Farming within Strawberry is handled in a very similar manner to what our ancestors did centuries ago, meaning that is labour intensive and inefficient. By importing modern equipment from Griffenheim, we can greatly increase the efficiency of our agricultural sector, freeing up labour to work in the burgeoning factories of Readewetter."
 STW_expand_the_industry_council:0 "Establish the Industry Council"
 STW_expand_the_industry_council_desc:0 "The Industry Council is an advisory board staffed by three domestic specialists and four specialists from Griffenheim. Their mission is to examine the feasibility of importing and implementing new industrial practices and technologies into the mills and factories of Griffenheim. It is hoped that with their help, Strawberry will be able to replicate the success of Griffenheim in modernizing."
 STW_FEA_cooperation:0 "Our Brothers"
 STW_FEA_cooperation_desc:0 "Feathisia has always been our brother nation, sharing a common history and language which binds our two peoples together. In this time of crisis, it is only appropriate that we approach our friends, looking to work together to overcome the conflict ahead."
 STW_join_the_zentralbank:0 "Strawberry’s Zentralbank"
 STW_join_the_zentralbank_desc:0 "When the Zentralbank collapsed, it brought down the entire Empire’s economy, shaking the common populace’s trust in banking. However, with the empire’s resurgence, under Gabriela, it has become feasible to reopen this institution, strengthening trade and commerce between the regimes still aligned with Griffenheim."
 STW_defenders_of_the_monarchy:0 "Defence Against the Archon"
 STW_defenders_of_the_monarchy_desc:0 "Strawberry stands as a bulwark, aligned behind Gabriella’s Griffenheim. In the event of war our homeland could become a battleground and the citizens of our duchy must stand ready to sacrifice in the name of our righteous cause."
 
 #Loyalist
 STW_two_nations_one_ruler:0 "An Independent Strawberry?"
 STW_two_nations_one_ruler_desc:0 "With Gabriela’s authority over the Griffon Empire solidified there has been a raging debate amongst our nobles over the future of Strawberry. Some have proposed that we remain independent of Griffenheim, maintaining the status quo enjoyed for generations. On the other talon, there are those who think a merger of our two regimes would offer us the brightest and most peaceful future."
 STW_closer_cooperation:0 "Embrace Griffenheim"
 STW_closer_cooperation_desc:0 "At Gabriela’s instruction, Regina has embarked upon the long process of opening up Strawberry to further imperial administration. While the initial phase is little more than promise-making, it is still a necessary first step in unifying our two regimes."
 STW_special_snowflake:0 "Distance Ourselves"
 STW_special_snowflake_desc:0 "While we do appreciate warm relationships with Griffenheim it is important to remember that we are a separate entity from the empire, regardless of who our ruler may be. So, against the wishes of Gabriela, we must make it known that we will remain firm in our independence."
 STW_economical_cooperation:0 "Economic Cooperation"
 STW_economical_cooperation_desc:0 "Strawberry is a land rich in raw resources but poor in industry. Meanwhile, Griffenheim is poor in resources but rich in industry. By unifying our economies, we not only take a necessary step in tying together our regimes but also offer a lucrative trade arrangement which can benefit both of our nations."
 STW_leave_me_alone:0 "Separate but United"
 STW_leave_me_alone_desc:0 "While we have distanced ourselves from Griffenheim, it doesn’t mean that our regime is unloyal to Gabriela or flagging in her cause. As such, we must make a statement assuring the empire that we stand united with our duchess and are committed to her cause of unifying the empire once again."
 STW_open_communications:0 "No Secrets Between Friends"
 STW_open_communications_desc:0 "With Gabriela’s command of both nations, she has asked for a greater degree of transparency between the ministers of both, allowing our government a greater insight into the affairs of Griffenheim and the empire as a whole."
 STW_mutual_benefits:0 "Equalization Payments"
 STW_mutual_benefits_desc:0 "The wealth of the empire flows into Griffenheim, greatly enriching the city and its surrounding provinces. While Strawberry is by no means poor, a system of equalization payments made from Griffenheim to Readewetter could help smooth over lingering economic inequalities that might hinder integration."
 STW_diplomatical_missions:0 "Little Sister Diplomacy"
 STW_diplomatical_missions_desc:0 "Strawberry has very much become the little sister to the Empire, meaning we have an important role to play as a moderating voice in foreign affairs. Where Griffenheim might not be able to afford tact and level-headedness, we can come in and mediate and a more diplomatic solution."
 STW_economical_integration:0 "Economic Integration"
 STW_economical_integration_desc:0 "Growing trade between Strawberry and the Empire has greatly benefited both sides. Though, it has also created a dependency, with Griffenheim factories relying on Strawberry’s iron, coal, and minerals, while Strawberry merchants rely on the goods of Griffenheim’s factories. As such, it’s about time that we invested in formalizing the integration of our two economies to ensure no disruptions occur."
 STW_an_unique_position:0 "A Unique Opportunity"
 STW_an_unique_position_desc:0 "As the crisis draws ever closer, the forges and factories of Griffenheim have gone into overdrive, producing the weapons and equipment needed to arm the growing Imperial Army. With our vast mineral and resource deposits, we are in a prime position to profit from this military build up. Who isn’t game for a little war profiteering?"
 STW_a_choice:0 "The Readewetter Accord"
 STW_a_choice_desc:0 "The Readewetter Accord is a formal declaration signed between Griffenheim and Readewetter, stating that the Empire will respect Strawberry’s sovereignty and independence in exchange for industrial support, their loyalty and service in the upcoming civil war. "
 STW_appoint_new_counts:0 "New Ducal Administration"
 STW_appoint_new_counts_desc:0 "In Gabriela’s absence, the administration of Strawberry has fallen to corrupt bureaucrats and civil servants appointed based on bribery and connections. In order to ensure the duchy’s prosperity and survival, we must replace these incompetent individuals with qualified and abled griffons."
 STW_a_nobles_nation:0 "The Strawberry of Old"
 STW_a_nobles_nation_desc:0 "Strawberry has always stood as a bulwark of noble privilege and the old way of griffon life. Through the sound leadership of Regina Eagleclaw, Gabriela’s vision for her griffons has been maintained and a stable future has been envisioned."
 
 #Commies
 STW_socialism:0 "Memory of the Republic"
 STW_socialism_desc:0 "While the Republican Uprising failed, their temporary occupation and administration of Strawberry’s lands did foster the first embers of republican ideology. While these have long been stamped out, all it will take is a little spark to reignite the smolder."
 STW_the_people_rule:0 "Expand Political Rights"
 STW_the_people_rule_desc:0 "Strawberry is an absolute monarchy, with the only griffons with any political power being Gabriela, her regent, and a small cliché of advisors and ministers. This is not the way to run a modern nation. What Strawberry needs is an elected Ducal Assembly where griffons can vote in representatives to promote their interests."
 STW_we_are_the_people:0 "First Among Equals"
 STW_we_are_the_people_desc:0 "A strong central government is required in order to enact the various reforms necessary to modernize our duchy. While some might call this undemocratic, there have been many republics, which in times of crisis, have appointed strong executive councils to manage the state in such times."
 STW_some_are_more_equal:0 "The Grand Pensionary"
 STW_some_are_more_equal_desc:0 "Before the Eagleclaw clan completely assumed control over the Duchy of Strawberry, they were merely the Counts of Readewetter and the Stadtholders of Starclaw, Winterbell, and Osnabeak. In times of succession, a Grand Pensionary would be appointed to administer these various domains until a new Stadtholder was picked. With Gabriella’s absence, it is time for the first in 200 years."
 STW_all_are_equal:0 "Expand Civil Liberties"
 STW_all_are_equal_desc:0 "In a modern nation there are certain rights which are bestowed upon all citizens of the realm. The freedom of speech, the freedom to move freely, and equal representation before the law being chief among them. As such, it is the duty of our regency to bestow our griffons with these most natural of rights."
 STW_planned_economy:0 "Planned Economy"
 STW_planned_economy_desc:0 "The problems of Strawberry’s economy are unique and can not be properly resolved by relying upon the invisible talons of capital nor the markets. Instead, we must assume direct control over our industrial enterprises and manage them through government ministry and administrators. Only then can we ensure maximum efficiency."
 STW_small_business:0 "Break the Monopolies"
 STW_small_business_desc:0 "Within Strawberry, many goods and services are controlled by monopolistic firms and guilds who exert a huge amount of control over supply and pricing. In order to address this issue, we must break up the largest of these firms and sell off their assets to smaller firms, allowing for fair competition to take effect."
 STW_a_workers_nation:0 "Expand Social Rights"
 STW_a_workers_nation_desc:0 "As the wealth of Strawberry increases it becomes imperative that the worker’s who toil to create it are rewarded by their state. The freedom from hunger, homelessness, and impoverishment are a revolutionary concept but one which our nation must embrace if we are to become a true beacon of liberty and prosperity in the world."
 STW_socialist_intelligence:0 "Socialist Education"
 STW_socialist_intelligence_desc:0 "Throughout the Griffonian continent many of the working class can not afford to even supply their chicks with a basic education, hampering social and economic development. In Strawberry we will adopt a different approach, offering subsidized education all the way though to university for students who are capable and willing."
 STW_better_red_than_dead:0 "Schimmelpenninck’s Strawberry"
 STW_better_red_than_dead_desc:0 "The Strawberry of today is different from that of a mere decade ago. Our populace has been empowered, our economy prospers, and a rich system of social safety nets protect the poor from destitution. And it is all thanks to the dedication and hard work of Ravenbeak von Schimmelpenninck."
 
 #Pope Boy
 STW_voluentary_loyalty:0 "Secret Talks"
 STW_voluentary_loyalty_desc:0 "Gabriela is misguided, attempting to take action against the rightful regent of the empire. While, Julius loves his niece greatly he must do what his faith and morals oblige him. As such, he will attempt to make contact with the Archon and pledge assistance in the upcoming conflict."
 STW_recognise_the_three:0 "Recognise the Three"
 STW_recognise_the_three_desc:0 "The Council of Three is the only hope the Empire has to do away with the parasitic and unholy aristocracy which drain Griffenheim of its vigour and pollute the land with sin. As such, we must make it known, within appropriate circles, that we recognize this Council as the legitimate regency body."
 STW_the_knights_guard:0 "Align the Royal Guard"
 STW_the_knights_guard_desc:0 "Gabriela’s royal guard has languished for years, withering away under budgetary restraints and mismanagement. This has made them a prime target for our administration. With a few promises of payment and restoration of glory, the Royal Guard can become the backbone of Strawberry’s own branch of the Knights of Arcturius."
 STW_suck_pope_dick:0 "Approach the Archon"
 STW_suck_pope_dick_desc:0 "As our administration becomes more in line with the Archon’s faction, it’s about time that we send a delegation to him and make official contact. We will require his guidance in the months to come as we make the move towards breaking away from Gabriela."
 STW_a_commoners_man:0 "The Commoners"
 STW_a_commoners_man_desc:0 "During the regency crisis, the Archon attempted to align the common class against Gabriella. While dashed in these efforts, he did prove the latent political force that could be mobilized within the common populace. As such, we must make efforts to remind Strawberry’s working class of their obligations to their gods rather than their duchess."
 STW_industrialisation:0 "Invest the Tithes"
 STW_industrialisation_desc:0 "Strawberry’s industrial base has fallen on hard times, rocked by the economic instability which plagues the continent. However, as we move away from Griffenheim we must establish an economy that can stand independent of the imperial city. As such, we must invest church tithes into propping up struggling industrial enterprises and opening up new ones."
 STW_a_religious_man:0 "Holy Administration"
 STW_a_religious_man_desc:0 "Strawberry’s administration has languished in Gabriella’s absence with her corrupt ministers often appointing government officials based on family connections, favours, or good old fashion bribery. We must do away with these inefficient and incompetent individuals, replacing them with able bodied officials from the church."
 STW_our_own_nation:0 "Independence"
 STW_our_own_nation_desc:0 "The time has come to breakaway from Gabriela’s regency and pledge our full and public support to the Archon’s cause. While we are far from his power base in the south, our forces will prove a valuable asset in opening up a two-front war against the corrupt nobles in Griffenheim. We love thee Gabriela, but we love our gods more."
 STW_our_own_empire:0 "Strawberry Stands Strong"
 STW_our_own_empire_desc:0 "Free of the Gabriela’s influence, Strawberry has been allowed to prosper under the guidance of Julius Eagleclaw and the Archon. What stands before us is a powerful and modern nation which is ready to meet all threats to our cause, may they be domestic or foreign."
 STW_stab_the_opposition:0 "Decrease the Opposition"
 STW_stab_the_opposition_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts to show others the greatness of the Archon, some will not be swayed. A few supporters have found more rigorous methods of keeping the population in line with our ideals."

 STW_uni_readewetter:0 "The University of Readewetter"
 STW_uni_readewetter_desc:0 "The premier educational centre within Strawberry, the University of Readewetter offers the duchy’s best science and legal faculties. With a bit of financing and governmental support, this institution could rise to be amongst the greatest in the entire Empire."
 STW_uni_starclaw:0 "The University of Starclaw"
 STW_uni_starclaw_desc:0 "The University of Starclaw has always played second fiddle to that in Readewetter. However, with a duchy renown theology and social science department, this university could be made to shine with proper investment and government influence."
 
 ### Eagleclaw in STW
 STW_sidelined:0 "Imperial Exile"
 STW_sidelined_desc:0 "With the Archon’s ascendancy to regent, Duchess Eagleclaw has been expelled from the Royal Court in Griffenheim. However, with her return to Readewetter, she won’t remain idle for long, already looking to tackle her nation’s domestic and foreign policy issues in order to pool together support for her claim to the regency."
 STW_ties_with_other_nations:0 "Allies Abroad"
 STW_ties_with_other_nations_desc:0 "Our own Duchy is pitiful when compared to the entire might of the Empire. However, there are regimes friendly to our cause amongst many of the imperial states. Plus, regimes beyond the imperial boundaries might be swayed to invest in the cause of having a sound-minded regent guarding the emperor."
 STW_hidden_resistance:0 "Spit Behind His Back"
 STW_hidden_resistance_desc:0 "While resistance to the Archon is important, we must be cautious in how transparent we are on this stance. After all, the Archon wields the Empire’s might and could easily quash the embers of resistance forming against him. However, this secrecy would make it harder to rally support behind our banner."
 STW_open_resistance:0 "Spit in His Face"
 STW_open_resistance_desc:0 "We are a proud and independent duchy within the Griffon Empire and we can not allow Griffenheim to dictate our policies. No, we must stand proud and shout our resistance to the Archon, making it know that there are griffons who will not abide by his tyranny. While this will make us a target, it would also make it easier to coordinate and find allies."
 STW_gather_arms:0 "Gather Arms"
 STW_gather_arms_desc:0 "Political support is important but it alone will not win this coming crisis. No, we must stand ready to arm our populace in the event of war. However, to support such an army, we will require sufficient quantities of guns, bullets, shells, and other equipment."
 STW_sway_the_griff_nobles:0 "Align the Nobility"
 STW_sway_the_griff_nobles_desc:0 "The nobility is what really rules the Griffon Empire. Without their continued support, the apparatuses of the imperial bureaucracy would grind to a halt, finding themselves without skilled labour and local legitimacy. By bring the nobility in line with our agenda, we would severely undermine the authority and power of the Archon."
 STW_approach_the_griff_commoners:0 "Align the Commoners"
 STW_approach_the_griff_commoners_desc:0 "In his rush to power, the Archon mobilized the support of the common populace to terrifying effect. This has proven the importance of bringing the common classes in line with our political agenda. If we were able to bring them into our camp, we’d be robbing the Archon of one of his most vital sources of power."
 STW_strike_the_archon:0 "Purge the Taint from Arcturius"
 STW_strike_the_archon_desc:0 "The Archons have sullen the name and legacy of Griffonia for far too long, sitting as a virtual emperor in Griffenheim. It is our duty, as true rulers of Griffonia, to strike down the pretenders. Only then can Strawberry, and the Empire, overcome this era of crisis, and prosper."
 STW_social_reform:0 "A Modern Strawberry"
 STW_social_reform_desc:0 "In Eagleclaw’s absence, Strawberry has been allowed to languish, entering a period of political and social stagnation. Feudalism, a medieval court system, corrupt guilds, archaic education, and indifferent advisors plague our nation, holding us back from modernizing and making us fragile in the face of the Archon."
 STW_visit_public_schools:0 "Modernize our Legal Text"
 STW_visit_public_schools_desc:0 "Much of Strawberry’s legal text was drafted in the early days of the duchy. This has created many problems, including the accumulation of laws no longer considered justice, the absence of laws regulating modern institutions, and all around a confusing literature which makes the practice of law timely and costly. With this in mind, we must rewrite and modernize Strawberry’s legal text."
 STW_start_reading_programs:0 "The Ministry of Education"
 STW_start_reading_programs_desc:0 "An educated populace is a modern populace. It has been proven that a nation with high literacy is easily able to industrialize and adapt to changes in the world. As such, addressing gaps in basic literacy must be of the upmost importance to our administration. To aid in this, Eagleclaw has established a dedicated governmental organization with the duty of modernizing education."
 STW_economic_ties:0 "Break the Guilds"
 STW_economic_ties_desc:0 "The medieval guilds are a holdover from a simpler time. However, their monopolistic control over certain vital trades have stagnated the Strawberry economy. By breaking the guilds, and liberalizing the trade of such goods, we would see immediate benefit within our infant industrial sector."
 STW_modernisation_effort:0 "Remove Archaic Advisors"
 STW_modernisation_effort_desc:0 "With Eagleclaw’s absence, the appointment of advisors to high-ranking position usually fell to the talons of regents who were looking to line their pockets or reward political allies. As such, there have been several questionable appointments in recent years. Now that the Duchess has returned, we can go about removing these individuals and appoint new advisors based on merit."
 STW_a_modern_nation:0 "Shatter Feudalism"
 STW_a_modern_nation_desc:0 "Our recent modernization efforts have led to this, the complete overthrow of the feudal apparatus. While this system has been vital to our state, the instruments of this archaic system have kept many griffons trapped on rural and agricultural estates. In order for a modern industrial Strawberry to shine, this system must be overthrown."
 STW_political_reform:0 "Return of the Duchess"
 STW_political_reform_desc:0 "The Duchess’ absence has been felt by much of her domain, creating a general sense of apathy towards the crown and her cause. Any efforts to seize the regency will go nowhere without the support of our populace. As such, we must attempt to bridge this disconnect and rebuild the trust and respect of the Duchess in the eyes of her griffons."
 STW_the_duchess_speech:0 "The Duchess' Speech"
 STW_the_duchess_speech_desc:0 "‘Today my voice is carried by radio waves to your homes. To be allowed this privilege, I have exploited the copper of Bronzehill, the timber of Angriver, and components manufactured in Feathisia. All of which have came together to be assembled in the heart of our empire, Griffenheim. This radio is but an example of the good our unified empire can bring, a unity currently threatened by the Archon.’"
 STW_royal_tours:0 "The Royal Tour"
 STW_royal_tours_desc:0 "Outside of Readewetter, many towns have failed to receive attention from the crown, having gone generations without an official visit. This issue has only been exacerbated by the Duchess’ absence, creating a tension between the rural and urban citizenry. To remedy this, we have planned a pan-Strawberry road trip, bringing the Duchess to these long-ignored regions."
 STW_a_series_of_decrees:0 "The Royal Decrees"
 STW_a_series_of_decrees_desc:0 "Where the radio is non-existent, nor the populace great enough to support the roads necessary for our tour, there are still griffons who are our subjects. We must make some effort to reach these most isolated communities and remind them that they are a part of our crown and domains. To attempt this, air craft have been contracted to drop leaflets on these communities."
 STW_one_nation_against_the_archon:0 "One Nation United"
 STW_one_nation_against_the_archon_desc:0 "Our populace stands united at our back and the last vestiges of the Archon’s influence have been purged from our lands.

 STW_expand_the_royal_guard:0 "Expand the Royal Guard"
 STW_expand_the_royal_guard_desc:0 "For years, the royal guard has continued to shrink in scope, decaying to only a small bodyguard unit that protects the Duchess. In the past however, this organization once acted as the eyes and ears of the crown, with their presence a constant knife in the backs of griffons who wished to harm our duchy."
 STW_root_out_archon_supporters:0 "The List"
 STW_root_out_archon_supporters_desc:0 "Within our nation, there are griffons who feel a greater sense of devotion towards their church than their duchess. These griffons are a threat to our sovereignty, a fifth column which will attempt to dethrone us in the face of the Archon. As such, we must use our newly empowered royal guard to root out these zealots and remove them before they can become a threat."
 STW_a_grandiose_party:0 "A Grandiose Party"
 STW_a_grandiose_party_desc:0 "The nation has finally begun to warm to the return of the Duchess. However, her efforts have left the nobility of Strawberry largely ignored. As such, it is imperative that we remedy this slight before it is allowed to fester into anything serious. To do this, we will host a grand banquet in the royal palace with the entirety of Strawberry’s upper crust invited to attend."
 STW_center_of_learning:0 "Expand the University of Readewetter"
 STW_center_of_learning_desc:0 "Facilities at the University of Readewetter are woefully underequipped for dealing with the potential influx of students the campus is likely to experience in coming years. With this in mind, we must expand this renowned facility, creating additional classrooms, hiring new professors, and pledging greater funds to the sciences."
 STW_strawberry_rules_archons_fucking_dead:0 "Gabriella’s Regency"
 STW_strawberry_rules_archons_fucking_dead_desc:0 "With the fall of the Archon, Gabriella Eagleclaw has seized her rightful claim to the regency of Grover VI. This will usher in a bright new future for the Griffon Empire, as her fair and just leadership will help modernize it, while pacifying and moderating relations abroad. Truly, this marks the beginning of a new era for all griffons."
 
 ### Industry
 STW_industry_start:0 "The Second Industrial Revolution"
 STW_industry_start_desc:0 "Industrialization has been slow to reach Griffonia, with our own nation only experiencing the first vestiges. However, our lands are rich in coal, iron, and oil, and to properly exploit this we must invest in a new era of heavy manufacturing that will make us the pride of the Empire."

 STW_move_to_the_city_desc:0 "Our capital is the thriving heart of the Strawberry Duchy, housing the majority of our industrial development. However, there is room to expand and turn the city into a crowning industrial jewel for the Empire. However, such a dream will not come cheap and will require much investment on our behalf."

 STW_support_big_business_desc:0 "We offer land and a skilled workforce, however industrial investment has been slow to trickle in, making our dreamed industrialization a slow crawl. However, our administration has begun a bold plan of tax reform and subsidies, helping to prop up domestic firms, which might just need a little extra help to compete on the world stage."
 STW_money_for_the_nobles:0 "Sell Duchy Lands"
 STW_money_for_the_nobles_desc:0 "Large swathes of rural land remain under the Duchy’s jurisdiction, generating a meagre profit in terms of rent and agricultural surplus. By selling these lands to interested nobles, we can generate significant revenues which can then be invested into Readewetter, offering a far more lucrative business opportunity for our administration."
 STW_privatisation_railway:0 "All Roads Lead to Readewetter"
 STW_privatisation_railway_desc:0 "The vast resources of the countryside struggle to reach Readewetter, denying our mills, factories, and enterprises the wealth of our nation. By working in tandem with private firms, we can ensure that the infrastructure needed to tap into these vast resources is developed, allowing for the cheaper flow of goods into our capital and heart of the economy."
 STW_start_resource_projects:0 "Eastern Investment"
 STW_start_resource_projects_desc:0 "Our three eastern provinces are rich in natural resources. However, our infrastructure and investment in this region is rather lackluster, meaning that the mines and oilfields of the east are running at only a fraction of their potential capacity. By investing in this region, we can ensure a greater quantity of industrial resources to fuel the rapidly growing demand within Readewetter."
 STW_military_industrial_complex:0 "The Military-Industrial Complex"
 STW_military_industrial_complex_desc:0 "In modern war we can not rely upon a few government firms to provide the equipment of our military in prolonged engagements. Instead, we must call upon our civilian sector to come to our aid, providing their industrial assets to the nation, allowing us to produce guns, bullets, tanks, and planes at a rate that would’ve been unimaginable even a decade earlier."
 STW_electronics_focus:0 "The Era of Electronics"
 STW_electronics_focus_desc:0 "The radio has revolutionized mass communication, allowing for a message to be carried to thousands of griffons simultaneously. For years, we have imported foreign radios into our nation, creating a reliance upon manufacturers in Griffenheim. To break this dependency, our firms must adopt the mission of developing, designing, and producing our own domestic variant."
 STW_create_new_industrial_parks:0 "A New Readewetter"
 STW_create_new_industrial_parks_desc:0 "Readewetter has become the crowning jewel of industrialization that our nation needed. However, the city is taped with further development becoming an increasingly costly endeavour. However, the other cities of the Duchy are chomping at the bit to witness a similar change in their fortune. What city will become the next Readewetter?"
 STW_invite_magical_one_horns:0 "Import Equestrian Expertise"
 STW_invite_magical_one_horns_desc:0 "Equestria has thrived through its industrial revolution, offering a shining example of the wonders to come to our great nation. Along with this example, they have also trained and given experience to a wide range of economists, engineers, technicians, and managers. By importing this talent into our nation, we can ensure that we don’t have to 'reinvent the wheel' with our industrialization."
 STW_encourage_construction:0 "Construction Boom"
 STW_encourage_construction_desc:0 "The growth of Readewetter, in recent years, has sponsored a wave of construction, which has employed and trained thousands of griffons in the field. Their expertise has proven vital in aiding the rapid development of our capital and outlying regions."
 #Commie/Fash
 STW_support_the_farms:0 "Modernize Agriculture"
 STW_support_the_farms_desc:0 "The countryside of the Duchy has long been neglected, left in the hands of a semi-feudal system of large-scale noble estate exploiting unlanded poor. Not only is this system inefficient at producing food but it also locks a large pool of potential labour within the fields of the Duchy. By investing in modern agricultural techniques, we can begin to do away with this system and modernize."
 STW_workers_rights:0 "The Ministry of Labour"
 STW_workers_rights_desc:0 "Industrialized economies have a delicate balancing act to follow, where the interests of craftgriffs must be weighed against the profits of investors. By creating a dedicated Ministry of Labour, we can appoint a minister to oversee labour relations and ensure that labour disruptions and worker abuses are kept to an absolute minimum."
 STW_7_hour_workday:0 "The 8 Hour Workday"
 STW_7_hour_workday_desc:0 "‘8 hours of work, 8 hours of rest, and 8 hours of leisure' has been a rallying call amongst our urban workforce for awhile now, fostering a rather vocal interest in the subject. By passing a law, mandating this practice, we will assuredly win favour from the working populace within our cities."
 STW_seize_noble_lands:0 "Breakup Noble Estates"
 STW_seize_noble_lands_desc:0 "While investments in modernizing agriculture have made some inroads in addressing the social issues of the countryside, the lingering structures left by the previous semi-feudal system still linger. As such, we must begin to acquire noble estates and begin the process of breaking them apart and dolling them out to the populace, ensuring that they are managed far more effectively."
 STW_expand_mines:0 "Exploit our Mineral Wealth"
 STW_expand_mines_desc:0 "The great mines of Drawftail and Starclaw are prosperous to our populace. However, they are operated at only a fraction of their potential capacity. By expanding our operations, we can drastically increase our supply of iron, coal, and other strategically vital assets."
 STW_drill_for_oil:0 "Exploit Osnabeak"
 STW_drill_for_oil_desc:0 "The great plains of Osnabeak are marked by rows of oil derricks, pumping crude and natural gas out of the ground. However, the region still has a vast reserve of resources just waiting to be exploited. By investing in additional infrastructure and equipment, we can vastly increase our supply and help meet Imperial demands for generations."
 STW_nationalize_rail:0 "Connect the Countryside"
 STW_nationalize_rail_desc:0 "Outside of Readewetter, our nation is connected by a series of fragile rail lines, poorly paved roads, and dirt paths. This severely limits our economy, making the transportation of goods a dangerous, difficult, and costly endeavour. By investing in upgrades to our infrastructure network, we can increase the connectivity of the countryside to Readewetter, greatly benefiting our economy."
 STW_more_guns:0 "Decentralize the Arms Industry"
 STW_more_guns_desc:0 "Growing connectivity to the countryside has allowed us to move industry outside of the city of Readewetter. By doing this, we can decentralize our arms industry, ensuring that our war effort would be allowed to endure even if our capital was to be bombed or captured by hostile factions. While less efficient, it’s a safety net we’ll greatly benefit from in the event of war."
 STW_investagation_electronics:0 "Readewetter I"
 STW_investagation_electronics_desc:0 "Electrical Engineers at the University of Readewetter have designed a machine which can complete basic arithmetic. Dubbed Readewetter, this initial machine might seem rather simplistic, but the designers promise, that with proper funding, such a device could prove to be the future of mathematics, performing calculations beyond what mere griffons could ever hope to achieve."
 STW_large_scale_construction:0 "Taming Nature"
 STW_large_scale_construction_desc:0 "Raging rivers and rugged mountains, these issues plague development within our Duchy. However, with our pool of labour growing, we can begin an extensive public works project to bring nature to heel, controlling our vast rivers and harsh landscape so that it may benefit our griffons in the future."
 
  ### Military
 STW_military_shit:0 "Memory of Rotten Rift"
 STW_military_shit_desc:0 "A decade ago, forces of the Imperial and Strawberry armies coordinated a raid on republican assets in the region of Rotten Rift. The attack ended in disaster, with our combined forces being routed and driven back into Feathesia. While a humiliation, this assault provided some much-needed lessons in modern warfare to our army."
 STW_modern_military:0 "The Army of the 11th Century"
 STW_modern_military_desc:0 "Our infantry uses breach loaded rifles, our artillery corp is antiquated, and motorization is almost non-existent. If we hope to stand talon to talon with the cream of the imperial crop, we must modernize our forces and verse them in the realities of modern war."
 STW_support_divisions:0 "The Strawberry Corp of Engineers"
 STW_support_divisions_desc:0 "Engineers will play a critical role in the upcoming war, fulfilling many roles. They are the repairers of combat vehicles, the destroyers of fortified strongpoints, the designers of trenches, and the builders of bridges. With this in mind its about time that we created a dedicate branch of the military to train and facilitate their needs."
 STW_big_guns:0 "Modernize the Artillery Corp"
 STW_big_guns_desc:0 "Over the last century, the role of artillery has become increasingly important within war. Without it, a modern army can not advance lest they take horrifying causalities. As such, we must ensure that Strawberry does not lag behind in either artillery production or technological innovation."
 STW_griff_tech:0 "Revolutionize the Griffon"
 STW_griff_tech_desc:0 "Griffons are predators with claws and beaks that could cut through flesh and bone. There is much combat efficiency to be gained if we could harness this predatory force and weaponize the very natural advantages bestowed upon us."
 STW_new_guns_n_shit:0 "Modern Small Arms"
 STW_new_guns_n_shit_desc:0 "In the event of war our army will need every advantage it can get its talons on. A cheap means of achieving this is by ensuring that our riflegriffs are equipped with the most modern and lethal of small arms."
 STW_radar:0 "An Equestrian Revolution"
 STW_radar_desc:0 "RADAR is an Equestrian technology which allows them to detect airborne threats from hundreds of kilometers away, giving them plenty of time to scramble an intercepting force and protect their airspace. It would be very beneficial for us to get our talons on this technology."
 #Commie/Fash
 STW_more_bodies_is_good:0 "Irontalon Doctrine"
 STW_more_bodies_is_good_desc:0 "Jillian Irontalon is the chief proponent of what has been dubbed the realists doctrine of warfare. She acknowledges that Strawberry’s industrial capabilities are lacking and as such we will be unable to facilitate total war. With this in mind, she wants to focus her military upon infantry, which she views as less of a burden upon our arms industry and logistics."
 STW_fresh_feathers:0 "Ducal Draft"
 STW_fresh_feathers_desc:0 "It’s been decades since the duchy has initiated a draft. However, as the threat of war within the empire looms, it has become apparent that our military is too small, in its current state, to handle the might of the imperial war machine. As such, we must call upon every able-bodied griffons within our nation to come to its aid."
 STW_even_more_guns:0 "Standardize the Rifle"
 STW_even_more_guns_desc:0 "Currently, our military is employing a wide range of weaponry. This has created a huge supply issue, as all manner of calibres are required to keep our forces in peak condition. In order to address this, we must select a single model of rifle and make it standard issue for all Strawberry forces, hopefully addressing this problem."
 STW_light_tanks:0 "Tankettes"
 STW_light_tanks_desc:0 "We are not ignorant to the advances of modern warfare and acknowledge the need for mechanized and armoured forces. However, with our poor industrial base, which should focus upon less resource intensive models, using these primarily as infantry support vehicles and within rapid response units."
 STW_some_towed_arty:0 "The New Role of Artillery"
 STW_some_towed_arty_desc:0 "The increasing efficiency of small arms has greatly enhanced the defensibility and killing potential of even modest infantry formations. In response, our military must focus upon the inclusion of a greater concentration of artillery into its formations to break up and neutralize these potential threats."
 STW_defences_against_everyone_who_isnt_the_empire:0 "Remember an Old Threat"
 STW_defences_against_everyone_who_isnt_the_empire_desc:0 "The Griffon Republic stands to our Northwest. While they have been mostly silent since their fall, they are still a threat to the security of Strawberry and the Empire. So even as civil conflict within the Empire looks increasingly likely, we must fortify and secure this hostile border."
 STW_defences_against_the_empire:0 "The Osnabeak Line"
 STW_defences_against_the_empire_desc:0 "The thought of internal imperial defenses was foreign until mere months ago. Now as the threat of an intra-imperial war looks increasingly likely, we must ensure that our southern border is secured against the threat of imperial intervention."
 STW_more_guns_is_good:0 "Eagleclaw Doctrine"
 STW_more_guns_is_good_desc:0 "Gene Eagleclaw is a cousin of the duchess and main proponent of what has been dubbed the idealist doctrine of warfare. While he admits that Strawberry’s industrial base is lacking, he predicts that with his cousin’s reforms the nation will soon be able to facilitate modern war. With this in mind, he wishes to focus upon well equipped and highly mobile task forces at the core of our military."
 #Loyalist/Eagleclaw
 STW_better_guns_is_good:0 "Invest in a New Infantry Rifle"
 STW_better_guns_is_good_desc:0 "While the number of griffons killed by small arms is tiny compared to those taken out by artillery, we should not underestimate the importance of such weapons. By investing in a new generation of small arms, we could have a very potent edge upon our enemies, allowing us to dominate the battlefield."
 STW_support_weapons:0 "Non-Combatant Roles"
 STW_support_weapons_desc:0 "The growing complexity of modern warfare has spawned a whole generation of military personal who will likely never see combat. These include engineers, medics, truck drivers, radio operators, and mechanics. While their duties take them away from the battlefield their role is no less important than that of the riflegriff."
 STW_medium_tanks:0 "The Eagleclaw"
 STW_medium_tanks_desc:0 "Armoured combat will play a critical role in modern war, acting as the spearhead of mobile armies. They are vital in breaking through hostile defenses and allowing for the infantry to pour through the breach and invade enemy territory. With this in mind, we need to invest into a modern tank to fulfill such a role."
 STW_special_forces:0 "Expand the Special Forces"
 STW_special_forces_desc:0 "What we lack in raw numbers we can make up for with quality training and equipment. Amongst our many battalions we should set aside a small number and provide them with specialized training which will make them adapt at fighting within the rugged mountainous terrain of Strawberry."
 STW_modern_magical_arms:0 "Collaborate with Bronzehill"
 STW_modern_magical_arms_desc:0 "The mountains of Bronzehill are rich with crystal charged with magical energy. It has been theorized for a while now that this energy could be harvested for all sorts of purposes. Most important of which is that it could be used within new, energy-based, weaponry which would put traditional small arms to shame in terms of killing potential."
 
 ### Airforce
 STW_modernise_airfields:0 "Airport Construction Grants"
 STW_modernise_airfields_desc:0 "The prospect of air travel within Strawberry is nonexistent, leading to our nation lagging behind Griffonia in this regard. By subsidizing the duchy’s various large towns, we can begin a programme of aerial infrastructure development. In the event of war these sites could be used as bases for the burgeoning Strawberry Air Force"
 STW_hire_new_officers:0 "Contract Foreign Advisors"
 STW_hire_new_officers_desc:0 "While aerial combat is not cutting-edge territory for griffonkind, what is new is the use of airplanes in conducting it. Thankfully, other nations have been dealing with this for decades now and a pool of potential advisors is available for us to hire."
 STW_refresh_doctrine:0 "Develop Doctrine"
 STW_refresh_doctrine_desc:0 "Like any other branch of the armed forces, the physical griffons and their equipment are only half the battle in conducting successful operations. As such, we must begin to draft a doctrine for our air force, allowing us a set of tactics and strategic plans in the events of actual combat."
 STW_anti_planes_planes_focus:0 "Defend Readewetter"
 STW_anti_planes_planes_focus_desc:0 "In the event of war, it is likely that the imperial army will deploy its own air force to strike at Strawberry’s army and civilian centres. As such, we must stand ready to deploy our own air force to defend such sites from bombing."
 STW_bomb_it_to_shit_focus:0 "Attack Griffenheim"
 STW_bomb_it_to_shit_focus_desc:0 "In the event of war, our army will likely find itself on the defensive against the vast land forces of the imperial army. However, the development of long-range bombing aircraft could provide a lucrative means of assaulting Griffenheim and other imperial centres."
 STW_plane_developement:0 "Death from Above"
 STW_plane_developement_desc:0 "The concept of terror bombing still gives many within our high command cold talons. Yet, as the reality of modern war becomes ever more apparent, the civilian populace of hostile nations has been proven to be an effective asset for the production of war materials.  We must deny the enemy such an asset."
 STW_anti_planes_bullets:0 "The Air Force Volunteer Corp"
 STW_anti_planes_bullets_desc:0 "Across the nation, our government is installing hundreds of anti-air guns which will protect our cities and industrial parks from the threat of aerial bombardment. However, it is up to our civilian populace to heed the call and join in the Air Force Volunteer Corp, manning these guns when the alarm bells chime."
 STW_close_air_support:0 "Aerial Assault"
 STW_close_air_support_desc:0 "The development of a new class of aircraft which are small, nimble, and equipped with cannons and light bombs would be highly beneficial. These would be able to disrupt enemy combat formations and provide a reliable means of assaulting strongpoints and armour. "
 STW_more_fields:0 "Upgrade Air Fields"
 STW_more_fields_desc:0 "While the airfield grants were effective in producing rudimentary facilities, there is still much work to be done into modernizing these sites. Runways need to be paved, control towers manned and staffed, and modern maintenance and repair facilities put in place. With these upgrades, we can expect these sites to handle a far larger amount of aircraft."
 STW_more_planes:0 "Dominate the Skies"
 STW_more_planes_desc:0 "If our recent experiences have proven anything, it is that dominance in the skies is a must if we wish to wage a successful war against the empire. As such, we must mobilize our industrial base into building more fighters, bombers, and other aircraft to accomplish this ambitious task."
 STW_valschermtroepen:0 "Valschermptroepen"
 STW_valschermtroepen_desc:0 "Griffons have been gifted with a natural ability to fly, allowing us the means to paradrop forces safely behind enemy lines. If these units were given ample training, they could be a useful weapon in causing chaos behind enemy lines, tying up hostile forces, and capturing strategic sites as a prelude to an operation."
 STW_rakettekes:0 "Liquid Propellant Rockets"
 STW_rakettekes_desc:0 "Theorists in Feathesia have begun to develop a new generation of rockets which can travel considerable distances and hold payloads that might prove useful in war. By building upon this research we can hope to achieve even more outstanding results, providing our armed forces with another means of striking at our foes."

Due to this she is often absent, more than rulers normally are.\nShe wants to be involved in many parts of the court life which means that she makes many of her advisors wait for her input.\nIt regularly grinds down the court to a halt when she leaves again to visit her family in the capital of the empire."
STW_modernisation_restistance:0 "Resistance to Progress"
STW_modernisation_restistance_desc:0 "Many of the petty lords within the realm can feel the winds of change under their feathers, but they are not sitting by idly.\nWhile Eagleclaw commands the respect of many of her lords, she can notice their resistance to change more and more.
