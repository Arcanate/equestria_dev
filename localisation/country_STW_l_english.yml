STW_absent_ruler:0 "An Absent Ruler"
STW_absent_ruler_desc:0 "While Eagleclaw has the best in mind for her subjects, she is also part of the larger court life in the Griffonian Empire. Due to this she is often absent, more than rulers normally are.\nShe wants to be involved in many parts of the court life which means that she makes many of her advisors wait for her input.\nIt regularly grinds down the court to a halt when she leaves again to visit her family in the capital of the empire."
STW_modernisation_restistance:0 "Resistance to Progress"
STW_modernisation_restistance_desc:0 "Many of the petty lords within the realm can feel the winds of change under their feathers, but they are not sitting by idly.\nWhile Eagleclaw commands the respect of many of her lords, she can notice their resistance to change more and more. Rooting out this resistance to change might take many years, or a few less with a more heavy clawed approach."
