 ### Industry
 STW_industry_start:0 "The Second Industrial Revolution"
 STW_industry_start_desc:0 "Industrialization has been slow to reach Griffonia, with our own nation only experiencing the first vestiges. However, our lands are rich in coal, iron, and oil, and to properly exploit this we must invest in a new era of heavy manufacturing that will make us the pride of the Empire."
 # Loyalist/Eagleclaw
 STW_move_to_the_city:0 "Develop Readewetter"
 STW_move_to_the_city_desc:0 "Our capital is the thriving heart of the Strawberry Duchy, housing the majority of our industrial development. However, there is room to expand and turn the city into a crowning industrial jewel for the Empire. However, such a dream will not come cheap and will require much investment on our behalf."
 STW_support_big_business:0 "Subsidize Domestic Industries"
 STW_support_big_business_desc:0 "We offer land and a skilled workforce, however industrial investment has been slow to trickle in, making our dreamed industrialization a slow crawl. However, our administration has begun a bold plan of tax reform and subsidies, helping to prop up domestic firms, which might just need a little extra help to compete on the world stage."
 STW_money_for_the_nobles:0 "Sell Duchy Lands"
 STW_money_for_the_nobles_desc:0 "Large swathes of rural land remain under the Duchy’s jurisdiction, generating a meagre profit in terms of rent and agricultural surplus. By selling these lands to interested nobles, we can generate significant revenues which can then be invested into Readewetter, offering a far more lucrative business opportunity for our administration."
 STW_privatisation_railway:0 "All Roads Lead to Readewetter"
 STW_privatisation_railway_desc:0 "The vast resources of the countryside struggle to reach Readewetter, denying our mills, factories, and enterprises the wealth of our nation. By working in tandem with private firms, we can ensure that the infrastructure needed to tap into these vast resources is developed, allowing for the cheaper flow of goods into our capital and heart of the economy."
 STW_start_resource_projects:0 "Eastern Investment"
 STW_start_resource_projects_desc:0 "Our three eastern provinces are rich in natural resources. However, our infrastructure and investment in this region is rather lackluster, meaning that the mines and oilfields of the east are running at only a fraction of their potential capacity. By investing in this region, we can ensure a greater quantity of industrial resources to fuel the rapidly growing demand within Readewetter."
 STW_military_industrial_complex:0 "The Military-Industrial Complex"
 STW_military_industrial_complex_desc:0 "In modern war we can not rely upon a few government firms to provide the equipment of our military in prolonged engagements. Instead, we must call upon our civilian sector to come to our aid, providing their industrial assets to the nation, allowing us to produce guns, bullets, tanks, and planes at a rate that would’ve been unimaginable even a decade earlier."
 STW_electronics:0 "The Era of Electronics"
 STW_electronics_desc:0 "The radio has revolutionized mass communication, allowing for a message to be carried to thousands of griffons simultaneously. For years, we have imported foreign radios into our nation, creating a reliance upon manufacturers in Griffenheim. To break this dependency, our firms must adopt the mission of developing, designing, and producing our own domestic variant."
 STW_create_new_industrial_parks:0 "A New Readewetter"
 STW_create_new_industrial_parks_desc:0 "Readewetter has become the crowning jewel of industrialization that our nation needed. However, the city is taped with further development becoming an increasingly costly endeavour. However, the other cities of the Duchy are chomping at the bit to witness a similar change in their fortune. What city will become the next Readewetter?"
 STW_invite_magical_one_horns:0 "Import Equestrian Expertise"
 STW_invite_magical_one_horns_desc:0 "Equestria has thrived through its industrial revolution, offering a shining example of the wonders to come to our great nation. Along with this example, they have also trained and given experience to a wide range of economists, engineers, technicians, and managers. By importing this talent into our nation, we can ensure that we don’t have to 'reinvent the wheel' with our industrialization."
 STW_encourage_construction:0 "Construction Boom"
 STW_encourage_construction_desc:0 "The growth of Readewetter, in recent years, has sponsored a wave of construction, which has employed and trained thousands of griffons in the field. Their expertise has proven vital in aiding the rapid development of our capital and outlying regions."
 #Commie/Fash
 STW_support_the_farms:0 "Modernize Agriculture"
 STW_support_the_farms_desc:0 "The countryside of the Duchy has long been neglected, left in the hands of a semi-feudal system of large-scale noble estate exploiting unlanded poor. Not only is this system inefficient at producing food but it also locks a large pool of potential labour within the fields of the Duchy. By investing in modern agricultural techniques, we can begin to do away with this system and modernize."
 STW_workers_rights:0 "The Ministry of Labour"
 STW_workers_rights_desc:0 "Industrialized economies have a delicate balancing act to follow, where the interests of craftgriffs must be weighed against the profits of investors. By creating a dedicated Ministry of Labour, we can appoint a minister to oversee labour relations and ensure that labour disruptions and worker abuses are kept to an absolute minimum."
 STW_7_hour_workday:0 "The 8 Hour Workday"
 STW_7_hour_workday_desc:0 "‘8 hours of work, 8 hours of rest, and 8 hours of leisure' has been a rallying call amongst our urban workforce for awhile now, fostering a rather vocal interest in the subject. By passing a law, mandating this practice, we will assuredly win favour from the working populace within our cities."
 STW_seize_noble_lands:0 "Breakup Noble Estates"
 STW_seize_noble_lands_desc:0 "While investments in modernizing agriculture have made some inroads in addressing the social issues of the countryside, the lingering structures left by the previous semi-feudal system still linger. As such, we must begin to acquire noble estates and begin the process of breaking them apart and dolling them out to the populace, ensuring that they are managed far more effectively."
 STW_expand_mines:0 "Exploit our Mineral Wealth"
 STW_expand_mines_desc:0 "The great mines of Drawftail and Starclaw are prosperous to our populace. However, they are operated at only a fraction of their potential capacity. By expanding our operations, we can drastically increase our supply of iron, coal, and other strategically vital assets."
 STW_drill_for_oil:0 "Exploit Osnabeak"
 STW_drill_for_oil_desc:0 "The great plains of Osnabeak are marked by rows of oil derricks, pumping crude and natural gas out of the ground. However, the region still has a vast reserve of resources just waiting to be exploited. By investing in additional infrastructure and equipment, we can vastly increase our supply and help meet Imperial demands for generations."
 STW_nationalize_rail:0 "Connect the Countryside"
 STW_nationalize_rail_desc:0 "Outside of Readewetter, our nation is connected by a series of fragile rail lines, poorly paved roads, and dirt paths. This severely limits our economy, making the transportation of goods a dangerous, difficult, and costly endeavour. By investing in upgrades to our infrastructure network, we can increase the connectivity of the countryside to Readewetter, greatly benefiting our economy."
 STW_more_guns:0 "Decentralize the Arms Industry"
 STW_more_guns_desc:0 "Growing connectivity to the countryside has allowed us to move industry outside of the city of Readewetter. By doing this, we can decentralize our arms industry, ensuring that our war effort would be allowed to endure even if our capital was to be bombed or captured by hostile factions. While less efficient, it’s a safety net we’ll greatly benefit from in the event of war."
 STW_investagation_electronics:0 "Readewetter I"
 STW_investagation_electronics_desc:0 "Electrical Engineers at the University of Readewetter have designed a machine which can complete basic arithmetic. Dubbed Readewetter, this initial machine might seem rather simplistic, but the designers promise, that with proper funding, such a device could prove to be the future of mathematics, performing calculations beyond what mere griffons could ever hope to achieve."
 STW_large_scale_construction:0 "Taming Nature"
 STW_large_scale_construction_desc:0 "Raging rivers and rugged mountains, these issues plague development within our Duchy. However, with our pool of labour growing, we can begin an extensive public works project to bring nature to heel, controlling our vast rivers and harsh landscape so that it may benefit our griffons in the future."

######### Ideas:
STW_absent_ruler:0 "An Absent Ruler"
STW_absent_ruler_desc:0 "While Eagleclaw has the best in mind for her subjects, she is also part of the larger court life in the Griffonian Empire. Due to this she is often absent, more than rulers normally are.\nShe wants to be involved in many parts of the court life which means that she makes many of her advisors wait for her input.\nIt regularly grinds down the court to a halt when she leaves again to visit her family in the capital of the empire."
STW_modernisation_restistance:0 "Resistance to Progress"
STW_modernisation_restistance_desc:0 "Many of the petty lords within the realm can feel the winds of change under their feathers, but they are not sitting by idly.\nWhile Eagleclaw commands the respect of many of her lords, she can notice their resistance to change more and more. Rooting out this resistance to change might take many years, or a few less with a more heavy clawed approach."
