operationariettesphasefour:0 "Operation Ariettes Phase Four"
operationariettesphasefour_desc:0 "Both the partitioning of Olenia and the settlement of changelings within the new partitions show that we can openly lead other people under the right circumstances. Both Olenians and Changelings prove that a greater syndicalist state is possible, but it will never exist if our old nemesis, Equestria, still stands."
chncolonization:0 "Establish The Commissariats"
chncolonization_desc:0 "As legal as the new Olenian government is, the war has left the country in a state of disarray.

Perhaps this is the start of something greater..."
chncomshowtrials:0 "The Vaverfront Trials"

CHN_olenian_factories:0 "Relocate Olenian Industry"
CHN_olenian_factories_desc:0 "The Olenian coastline houses some of the Deer's most advanced factories, unfortunately for us utilising said complexes for our own benefit has proven rather difficult with the numerous partisans and ruffians harrasing our supply lines in the country's interior. Until a more permenant solution to our logistical issues inside of Olenia is found these factories shall be relocated to the Changeling heartland."
CHN_olenian_volunteers:0 "Olenian Collaborators"
CHN_olenian_volunteers_desc:0 "Propaganda can do wonders. Brainwashed Olenian youth will join our ranks to fight in the name of Changeling Lands and the Queen, for she is their saviour and protector.

CHN_study_olenian_magic:0 "Olenian Application of Magic"
CHN_study_olenian_magic_desc:0 "An Olenian seer once said: "Magic makes a warrior into a berserker".

CHN_modern_cities:0 "Modern Changeling Hives"
CHN_modern_cities_desc:0 "Most of the changeling hives will finally have modern architecture with concrete spires, highrises, metro and automobile roads.

CHN_vesalipolis_protection:0 "Protection of the Capital"
CHN_vesalipolis_protection_desc:0 "It seems very unlikely, but our enemies may be able to reach our capital with modern planes. We must take precautions to ensure safety of the heart of our nation, our glorious Queen and the government. Anti-air defences will be constructed on the way to Vesalipolis and in Vesalipolis itself. A bunker for emergency situations will also be built under Vesalipolis."
CHN_queens_island_facility:0 "Queen's Island Secret Facility"
CHN_queens_island_facility_desc:0 "The isolated Queen's Island in the Gorak Gulf would be a great place for secret science facility.

CHN_great_war_beginning:0 "Plan "Alicorn Sunset""
CHN_great_war_beginning_desc:0 "The time to regain our lost honour is finally coming. The changelings will take their rightful place as the lords of Equus.

The twilight of the gods is about to begin."
CHN_high_command_cabinet_1:0 "Restructure the Command System"
CHN_high_command_cabinet_1_desc:0 "To establish a clear and orderly hierarchy, changes have to be made. Needless positions will be abolished and we will ensure every officer has a single superior, to prevent conflicting orders. The new chain of command must be clear to all; they must also remember that at the very top is the Queen herself, and that disobeying her commands is unwise."
CHN_high_command_cabinet_2:0 "Officers and Communications"
CHN_high_command_cabinet_2_desc:0 "To fill in gaps created by the recent reorganization of the ranks, promising officers will be promoted to higher positions. Not only that, but the importance of rapid and clear communication has been realized. Commands cannot be interpreted in more than one way, and they cannot get lost on the way. Dedicated signallers will be added to all units."
CHN_high_command_cabinet_3:0 "Order and Discipline"
CHN_high_command_cabinet_3_desc:0 "Dissent among the ranks will not be tolerated. We must fight as one, and deviancy from rules and commands must be punished severely. Cowardice and desertion shall become punishable by death. It will be the iron discipline of the Changeling Army that will bring us victory, not shiny tanks or big guns alone."
CHN_changeling_school_of_war:0 "Changeling School of War"
CHN_changeling_school_of_war_desc:0 "Our race has waged war with itself for countless centuries before Queen Chrysalis united us. Rapid decisive attacks by mobile swarms led by competent commanders were always the key to victory. If it is not broken, why fix it? All we have to do is update our doctrine to modern times."
CHN_griffon_school_of_war:0 "Griffon School of War"
CHN_griffon_school_of_war_desc:0 "Before its collapse from within, the Griffonian Empire had the largest army in the world. Its units were drilled with defence in mind, to hold on to vast swathes of land and to repel aggressive uprisings and raids. Perhaps defence is best offence, as with bite-and-hold tactics we will slowly but surely advance. We have much to learn from our feathered friends."
CHN_modern_cities2:0 "Marsh Railroad"
CHN_modern_cities2_desc:0 "The Great Marsh is a giant obstacle for the changelings to travel across the country to such cities as Volistad and Equestrian border. Construction of modern railroads will allow for international and domestic tourism and will aid southern businesses to reach the central region easily."
CHN_demand_yak:0 "Invade the Yaks"
CHN_demand_yak_desc:0 "The yaks are a proud warrior race, and they will not be subdued easily. They only respect strength, so if we wish them to recognize Chrysalis as the overlord of Equus, we must prove our strength to them. Their tall mountains and frozen forests won't be an obstacle for our mighty army!"
CHN_demand_png:0 "Secure the North"
CHN_demand_png_desc:0 "The penguins control the strategically vital northern sea passage and have so far refused to recognize Chrysalis as their master. Clearly, they must be taught a violent lesson in humility. The pathetic flightless birds will be easy prey."

CHN_Bomber_2_desc:0 "Dive bombers and other ground attack planes will bring an important advantage to the forces on the ground, keeping the enemy suppressed at longer ranges than conventional fire, and taking out strategic targets."
CHN_Bomber_3:0 "Strategic Bombers"
CHN_Bomber_3_desc:0 "Long range, high altitude strategic bombers can deliver a crippling strike to the industry of a hypothetical enemy. It may be that one factory that builds that one rifle that wins the war."
CHN_Paratroopers:0 "Paratroopers"
CHN_Paratroopers_desc:0 "Using the wings of changeling soldiers allows us to drop more elite units behind enemy lines and take keypoints to, say, encircle them, or to secure ports for a larger invasion."
CHN_Fighter_1:0 "Fighters"
CHN_Fighter_1_desc:0 "Development of fighter aircraft in general is something that would help not only the air force, but also the civilian recreational sector too."
CHN_Fighter_2:0 "Advanced Fighters"
CHN_Fighter_2_desc:0 "More advanced fighters are the stuff of dreams, but what if we decide to turn them from dreams, to reality?"
CHN_Fighter_3:0 "Long Ranged Fighters"
CHN_Fighter_3_desc:0 "Heavy fighters which escort strategic bombers are not only beneficial for the bombers, but they can also be stationed at airfields further from the front line and still be effective."
CHN_Rocketry:0 "Rocket Tests"
CHN_Rocketry_desc:0 "An engine powered by a fuel and oxidiser is not only something out of legend, but it's right around the corner in reality, too."
CHN_Wunderwaffe:0 "Wunderwaffe"
CHN_Wunderwaffe_desc:0 "The nuclear theory, codenamed 'wunderwaffe', is our greatest secret as a changeling nation. To let any other nation know about our experiments into splitting the atom would be to risk war."
CHN_Rocketry_Phase_Two:0 "Continued Rocket Tests"
CHN_Rocketry_Phase_Two_desc:0 "The initial tests of solid fuel rockets and pulse jets were successful, but if we move to liquid fuel, not only do we get a better range out of our rockets, but we can lower the throttle when required."
CHN_Jets:0 "Jet Engines"
CHN_Jets_desc:0 "The jet engine is not only a very complex piece of machine, but it can utterly revolutionise civilian aerospace, and the military air space. Higher speeds, longer ranges. But first, we need an engine."
CHN_Jet_Fighter:0 "Jet Fighters"
CHN_Jet_Fighter_desc:0 "With our engine ready for production, we need to develop a plane purpose built for the purpose of flying at high speeds, while under high thrust numbers."
CHN_Jet_Tactical_Bomber:0 "Jet Tactical Bombers"
CHN_Jet_Tactical_Bomber_desc:0 "A mid range tactical bomber has no need to have defensive armament like its conventionally propelled predecessors, as they can theoretically outrun their enemies. In addition, it might make a good passenger plane."
CHN_Jet_Strategic_Bomber:0 "Jet Strategic Bombers"
CHN_Jet_Strategic_Bomber_desc:0 "Not only could cargo and freight make use of a large aircraft that can carry heavier loads, but the power of the jet engine would allow us to carry heavier bomb loads."
CHN_defend_the_north:0 "Northern Defences"
CHN_defend_the_north_desc:0 "Despite our desires to be peaceful and share friendship, other nations are unpredictable. If the North were to fall, our enemy would not only control our coast, but be one step closer to Vesalipolis."
CHN_central_hives:0 "Central Defences"
CHN_central_hives_desc:0 "Ensuring that our capital is a suitable area to fall back to and hold will give us an edge against any hypothetical foe."
CHN_defend_the_south:0 "Southern Defences"
CHN_defend_the_south_desc:0 "While the ponies of Equestria helped King Thorax learn the magic of friendship, as of late the situation in Equestria has become uncertain. A backup plan may be required."
CHN_fortress:0 "Fortress Vesalipolis"
CHN_fortress_desc:0 "While Vesalipolis is already heavily defended, the loss of the heart of our hives would result in our downfall, and we might not bounce back this time."
CHN_Changeling_Naval_Supremacy:0 "Naval Purchase"
CHN_Changeling_Naval_Supremacy_desc:0 "If there was a navy before the civil war, Chrysalis and those still loyal to her scuttled it before we could take it. As a result, we'll have to purchase spare ships from our neighbours."
CHN_carrier_navy:0 "Carrier Dominance"
CHN_carrier_navy_desc:0 "A focus on carriers, and naval air warfare, will ensure that even the heaviest armoured ship will no longer be a threat."
CHN_battleship_navy:0 "Battleship Dominance"
CHN_battleship_navy_desc:0 "Battleships embody the same things a changeling does. A heavily armoured fighting force that's not to be reckoned with."
CHN_submarine_effort:0 "Submarine Designs"
CHN_submarine_effort_desc:0 "All forms of navy benefit from submarines. Not only can they strike slow, lumbering ships, but they can be used to raid enemy convoys and keep their troops from being supplied."
CHN_Naval_Bomber:0 "Torpedo Bombers"
CHN_Naval_Bomber_desc:0 "Naval Torpedo Bombers, when used properly, have the potential to not only sink a ship, but sink an entire hostile fleet. Ensuring we've got the best naval fighters will give us a great advantage."
CHN_Navy_Doctrine:0 "Doctrinal Effort"
CHN_Navy_Doctrine_desc:0 "Without the proper doctrine to support them, no ship is capable of doing its job correctly. Developing better naval theory is paramount."
CHN_Destroyers:0 "Improved Destroyers"
CHN_Destroyers_desc:0 "Destroyers are part of the backbone of every navy, without them, the larger ships are vulnerable to submarines and other destroyers."
CHN_Light_Cruisers:0 "Modernised Cruisers"
CHN_Light_Cruisers_desc:0 "Cruisers serve as the other part of the backbone. Without them, those same ships are easy prey for air forces."
CHN_Escort_Carriers:0 "Escort Carrier Designs"
CHN_Escort_Carriers_desc:0 "While not as large as fleet carriers, escort carriers are useful for ensuring that our smaller fleets have naval air power to back them up, no matter the situation."
CHN_Carriers:0 "Modern Carrier Designs"
CHN_Carriers_desc:0 "Bigger carriers with more deck space is the omega, the end, of the carrier development. Such a ship would be the epitome of naval warfare."
CHN_Heavy_Cruisers:0 "Heavy Cruiser Designs"
CHN_Heavy_Cruisers_desc:0 "Battleships, while no doubt impressive, still need support from their smaller sisters. Heavy cruisers not only provide anti-air support, but also bring main armament to match the might of the battleship."
CHN_Battlecruisers:0 "Battlecruisers Designs"
CHN_Battlecruisers_desc:0 "Even with the impressive combination of firepower from both heavy cruisers and battleships, there still needs to be something in the middle to fill the place of either of the other two if they are otherwise unavailable. A Battlecruiser."
CHN_Battleships:0 "Battleship Designs"
CHN_Battleships_desc:0 "The final form of the battleship is the image most imagine. Heavy armour, huge guns, and with enough size to send any lesser enemy retreating back to their home port."
CHN_Marine_Operations:0 "Marine Tactics"
CHN_Marine_Operations_desc:0 "The development of amphibious troops designed to attack enemies where no land path is possible is something that should be focused on, as the advantage it would deliver is beyond immeasurable."
CHN_Swarms_In_The_Sky:0 "Swarms In The Sky"
CHN_Swarms_In_The_Sky_desc:0 "Filling the skies fighters from both the Air Force and the Naval Air Force will guarantee our victory, as no hostiles planes will remain up to strike us."
CHN_Bomber_Command:0 "Bomber Command"
CHN_Bomber_Command_desc:0 "Creating a unit solely for the purpose of directing our bombers will not only increase effectiveness of communications, but guarantee the right targets are struck."
CHN_Hive_Factories:0 "Lyctida Wood Industry"
CHN_Hive_Factories_desc:0 "Lyctida is one of the five biggest hives of the Changeling Lands. Historically it is known for massive lumber production. Wood is strategically important resource for the nation. Creation of new lumber factories will open us an opportunity to increase our furtniture and paper industry."
CHN_polar_bear_envoy:0 "Envoy to Polar Bears"
CHN_polar_bear_envoy_desc:0 "To the east, the Polar Bears hold dominion. While they are, as a species, definitely dangerous, that does not apply to their nation as a whole; their military is far behind ours. It should be an easy matter to extort gold from them"
CHN_threaten_PLB:0 "Threaten the Bear"
CHN_threaten_PLB_desc:0 "It seems words alone will not get us what we want. We will have to show them that we are serious and fully capable of following up on our threats."
CHN_attack_PLB:0 "Strike the Bear"
CHN_attack_PLB_desc:0 "Even after our threats, the bears continue to defy us. It is time to teach them a lesson! We are changelings and we do not back down!."
CHN_resources_of_PLB:0 "Polar Resources"
CHN_resources_of_PLB_desc:0 "With the additition of the Polar Bear territories we have conquered, even more potential resources has fallen into our grasp. None of them will go to waste."
CHN_modern_infrastructure_PLB:0 "Infrastructure Improvements for Bears"
CHN_modern_infrastructure_PLB_desc:0 "The Polar territories are in a pitiful state. There are few roads, and even fewer of those are suitable for our heavy industry and military manuevers. We must put effort in where they have not."
CHN_thermonuclear_research_in_PLB:0 "Key Lake Thermonuclear Research"
CHN_thermonuclear_research_in_PLB_desc:0 "Key Lake is an ideal test site, or at least, the eastern side of it is. Sparsely populated and in an isolated area, it would make a perfect site for testing our more...dangerous weapons."

CHN_force_ponies_to_work:0 "Pony-Workers Resettlement"
CHN_force_ponies_to_work_desc:0 "Our conquest only began, but we can already reap the benefits of it. The new resettlement program "Plan West" will help us develop the lands of our nation with hooves of the ponies. 300 thousand ponies will be moved from their homes to Changeling Lands to work for the benefit of the Queen and her nation."
CHN_force_ponies_to_repair:0 "Form Pony Work Battallions"
CHN_force_ponies_to_repair_desc:0 "As the invasion progresses, it desolates the rich lands of Equestria. Creating work groups from the locals will help us keep the infrastructure and industry intact on the newly taken territories."

chn_queen_helvia_desc:0 "The young queen of the thriving port hive of Ditrysium is interested in commercial expansion and increase of naval production. While Ditrysium was the first major hive to ally Vesalipolis, Helvia is not as fond of Chrysalis as her predecessor. The debacle of 1002 eventually led to communist sailors rioting in Ditrysium and Chrysalis crushed the resistance personally without asking Helvia. However, she is pragmatic and knows maintaining good relations with Vesalipolis is ultimately a positive thing."
chn_queen_aurantia:0 "Queen Aurantia"
chn_queen_aurantia_desc:0 "The aging queen of the industrial hive-city of Lyctida is able to provide resources and lumber for our railroads and military equipment. Ever since Chrysalis lead her alliance to save Lyctida from marauding deer zealots, she has been her most loyal supporter. She always strives to earn Chrysalis' favour, but she in turn sees Aurantia as a useful and reliable pawn until she eventually dies from old age."
chn_queen_argynnis:0 "Queen Argynnis"
chn_queen_argynnis_desc:0 "The martial hive of Vraks has always had a tenuous relationship with Vesalipolis, at best. The two had for centuries engaged in skirmishes and raids before Vraks attacked the other hive with full force but was repelled by Chrysalis and her allies from Ditrysium. In 971 Chrysalis struck back with an expanded alliance and crushed Vraks, whose Queen committed suicide rather than face Chrysalis' wrath. Her oldest hatchling, Argynnis, thus became Queen. She holds no grudge against Chrysalis and recognizes her might, but never skips an opportunity to make a mocking, sarcastic comment if she fails."
chn_queen_yaria:0 "Queen Yaria"
chn_queen_yaria_desc:0 "Queen of the largest northern hive of Soryth, which lies on the shore of the Key Lake. The Key Lake is known for its concentration of magical energy. Magic helped changelings of Soryth to survive harsh northern weather for generations. Queen Yaria believes that thorough study of magical abilities of crystals is vital for future success of the changeling nation. She is one of the queens who joined Chrysalis voluntarily and genuinely believes she can lead their race to greatness. In her eyes, changelings have the same potential for magic abilities as unicorns, if they only develop it enough."

Sent to gain a higher education by his family after he showed a quick mind from an early age, Vaspier soon became involved with his nation's political struggles. He was one of the changelings who signed on quickly to Chrysalis' bid to unite the hives, and served as her intel gatherer from that point on. From this position, he built the Changeling intelligence agency, VOPS, into a force to be reckoned with. It was, in fact, his hand that guided the operation of Chrysalis' first attack on Canterlot. That failure damaged his reputation, and since then, he has worked even harder to make himself useful to his Queen. And in this, he has succeeded. The VOPS is the most secretive intelligence agency around, and it is from this that his nickname derives."

changelings.1.t:0 "Olenian Question"
changelings.1.d:0 "Chrysalis is preparing to send a communique to Olenia regarding two of their northern states. Before the modern borders between the Changeling Queendom and the Kingdom of Olenia were formalized, these resource-rich lands had changelings living in them, before they were pushed out by the deer. The border treaty signed with King Aldar II in return for an official recognition of the Changeling Nation has not been renewed since his death, and his successor King Johan is considered by many to be illegitimate. Clearly, it is time to revise the treaty, and regain rightful changeling land.\n\nThis is exactly what the Queen needs. She will send an ultimatum to [OLE.GetLeader], demanding they cede these states immediately. If they agree, she will gain deposits of valuable strategic resources. If they refuse, she has an excuse to invade and force the deer into submission. She chuckles to herself, satisfied with her own cunning."
changelings.1.a:0 "Send it."
changelings.2.t:0 "Protectorate over Olenia"
changelings.2.d:0 "We're bound to offer Olenia to become our protectorate. Harmonic influence from Equestria and communist influence from Stalliongrad have destabilized the country and continue to threaten its sovereignty. Clearly, if we do not intervene, our rivals will expand their spheres of influence at our expense. Queen Chrysalis is generous and voluntarily proposes to save Olenia by making it a protectorate of the Changeling Queendom. They would be foolish to not accept the offer."
changelings.2.a:0 "Send it."
changelings.3.t:0 "Conquest"
changelings.4.t:0 "States Ceded"
changelings.4.d:0 "[OLE.GetLeader] has given in to Chrysalis' ultimatum and ceded the demanded lands over to our control. They were clearly intimidated by our might, which proves what easy prey they are. While Chrysalis hoped they would've rejected her demand, she is satisfied with the outcome nonetheless."

changelings.5.t:0 "[From.GetName] Rejects our Demands!"
changelings.5.d:0 "Our demand of ceding Solgud Bergskedja and Feer Dalar has been rejected by the Olenian government. It is clear they have deluded themselves and think their military might is somehow comparable to ours. Chrysalis is pleased with this news however, as she now has an excuse to invade Olenia in the future to safeguard the interests of the changeling hives."

In the letter he claims that the Changelings and all other creatures living in the northern land could be a great asset to Equestria in their war if they were finally given an independent military organization again. The letter was met by mixed feelings by the general staff. Some claim that giving the Changelings their own command is just asking for the horrors of the Great War to repeat themselves, but this time on a second front. Others say that the general staff is already overworked managing all of Equestria's divisions, armies, army groups, and theaters, and that [From.GetNameDef] taking over some of the load would be a good help."

changelingattache.1.d:0 "'Because of internal matters within the Changeling Lands the scientists, soldiers, advisors, and all related personnel of the Changeling-Griffonian Expeditionary Mission are hereby ordered to return home at once by the decree of Queen Chrysalis.'\nThe message is simple, written in a taciturn dialect of the language the two distant nations share, yet profound in its meaning. For years the changelings assisting the Imperial Army and attached research divisions have become a staple of life for those in the upper echelons of the command hierarchy, and now it is time for them to leave. The mood is unsurprisingly somber when the message is read aloud, both for what leaving means and for what awaits the changelings in their homeland.\nSynovial, senior military commander of the mission, seems relieved at the news, as if a great weight had been lifted off his wings. His compatriot, Thranx, seems to have had the opposite reaction, falling into a depressive stupor that in turn lowers the mood of all those near him. The differing reactions have prompted one of the Imperial commanders who worked with the CGEM to voice the idea that they should throw a party for all the members of the mission to wish them fond farewells, for it would seem to be kind to let their last memories of the Griffonian Empire be happy ones."

Luckily for all those involved, when the capital was first moved from Griffonstone to Griffenheim the designers of the new Imperial Palace's grand ballroom had capacity first in mind.\n\nThe party ends up lasting well into the early dawn hours, with many an event to be seen. Scientists exchanged last minute notes while reminiscing about strange discoveries. A noblegriff actually managed to impersonate a changeling colonel, and soldiers of both species broke out into song over large flaggons of beer. Fun was had by all, and somecreature was even able to get Thranx to smile again.\n\nDuring the party though it seems that [GRI.GetLeader] overheard Imperial Army soldiers wishing their Changeling friends that they could help them out or even fight alongside them in whatever struggle awaited them back home. This would lead to a review of supplies and troop strength in the morrow. Theoretically, the proposal could be done, but it also could just be written off as an alcohol-induced hallucination.\n\nIn any case, this night will long be remembered as the rowdiest party in memory, and a true bright spot on the record of Imperial affairs."

At the end, however, the choice was entirely up to the ruling griffon themselves.\n\nAs Thranx broke down in tears before them, a choice had to be made."

She now calls for us to return him home at once, so that she, as his rightful Queen, can deal with him and his treacherous dealings, accordingly.\n\nThranx has proven to be a good, valuable friend to us, and he appreciates our help and support.

When he was brought to the Queen, the disgust on her face sealed the fate of the young General. No less than 20 minutes after his arrival at Vesalipolis, he was blindfolded, and Field Marshal Trimmel himself commanded the firing squad. A loud bang echoed throughout the hive, and Thranx was no more."

changelingattache.8.a:0 "The queen will be most displeased..."

changelingattache.9.t:0 "Chrysalis Swears Revenge"
changelingattache.9.d:0 "The Queen gnarled aloud as she listened to the changeling in front of her who relayed the Griffonian response to her. With a swift stroke and blast from her crooked horn, the small and unimportant minion was obliterated, and only a black, dusty crater remained where he had stood.\n\n"Listen to me when I say this: the wicked and disgusting griffons within the Empire have today made the biggest mistake in their sorry, petty lives! Their 'empire' had already been torn apart by their own minions, and their decadence and incompetence even today does not cease to amaze me. If they so valiantly refuse my orders and demands, then they must be entirely unaware of who they've just made an enemy with. Their sorry little Empire will collapse like a house of cards, and I will tear it apart and burn it and its citizens to ashes myself if I have to! None shall stand in my way!"\n\nThe other changelings present applauded and cheered for their Queen."
changelingattache.9.a:0 "We will strike them soon enough."

changelingattache.10.t:0 "Revenge of the Queen"
changelingattache.10.d:0 "It all appeared to be a perfectly normal day, today. For the most part.\n\nGeneral Thranx had used the time in Griffonia and away from other changelings to better incorporate himself into the life of a griffon. Often times he had used his shapeshifting abilities to 'fit in', but many griffons, especially those who had previously worked with him, respected and liked him either way, no matter the appearance.\nThranx has even gone so far as finding a lover that lived just outside of the capital. It was all too perfect, it seemed, and the lone Changeling appeared to be in good claws.\n\nThat was nothing but a ruse though, it seems. Earlier today, during a visit at a restaurant, Thranx began to cough heavily, and shortly after collapsed to the ground. Griffons nearby immediately rushed to his rescue, seeing him cough up blood, but it was no use. General Thranx... died.\n\nA funeral has already been organised for this brave changeling, and he has been issued  griffonian citizenship post-mortem to thank him for the appreciation he shared for our nation and culture.\n\nShockingly though, police has found out that the cause of Thranx death was a deadly poison, one that has never been seen or used in all of Griffonia before. In addition, his fiancée is nowhere to be found following his death. Could this be the work of a fellow changeling, sent by Chrysalis? For now, we are unsure."
changelingattache.10.a:0 "Rest in peace, friend."

changelingattache.11.t:0 "Best Served With Wine"
changelingattache.11.d:0 "Fantastic news reached us from Griffonia today, my Queen! The devilish traitor, General Thranx, has been killed by one of our infiltrators today!\n\nIt appears that Thranx had tried to fit into the Griffonian society. So much, in fact, that he tried to seek out a lover. Our infiltrator used this opportunity to charm and get near him, and later poisoned his drink while they were eating at a restaurant. The infiltrator managed to flee the scene before anyone could catch onto him."
changelingattache.11.a:0 "The Traitor is dead, at last."

changelingattache.12.t:0 "The Griffonian Empire Sends Volunteers"
changelingattache.12.d:0 "In a surprising turn of events, our contribution to the CGEM returned home with thousands of griffon soldiers in tow. Their commander says that they are volunteers from the Empire, here to return the favour and foster the bonds of friendship that bind our two nations.\n\nQueen Chrysalis seemed visibly disgusted at the news, all but gagging at the mere mention of the word friendship. Before she could reply though, Trimmel publicly thanked the volunteers and assigned them positions in the Army. Chrysalis is furious at this, and said that if harmony grows it will be Trimmel's fault, but otherwise made no moves against it."

changelingattache.14.t_annex:0 "Soldiers Without Home"
changelingattache.14.d:0 "Evening had fallen over Griffenheim, the gas lamps of the city lightning up the streets as the last few shops closed up for the day. Two changelings in full military uniform sat at a café, slowly sipped a cup of coffee each, taking in the majesty of the city, looking out on the plaza besides them. It had been a long time since they had arrived in the city, but nonetheless, their usual place, the Café Central always provided the best coffee and view. At least one a lot better than anything you could get in Vesalipolis. \n\nOne of the changelings, eyes a bright blue began talking as he lit up a cigarette "Been a long time since we heard from Her Majesty. From what Der Bürger says, the war must be going badly, Synoval"\n\n"Thranx, I trust that these are merely some kind of propaganda from the Ponies. Before long, we will be invited to gala in Canterlot," Synoval answered, pouring a spoonful of sugar into the coffee, before stirring it around.\n\nThranx took another sip of his coffee"I don't know really. The telegraph speaks of the same. Bombardment on Vesalipolis, pushed back from Hjortland. If anything, I would suspect the Palace of keeping us in the dark."\n\n "Think so? You really think they would keep us in the dark?" Synoval deadpanned.\n\n"Yes. We are only here on a voluntary basis because of the war back home," Thranx said as he pulsed on the cigarette, enjoying the goods available in the Empire.\n\n"And yet, if we wanted to go home, we could just grab the first postal plane out of here. It's not like they will take offense," Synoval said, not noticing the waiter coming up behind them.\n\n"Sirs? There's a person on the phone for you. It's from the Changeling Embassy. They say it's urgent," He said, pointing with his left claw towards the bar.\n\nSynoval and Thranx rose from the table. "It seems like our duty calls," Thranx sighed as he put a few coins on the table, walking up to the phone on the bar with Synoval in tow. He picked up the reciever and listened closely.\n\nThe tired and frantic voice in the reciever stammered out a few words before hanging up "Vesalipolis fallen...total collapse...all officers recalled to the homeland to fight against the Equestrian menace."\n\nThranx dropped the reciever, looking towards Synoval, with a blank look.\n\n"Well, what did they say?" Synoval asked, probably somewhat cognizant of the message Thranx had just recieved.\n\nThranx muttered as the words replayed in his head. "The homeland has fallen. We must journey back to do our duty against the Equestrians."\n\nWith that, the Changeling presence in the Empire left, ready to travel home to fight on the fronts once more."
changelingattache.14.d_annex:0 "The front pages of newspapers across Griffonia all bore the same headline today, "Changelings issue unconditional surrender, peace in Equestria".\n\nThe Changeling embassy in Griffenheim confirmed the news, before admitting that their contact with the homeland was now completely cut off. With the Changeling military disintegrating and the future of the entire country up in the air, the question of what to do with the Changeling military mission within the Empire has presented itself. They are now Changelings with no nation, serving under a command that no longer exists.\n\nThe Changelings of the Expedition have adapted well to Griffonia, with many having absorbed Griffonian customs over the many years they have been present in Griffenheim. Granting them Griffonian citizenship and letting them stay would certainly be an option. Their expertise in warfare has been invaluable in modernizing our military. Thranx, in particular, has made it very clear that he would prefer things to continue as they had before.\n\nAlternatively, we could simply send them on their way, leaving them whatever fate has in store for them. Whatever our decision, there is no need to worry about attracting the ire of Chrysalis anymore."

His belief that love can be obtained with friendship and peaceful trading with their neighbours has been slowly catching on among the despondent drones, who feel their lives are being thrown away in pursuit of militaristic expansion. Nonetheless, Thorax's ideas are a minority in the Hives and he is mostly despised by the Hive Queens, who see his vision as detrimental to the changelings as whole. That has changed after the Changelings' defeat in the Great War, and now Thorax leads the reformed nation into a bright future, hoping to show the world that they're not all monsters."

While the Bears have been mostly isolated from the world politics at large, that changed with the arrival of a changeling envoy, who demanded various concessions for their Queen. [PLB.GetLeader] rejected all of these demands as outlandish.\n Naturally, a response from Chrysalis didn't take long, changeling troops crossed the border in a full scale invasion. Bear defences quickly collapsed, and an armistice was signed the following day. With most of the bears retreating to safer lands, a new government was installed under the leadership of a bear known as Björnling, who is, by all accounts, known to be a fascist sympathiser."

While [PLB.GetLeader] has agreed to some of these demands, it was deemed insufficient by the emissary. \nIt seemed as if nothing came out of this, but a week later, a series of raids and skirmishes have begun on the Changeling-Bear border, resulting in devastation of bear villages. The bear leadership, knowing that this could escalate into a full scale invasion, have agreed to the initial changeling demands, wishing to preserve their independence."

They had all gathered to spectate a huge military parade, which had been prepared and advertised for weeks. Changelings had come from all across the nation, and even hive Queens were there.\n\nThe square columns of changeling soldiers dressed in grey soon emerged out of their barracks, marching with synchronized steps and waving their white banners. As they marched, the civilians greeted them with cheers and admired their discipline. Behind them, shiny new Panzers rolled out, with Hivesmarschall Trimmel leading the long column of a hundred tanks. They were followed by motorized divisions in their trucks, artillery battalions with their wheeled guns, marines, sailors, elite jäger squadrons, death squads, and more. It was an endless stream of soldiers armed to the brim with the newest weaponry. The audience was in awe and convinced of the might of their nation.\n\nAt the end of the column came Chrysalis herself, riding in an officer's car and dressed in a snow-white military uniform. She saluted the crowd and the crowd saluted her, chanting "Long live the Queen!" almost fanatically. And as she rode, roaring fighters and bombers appeared in the sky and blotted out the sun."

changelings_paxchrysalia.1000.d:0 "It is finally over.\n\nAfter countless months of bloody struggle, Equestria has finally succumbed to our victorious armies. On every battlefield in every theatre, the pony armies have been routed, crushed, and scattered to the winds. The enemy's organized resistance has been put to an end, and its leaders - those who haven't fled into exile, at least - have formally surrendered in Canterlot. The Great War is over.\n\nBut while the changelings back home pour into the streets in celebration from Vraks to Vesalipolis, those 'lings tasked with garrisoning our new gains are far from jovial. For while Equestria's armed forces lie in ruin, the fighting spirit of the ponies now under changeling rule will be much harder to pacify. As former soldiers melt back into their hometowns with fresh scars and painful memories of the bitter fighting on the front, the civilian population is beginning to mobilize in a way it hadn't during the war. There is much work to be done if we want to guarantee our hold over Equestria will stand the test of time.\n\nQueen Chrysalis has proclaimed this new era the "Pax Chrysalia", but those words are as hollow as the bells that toll our victory.\n\nConquering Equestria was the easy part. Keeping it is the hard part."

Until a new administrative center could be built in the occupied pony capital, Generalmajor Jachs and his staff had set up a temporary headquarters inside of the castle. It might as well have been his new home also; after being installed to oversee the changeling occupation of Canterlot, his life had become nothing but a frantic flurry of paperwork as he tried to build a new governing apparatus from scratch, with little time for sleep, food, or personal hygiene in the meanwhile.\n\nThe doors at the far end of the throne room burst open, and a female 'ling buzzed into the throne room, passing by the half-dozen makeshift desks and tables where other members of Jachs' staff similarly toiled away. She landed in front of Jachs' desk and saluted, her posture picture perfect as ever. "Generalmajor!"\n\nJachs tore his eyes away from the papers on his desk, grateful for the momentary reprieve. "At ease, Oberstleutnant Alcippe. What is it?"\n\n"Missive directly from the Queen, sir," Alcippe said, holding out a piece of paper clutched in a chitinous hoof.\n\nJachs groaned and rubbed his eyes. "Read it for me, would you?

I will be visiting Canterlot in two weeks time, and I expect you to pull out all the stops for my arrival. This parade must be the greatest Equestria, no, the world has ever seen. The procession must last all day, from sunrise to sunset, with flyovers from our proud air force accompanying the rumbling of our victorious tank brigades driving along Mane Street. The survivors of the Royal Guard must be driven before our forces in chains, and the nobility of Canterlot will personally swear their loyalty to me in the Plaza of the Sun. Afterwards, there will be a feast to celebrate Equestria's new Pax Chrysalia that I have brought to them. Make it happen.'"\n\nJachs stared blankly at Alcippe as he began to realize the scope of the Queen's demands. After a moment, Alcippe tucked the note away and cleared her throat, smiling apologetically. "I... suppose this means a lot of work for us, doesn't it?"\n\nJachs pushed his chair away from his desk and stood up. "Come on, Oberstleutnant," he called over his shoulder as he passed Alcippe by. "I need a drink. Badly. Then I'll figure out how the Queen expects us to pull this off.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.2.d:0 "Generalmajor Jachs struggled to stay awake as the parade rolled into its fifth hour. The past two weeks had seen him collect only a few hours of sleep in total, and he'd become increasingly reliant on refined mother's love to keep his energy up to plan this nightmare of a parade. But as the latest changeling fighter planes swooped over Canterlot with a deafening growl from their engines, he allowed himself a little smile. He'd truly delivered everything Chrysalis had wanted, and then some.\n\nThe Queen herself sat only a few seats away, a giddy, almost crazed smile on her muzzle. The display of changeling might and equine humiliation was as satisfying to her as the purest love in all the land. It was practically impossible for the Queen to retain her regal air; instead, she was more like a foal on Hearth's Warming, or whatever the stupid Equestrian expression was. At the very least, a happy Chrysalis was infinitely preferable to a disappointed queen.\n\nWhen it came time for the nobles to swear their fealty to her, however, the cracks in the facade began to show. The ponies assembled below the Queen refused to repeat the oath of loyalty until Oberstleutnant Alcippe prompted them with the first sentence twice more, and even then they only did so begrudgingly. And as Generalmajor Jachs looked out on the faces of the ponies driven out of their homes to provide an audience for the spectacle, the only thing he saw was hatred and anger.\n\nJachs swallowed hard and rubbed his eyes. The Queen was enjoying playing with her toys, yes... but it wouldn't be long before the pieces arrayed themselves against their master. And no matter how hard he tried, the Generalmajor knew that all the tanks and planes in the world couldn't help him hold Equestria if the ponies never accepted the Changeling Hives as their new overlord.\n\nThe parade itself was a masterpiece, sure, but the sleepless nights had hardly ended."

changelings_paxchrysalia.3.d:0 "Generalmajor Jachs shifted uncomfortably in his seat, doing his best to pretend to not notice the side-eyed glare coming from the Queen only a few seats away. Instead of adopting her bombastic (and unrealistic) vision for a victory parade, the Generalmajor and Oberstleutnant Alcippe had sided with caution, cutting the parade down to only a few hours and keeping the citizens of Canterlot inside of their homes for the Queen's safety. While planes roared overhead and tanks rumbled down the streets, Queen Chrysalis' expression remained sour for most of the parade. It was quite obvious this hadn't been what she'd intended.\n\nWhen it came time for the nobles to swear their fealty to the Queen, it was at the end of changeling rifles gathered around the perimeter of the Plaza of the Sun. Though the oath of loyalty went off without a hitch, it was quite obvious to everyling present that there was little honesty carried in the words. It was at that point that the Queen left the parade in disgust and had the feast planned for after the event cancelled. "If these worthless ponies won't feed me their love, then I won't feed them their bread," she proclaimed, right before flitting back to the castle.\n\nJachs and Alcippe shared worried looks from across the aisle. They'd disappointed their queen, and Queen Chrysalis did not tolerate disappointments."

That parade was barely worthy of being called a street fair in Soryth! This was supposed to be my grand moment of triumph, my hour of victory, and it was pathetic!"\n\nGeneralmajor Jachs and Oberstleutnant Alcippe shared nervous looks, the two changelings inching a little further away from their furious queen. "Your majesty, it was for your safety," Jachs began, jumping on the grenade for his inferior. "Canterlot is not yet pacified, and straining our resources like that-!"\n\n"I don't care!" Chrysalis snarled, turning on the two changelings. "These are ponies, Generalmajor. They are weak and pathetic little creatures. And you're telling me that Equestria is a threat to us still?!\n\n"Not to us, of course not," Jachs clarified, attempting to calm the Queen's rage. "Equestria is dead, its army dissolved. It poses no threat to our nation. But the ponies... all it takes is one bullet, your Majesty..."\n\nQueen Chrysalis scowled at him. "Who is in charge of the garrison in this city, Generalmajor? Who kept the ponies trapped in their homes, making it plain to them all that we're so afraid of them we have to keep them locked up?"\n\n"Major Vascen, your Majesty."\n\nChryaslis picked up one of the chairs and crushed it into twigs with her magic before scattering the splinters across the floor. "Tell Major Vascen that his services are no longer required in my army, and put someling that's not afraid of ponies in his place. The ponies must fear us, not the other way around!""

changelings_paxchrysalia.5.d:0 ""Is it everything you need, Generaloberstabsarzt Marsilio?"\n\nMarsilio, recently promoted surgeon-general of the Royal Changeling Heer, looked over his new office in Seaddle. All his papers and books had arrived from Vesalipolis earlier that day, and a few drones had spent the past hour or so putting his office together for him. The room was a little more open than he was used to, given that the building was a repurposed Olenian administrative center, and the deer preferred higher ceilings and deeper walls to accommodate their antlers, but it would do splendidly for his next assignment. Still, it didn't hurt to double check that the mosquito brains that made up the Queen's Guard had actually bothered to read all his instructions for the move. "Have all the reports been collected across Olenia and Equestria?"\n\n"Of course, Generaloberstabsarzt Marsilio," the soldier standing by his side assured him. "The binders are on your desk."\n\n"Good." The surgeon-general waved the soldier away with a hoof. "Then let me get to my work. I shudder to imagine how strained our armies have made our supply lines of love."\n\nThe changeling saluted, and then he was gone, leaving Marsilio on his own. Slowly shaking his head, the surgeon-general walked around his desk and sat down in the high-backed chair, pulling the first of many binders closer. Snatching a pad of paper and a pencil, the changeling began to sift through the pages upon pages of love collections and expenditures all across the Royal Heer, making notes of shortages in the supply lines. Judging by the inefficiencies in the shipments, however, it was becoming all too obvious that the old collection systems were ill-suited for the task at hoof: someway, somehow, supplying all of the Royal Heer, and the citizens of the Changeling Hives themselves, with enough love to sustain continued changeling occupation of its annexed territories. The Royal Heer and the Queen's Guard had so far been unable to figure things out, and that was why Queen Chrysalis herself had promoted Marsilio to be the nation's new surgeon-general. If there was any changeling that could solve the deepening crisis, it was him.\n\n"So long as I don't get tied down with red tape," he muttered to himself."
changelings_paxchrysalia.5.a:0 "By the Queen's command, it will be done."

changelings_paxchrysalia.6.t:0 "A Crisis in the Making"
changelings_paxchrysalia.6.d:0 "Generaloberstabsarzt Marsilio stared at the black letters on the summary in front of him as if they were a death sentence. From the moment he had arrived in Seaddle and gotten his team situated in their new office, he’d had them crunching numbers and revising projections day and night to solve the growing love crisis snaring its tendrils around the Heer and grinding its gears to a halt. While old methods of subsistence love harvesting had worked for the army as it rampaged through Equestria’s lands, now that the war was over and the whole of the pony nation needed to be subdued and administered, it had become clear that this informal collection was unsustainable and completely inefficient for the long-term garrisons needed to keep control of the land. As things stood, the army could not be expected to maintain its love supplies off of harvesting from equine POWs and bleeding entire towns dry. A change was desperately needed.\n\nThankfully, while his team had focused their efforts on understanding the growing love shortage, Marsilio had dedicated his time to developing a new harvesting system. Dense population centers would be prioritized over sparsely populated villages, and love would be collected from the populace on a quarterly basis, with only half the population paying their love tax at a time to leave able bodies still capable of maintaining the necessities of day-to-day living. Importantly, ponies would not be drained to the point of exhaustion and weakness; the less of a hassle it was for them, the less inclined they would be to fight back against the love collectors. All in all, Marsilio’s proposed system would be effective, streamlined, and efficient. But there was only one problem: no matter how hard he crunched the numbers, no matter how much he tweaked a variable here or there, he always came to the same conclusion.\n\nThe Heer could not sustain the army it had conquered Equestria with. It was simply too large and bloated. And if something wasn’t done to trim off the fat, the only way to keep it fueled would be to bleed Equestria dry."

changelings_paxchrysalia.7.d:0 ""...and that leaves us with only one viable option for the long term stability of our nation and our army," Marsilio finished, tapping a baton against the graph projected against the screen in the headquarters of the Royal Changeling Heer. "We must curtail the excesses of the Heer and demilitarize. It is the only way to keep sufficient reserves available for our armies in case we must deal with another threat."\n\nMarsilio watched the generals with hawk-like eyes, quickly gauging to see if he'd gotten through to them in the past hour. Judging by the bored faces and sour frowns, however, he had not. That was made all the more apparent when Generaloberst Dieter Heinrich, Captain of the Queen's Guard, dismissively waved his hoof. "Conjecture and worry," he said, rolling his eyes. "The system as it stands now works just fine. After all, it gave us the supplies we needed to win the war. And now you want to scale back the Heer?" He scoffed, collecting snickering from the other officers in the room. "Such a defeatist attitude is unbecoming of you, Generaloberstabsarzt."\n\nMarsilio forced himself to take a breath before rising to Dieter's challenge. "Taking Equestria was one thing, Generaloberst," Marsilio began. "Holding it is another matter entirely. The war is over; there is no more need for the Heer to remain as engorged and bloated as it is. If we do not scale things back, then our glorious Heer will collapse in on itself from love shortages everywhere." He allowed himself to glare at the vain Queen's Guard captain. "And eventually you will run out of villagers to squeeze for love until they're withered husks."\n\n"The system will gone on as it always has," Heinrich proclaimed, remaining adamant as always. "Besides that, implying that our treatment of these conquered equines is cruel or harsh also implies that they're even worth caring about. They'll fulfill their purpose like any other livestock."\n\n"They aren't livestock, they are people!" Marsilio shouted back. "And if we don't treat them with some respect, then they will fight back!"\n\n"People?" Generaloberst Dieter had a laugh at that. "I think I prefer my opinion to yours, Generaloberstabsarzt. This meeting is over."\n\nAs the Changeling High Command began to rise from their seats and file out of the room, Marsilio looked down at the binder in his hooves, the words 'PROTOCOL FOR THE SAFE AND SUSTAINABLE COLLECTION OF LOVE' printed across the front. If the High Command wouldn't listen, then he had to somehow convince the Queen herself..."

changelings_paxchrysalia.8.d:0 "Marsilio didn't know how he'd done it, but he had. Somehow, by pulling every favor he had to his name and arranging a few generous gifts that some less scrupulous changelings might call bribes, the Generaloberstabsarzt had arranged for his new protocols for love extraction to bypass the Changeling High Command and make it directly to the Queen herself. And even more amazingly, the Queen had apparently read through the proposal with interest and ordered it be implemented all across the newly annexed lands. Somehow, for once, reason had triumphed in the upper echelons of the Changeling Hives. It was enough to make Marsilio light a cigarette in celebration -- never mind that he'd quit two years ago.\n\nThe Seaddle Protocol, as it had been formally named, would be a radical change of the changeling love collection system, taking irregular and oftentimes life threatening harvesting and institutionalizing it as a regular part of life for those under changeling rule. Regular harvests every month would drain half of a population center of their love, leaving the other half to care for those harvested, until the roles would be reversed the following month. The semi-regular and harmless collections would be sufficient to keep the love flowing into the Hives as much as it was needed, without riling up the anger of those providing it to the collectors. After all, the benefits of stable changeling rule would more than outweigh a slight inconvenience every month when the love collectors came to town. Given some time, there wouldn't be any fuss about the quarterly harvests at all."

changelings_paxchrysalia.9.d:0 "Disturbing reports have reached us about an Equestrian town that was recently visited by members of the Queen’s Guard in western Equestria. The company, upon arriving at the town, immediately rounded up all the civilians present and brought them to the town square under threats of violence. Once there, the ponies were led off one by one into the local doctor’s office, where they were forcibly drained of every last ounce of love in their bodies until they were little but withered husks, like squeezing juice from a lemon. The bodies were found in an open pit behind the town, an undignified mass grave from nearly a hundred innocent civilians. Changelings and ponies alike throughout the Hives have been left horrified by the news, with many expressing their outrage against the Queen’s Guard itself. Generaloberst Dieter Heinrich, captain of the Queen’s Guard, defended the actions of his soldiers, claiming that they needed love just like any other changelings, and placing the blame on the ponies of Equestria for not being more compliant with ongoing love harvesting techniques, making regular harvesting more difficult than it needs to be. The Generaloberst then stated that love harvesting will continue as usual before abruptly ending the interview."

changelings_paxchrysalia.10.d:0 "Generaloberstabsarzt Marsilio watched from the side of the collection truck as the ponies were brought out into the town square of their village. Most watched the changelings gathered around with anxious looks, instinctively huddling closer together as they warily eyed the changelings manning the perimeter with rifles and machine guns. A few soldiers rounded up the stragglers hiding inside of their homes, and within an hour, the entire population of the town had been brought together.\n\nMarsilio kept a keen eye trained on the faces of the ponies as the changelings split the assembled ponies into two groups. Then, leading one group forward, they began to power up the machinery gathered around them. A pink glow surrounded the ponies, causing many to flinch or cry out... but their cries faded away into confused murmuring as nothing drastic or terrible happened. In a few seconds it was all over, leaving the assembled ponies looking a little sluggish and tired, but none the worse for wear. The rest of the assembled changelings dismissed them, packing up the equipment, and politely reminding the other half of the town that they would be back in a month for their turn. As the two groups reunited in the middle of town, surprised whispers bounced back and forth between them, with many ponies watching with disbelief as the changelings readied themselves to move on. There was even a little bit of laughter as the two sides shared a few embraces.\n\nMarsilio allowed himself the tiniest hint of a smile as he climbed back into the passenger seat of the collection truck. Laughter was good. That meant it hadn't been too traumatizing for those involved. And if the ponies were able to laugh about it once it was all over, then the next collection would be even easier. Given enough time, the simple love harvests would become just another part of life for these ponies."

changelings_paxchrysalia.11.d:0 "Panzerzugkommandant Gossamer watched the rails gleam ahead of her locomotive under the glow of the moonlight above, like two silver lines stretching into nothing beyond the locomotive's headlamp. Today marked the first test of the new armored trains that would ferry jägerbrigaden to wherever they would need to be deployed, to suppress the Equestrian resistance cells plaguing the countryside between Ponyville and the occupied pony capital. The narrow mountain passes and steep ascent up to Canterlot necessitated the use of armored vehicles able to defend themselves, and the small roads limited how much tonnage military trucks could carry to and from the city. But the rail lines were already there, and they were too difficult to access for any creature that couldn't fly, which meant they would be relatively safe from resistance operations.\n\nAt least, that's what Gossamer hoped. The locomotive under her command wasn't much of a war train; instead, it was an old passenger train covered with armored plating and a few installations for machine guns here and there. The real war trains would come later, though those were still being assembled. But it had speed, armor, and most importantly of all, mass, and while Gossamer worried about forcing the armored train to haul itself up the mountainside to Canterlot, she barely had to do anything except touch the brakes now and then when coasting down to Ponyville. And as the headlamp on the train illuminated a makeshift barricade assembled across the train tracks, and the haggard ponies armed with anti-tank rifles behind it, Gossamer soon realized that an abundance of mass was perhaps the repurposed Friendship Express' greatest strength. No sooner had the ponies began firing did Gossamer release the brakes, hunkering down in the cabin while the armored plates defeated the anti-tank rounds with deafening booms. A moment later, she faintly heard frightened screams over the sounds of the engine chugging in front of her, and the whole train shook and shuddered as its plow tore through the barricade, scattering pieces of it -- and presumably the ponies behind it -- across the mountainside. Whatever those ponies had been expecting, it obviously wasn't an armored train barreling down the mountainside at them. And though Gossamer kept her eyes open for any more barricades or ambushes along the rest of the tracks, she didn't see anything else out of the ordinary until she coasted to a stop in Ponyville."

changelings_paxchrysalia.13.d:0 "Generaloberstabsarzt Marsilio sighed and flipped through the binder of notes sitting in his lap as he awaited the decision of the Royal Court. Why did he even bring so many papers? He knew the Queen wouldn’t read a single one. Ever since Equestria had fallen, she’d been pushing off all her royal duties as queen of the changelings to go play conqueror in Canterlot, and it had taken a not insubstantial amount of effort on behalf of the Court to get her to return to Vesalipolis and attend to her duties back home. But if he could convince the advisors, however... oh, but who was he kidding? The advisors were all from the greater hives, places like Vraks, Ditrysium, Soryth, and even Vesalipolis itself. Surely none of the bugs on the Queen’s council had even heard of the no-name hive he was from.\n\nAt the very least, the proposals in his binder gave him something to do while the advisors debated his proposal. He flipped through page after page of notes, each one explaining in detail how the industrial capability of the Changeling Hives could be improved by allowing the workers increased access to love to make up for longer hours and more demanding work. Sure, it would pull love away from the military, but wasn’t keeping the machines of industry working even more important than supplying a few bugs on patrol? Not only that, but Marsilio’s thoughts were set in the future, once the garrisons could be scaled back and Equestria trusted to run itself. The initiatives he set forward today could go a long way toward building up changeling industry in the future...\n\nThe door opening startled him out of his thoughts, and Councilor Commoragh stepped forward, turning toward Marsilio. "Generaloberstabsarzt?"\n\n"Yes?" Marsilio responded.\n\n"Do it," was all the councilor said, before closing the doors and returning to the important business taking place inside.

Ever since the Seaddle Protocol had been fully implemented throughout the Hives, the efficiency at which the newly-established Kollektiontruppen could harvest the mandated love tax from the ponies and deer had only increased. The mandatory love collections, though overseen and enforced by armed soldiers riding into town on trucks, had largely gone off without any difficulties, apart from a few noted cases of exhaustion and dizziness in elderly ponies and deer, as well as among the very young. Marsilio scratched a few notes onto his clipboard as a teenage couple stood up from the collection chairs and staggered away, leaning heavily against each other for support. He’d seen enough collections by now to know that they would have to limit at what ages ponies and deer should be expected to pay the love tax. Making it mandatory at 18 and then ending it at 58 seemed to be the most reasonable age bracket to work with, as below and above that range, the nasty side effects of collection were more prevalent and often more impactful. Still, that gave the Hives forty years out of each subject to collect their love taxes, and so long as the worst excesses in the Heer were curbed, it would be sustainable for a long time to come."

Several Kollektiontruppen trucks waited next to the large tent, their reservoirs constantly being filled up with the harvested love of the prisoners as they were taken in for collection. When the prisoners were sapped of their love, they often had to be hauled out by changeling soldiers, where they were dumped on the ground a few meters away.

changelings_paxchrysalia.19.d:0 ""Easy, easy! Don't break the thing, that machine is worth more than you, your wife, and all the eggs she laid last spring!"\n\nFinicus Vesali slapped a hoof against his forehead and grumbled as the idiot drones he'd brought out of Main Hive Industries' factories in Soryth tried to drop a crystal enchanter into the back of a waiting flatbed truck with a crane. The delicate piece of industrial machinery, designed to enchant the crystal receivers of Equestrian magical weaponry, slammed hard against the bed of the truck as the crane operator let it down too quickly. A few bolts popped out of the base, rattling down the asphalt, and Finicus considered how lucky those drones were that he didn't have a pistol on his person at the moment. If he did, he'd shoot them all and then probably himself. Hopefully the afterlife was managed by someling more competent than these louts.\n\nTurning around, Finicus went back to the tent he'd set up outside the magical weapons factory in occupied Whinnyapolis, stepping out of the sun for a bit. As CEO and president of Main Hive Industries, it was his duty (and privilege) to disassemble the Equestrian factories that had been used against them during the Great War and haul their expensive machinery back to Vesalipolis for study. Though changeling science was, quite obviously, the best in the world, the Equestrians had gone down several different paths of their own research and industry, and if there was anything that the ponies had learned from their bumbling baffoonery that could benefit the Hives, then he had to find out. One such thing that they were particularly adept in was the mass-production of enchanted weaponry and supplies, both of which had been used to great effect against the Heer during the war. Hopefully, bringing the heavy machinery of this factory back to Vesalipolis would help unlock a few of their production secrets.\n\n"How much longer, Finicus?" another changeling in a suit asked him. "An hour or two more, and we should be finished," Finicus said, waving his hoof. "Then we can get this packed up and brought back to Vesalipolis for study."\n\n"But Bales is nearby," another bug on his industrial advisory committee said. "We have the trucks, too. We could just rip out whatever they have there and bring it back with us. We should take it as reparations from the ponies."\n\nFinicus sighed and glared at the bug. "Are you stupid or something? What can we possibly learn from a munitions factory? The only thing those factories produced in Bales were bullets, bombs, and shells."\n\nHe glared at the changeling that had dared to speak up and leaned in over the table. "We aren't pirates. We aren't lazy. We are the greatest innovators this planet has ever seen. Nothing is better than changeling science. That spirit of innovation led us to victory in the Great War.

changelings_paxchrysalia.21.d:0 ""How long does she intend to keep us waiting?"\n\n"I don't know, dear, but it shouldn't be long now."\n\nFinicus Vesali sighed and did his best to ignore the conversation between the two nobleponies behind him as he pretended to admire a portrait of the Great Queen hanging on the wall. He and several other changelings from across the Hives' economy and industry had been tasked with organizing a cabinet of valuable Equestrians who could play a critical role in collaborating with the changeling government in administering the newly-conquered provinces, but that had been a headache and a half and much too difficult for how much it was worth. Gathered in the sitting room behind Finicus were: a hoofful of minor Canterlot nobility, most prominent among them the House of Amethyst; a few deserters and former officers of the Equestrian Armed Forces who had pledged loyalty to the queen; and several of Equestria's richest businessponies, willing to be first in line to serve the new regime if it made them a quick buck. The cabinet, termed ‘The Advisory Committee of Equestrian Collaborationists,' or the ACE Collaborationists for short, were to be the changelings' trump card for making the rest of Equestria swiftly fall in line under their new rulers. But judging by the fact that the Lord and Lady of House Amethyst had the gall to complain about being kept waiting before their audience with the queen, in the capital of Vesalipolis nonetheless, left Finicus doubtful that the collaborationists would solve more problems than they would create. Still, queen's orders were queen's orders, and getting dirty with the Equestrians from time to time would be worth it for the business opportunities it afforded Main Hive Industries.\n\nThankfully, the doors parted, and all the idle chatter and murmuring in the sitting room stopped. "The Queen will see you now," a soldier of the Queen's Guard said as he stuck his head through the crack. That was all the signal Finicus needed to stop admiring the art and get the show on the road.\n\n"Right! Everypony, follow me this way," he said, moving toward the doors and gesturing for the Equestrians to follow him. "Now, I don't know how you idiots treated your princesses, but Chrysalis is a queen, and I'm hoping you know a thing or two about how royal titles work. That means behave yourselves, or you'll be going home to your families in a sandwich bag." When all he was greeted with were glares from the nobility or boot-licking grins from the businessponies, Finicus closed his eyes and turned around, willing to get this mess over with before he had to stick around for cleanup"

changelings_paxchrysalia.22.d:0 "Finicus Vesali stood before a map of Equestria spread out on a table in his office, his eyes scrutinizing the colored hashed lines that occupied different regions of the defeated nation. With a little pushing and bribery (and maybe a veiled threat or two), he had managed to get Main Hives Industry into a position to make the most out of the fallen pony country. Equestria was rich in resources, materiel, and industry, and the factories and cities it left behind would be excellent spoils to whoever could seize them. Finicus had made sure that Main Hive was first in line, and was able to secure exclusive rights to the newly created economic extraction zone centered around Canterlot and the neighboring states, as well as control over the important ports in Vanhoover. Other regions of the nation had been split between Mayfly Electronics, Nidhogg Industries, and many of the other changeling concerns, as every bug got their slice of the Equestrian pie. Now that the war was over, the other concerns and corporations were back to being competitors of his, their cooperation with Main Hive Industries no longer needed to beat Equestria down, and the future was ripe with possibility. A changeling with tact and a keen eye for business opportunities could make the most out of this new economic playing field, and no bug had greater tact or a keener eye than Finicus himself.\n\nHe opened a drawer on his desk and pulled out a bottle of cognac aged for forty years that he'd been saving for a special occasion such as this and popped the cork, letting the spirit breathe for the first time in decades. It was a good thing he'd told his secretary to clear his schedule for tomorrow because after celebrating tonight, he wasn't going to be in any shape to do work for at least a day or two."

changelings_paxchrysalia.23.d:0 "With the Great War over and the ink drying in the history books, it has come time to turn the Hegemony’s efforts from conquest to occupation. The newly instituted Aktionsplan Bedeckt seeks to make the most of the fallen remains of Equestria, gathering pony scientists from the ruins of their old nation and firmly encouraging them to share their research and discoveries with the Hegemony. To oversee the enforcement of the Aktionsplan, a committee of the top changeling scientists, army officers, and industrial leaders has been organized in Vesalipolis to determine where these efforts should be directed first. Named the Hegemony Science and Industry Research Compact, or HSIRC for short, the newly established board of directors has gathered to determine what should take priority in the salvage and recovery operations before the Equestrian scientists go into hiding and their research is destroyed.\n\nThe board, however, is heavily divided. Representatives from the Queen's Guard have insisted that the HSIRC prioritize military hardware and the recovery of advanced weaponry such as railway artillery and complicated electronics, while the high-ranking officers of the Heer have pushed back that the HSIRC should invest in rocketry and atomic science, as these frontiers will be the future of the battlefields of tomorrow. Still more demands have arisen from the sizeable faction of changeling industrialists and capitalists, who sense great opportunities for the Hegemony (and their businesses) in learning from the ponies and having them teach us their technology instead of scavenging for it like vultures. As the HSIRC bogs down into a stalemate between the three factions, a decision must ultimately be made to prove that the Aktionsplan Bedeckt can be successful."

changelings_paxchrysalia.28.d:0 "Generaloberstabsarzt Marsilio walked into the diner in downtown Seaddle and saw his colleagues had already secured a table. Waving to them, Marsilio quickly made his way through the diner and sat down in an empty seat at the corner of the table, sharing greetings with his friends. His mouth began to water when he saw that they had already ordered an appetizer, and he helped himself to a few bites. He had to admit, with all the time he'd been in Seaddle since the end of the Great War, Olenian food was really growing on him. Not to mention that there was something a little more filling about deer love than pony love...\n\n"Took you long enough, Marsilio," one of the changelings, R&D Lead Dr. Tasili, said. "Working late again?"\n\n"You know me," Marsilio said with a little laugh. "Don't want to disappoint the queen."\n\nTheir conversation wandered throughout their meal, the six changelings enjoying the chance to talk about their work and ideas without it being confined under the umbrella of business. If it wasn't for weekend evenings like this to relax and unwind, Marsilio knew he would have gone insane long, long ago. But as the conversation turned inevitably to the methods used to gather love from the Hives' new subjects, Marsilio frowned into his drink, the wheels in his head turning.\n\n"Marsilio?" Tasili asked. "What's wrong?"\n\n"I was just thinking to myself..." Marsilio began. "Why is it that we're able to form friendships with each other, discussing ideas freely as we are right now, but not with the creatures we feed love from? Why do we have to forcefully extract love from deer and ponies to survive? Would it not be simple enough to work more closely with them, to understand them better, to give and reciprocate what we take from them?"\n\nThe mood around the table shifted to one of unease. "Those are dangerous things to say," said Dr. Pedipalps, sitting to Marsilio's left. "Are you saying that changelings are... parasites? That our nature is inherently flawed?"\n\n"Maybe not so crudely, but that's the basis of the idea," Marsilio said. "And I think the sooner we as a species recognize this, the sooner we can adapt and survive. We must stop being parasites to make it into the future, otherwise we won't have hosts to feed on. We have to become symbiotes, not parasites, and establish some kind of cooperation with the other species. That is our only way into the future.""

He doubted that, but questions demand answers, and it was always a scientist's duty to find them. Hopefully the pony inside still felt the same way.\n\nWorking up the strength to push through the doors, Marsilio stepped inside and spotted his target: a blue stallion with a white mane sitting in a booth in the corner of the cafe. He wasted no time in approaching the booth, though he slowed as he approached so the pony could see him. Recognition sparked in the stallion's eyes, and he stood up, a genuine (if unsure) smile on his muzzle. "Marsilio?" the stallion asked. "Celestia, it's been too long."\n\n"Likewise, Spectrograph," Marsilio said, shaking the stallion's hoof. "Though I'd caution against saying that name in particular too loudly."\n\nSpectrograph seemed to remember himself, and shook his head. "Right, right. Your queen doesn't want anypony to remember that the princesses even existed."\n\n"Our queen," Marsilio reiterated, gesturing to Spectrograph as well. "Not just mine, anymore."\n\nSpectrograph's smile turned to a frown. "You know I can't forgive your kind for what they just did to mine. I'm only here because we used to be friends and colleagues before everything went to Tartarus. So, what do you want?"\n\nMarsilio sighed, unhappy that the friendly atmosphere had broken down so quickly, but he nevertheless pulled a small packet of papers out of his bag and put them in front of Spectrograph. "Read it," he said, "and tell me what you think."\n\nSpectrograph looked between the papers and Marsilio for a few moments before he pulled out his reading glasses and set to work. Several minutes of silence passed by as the stallion read through the papers, his brow furrowing ever slightly more with each passing paragraph. Finally, however, he took off his glasses and looked at Marsilio. "What is this? Some kind of manifesto?"\n\n"Changelings and ponies don't have to be parasites and hosts," Marsilio said. "One day, maybe we can be symbiotic. Mutually beneficial. At least, that's what I hope." He took the papers back and tugged them safely inside his bag, then tapped his hooves together. "So? What do you think? Would you be willing to help out?"\n\nSpectrograph struggled with that question for several seconds before fixing Marsilio with a piercing glare. "When Equestria fell, I swore to never help your kind hold my nation," he said, his voice bitter. But then he sighed. "But this would help Equestria too." After a moment to chew on his lip, he nodded to Marsilio. "You're a good scientest, Marsilio, and you've always been mindful of how your research affects those around you. If there was anyling I'd trust to make something better out of this mess, it's you.""

changelings_paxchrysalia.31.d:0 "Generalmajor Jachs observed the approach of the Equestrian High Command with narrowed eyes. These were the ponies he had fought against in the Great War, their strategies that he and the rest of the Heer had to overcome. Or at least, some of them were. Most of the actual Equestrian High Command had fled or gone into hiding when the nation collapsed, and the generals standing before him were barely more than toadies elevated to their posts to be subservient to the Hegemony. Never was that more obvious than today, where Queen Chrysalis had ordered that the Royal Guard and the Equestrian High Command sign a treaty with the Hegemony affirming Equestria's perpetual alliance and friendship toward their conquerors. It was a farce, he knew, about as legitimate as any drone shapeshifting into the queen herself and proclaiming that the Hegemony was now theirs to rule. But the legitimacy didn't matter much when the same hoof that created the treaty wrote the history books.\n\nJachs' mood didn't improve during the celebration afterwards, if one could call it that. He had important work that he needed to finish, and the last thing he wanted to do was mingle with Chrysalis and her Queen's Guard. All that would accomplish would be straining his patience listening to suckups try to smother the queen with platitudes and compliments for hours on end. Instead, he hung around the fringes of the party, where he noticed a pony watching him from a few steps away.\n\n"What is it?" Jachs asked, barely even looking at the pony. "Is there something I can help you with?"\n\nThe pony flinched, surprised that Jachs had acknowledged him, and cleared his throat. "I... well, you were present at the signing today, weren't you, sir?"\n\n"I was, unfortunately," Jachs groaned. He turned to face the pony. "What about it?"\n\nAfter looking around as if worried that he was being watched, the pony closed the distance between the two. "Do you really think that there can ever be true friendship between our species?" he asked. "Or was this all just for show with no truth to it?""

"Come in," he said, taking the opportunity to stretch and work some of the stiffness out of his joints. Oberstleutnant Alcippe stepped through the opening door, quickly saluting the Generalmajor. "The representatives from the EPSC are here, Generalmajor," she said. "Shall I send them in?"\n\nJachs sighed and rubbed a hoof to his temple. How he'd been dreading this meeting all day. "I'd rather you didn't, but I don't have much choice in the matter," he said, eventually dismissing her with a wave of his hoof. As Alcippe slipped away to fetch the representatives, Jachs sifted through the papers on his desk until he pulled out the Equestrian Penal Service Corps' recommendations for how to use Equestrian prisoners of war and criminals in furthering the economic interest of the hives. Once again, even briefly glancing through the callous proposal made his blood boil, but he tried not to let that emotion show as Alcippe knocked on the door again and opened it for the representatives to enter. He was an officer of the Heer first and a person second, and it was best to maintain that decorum.\n\nBut that didn't stop him from chastising the changelings in front of him before they could even sit down. "I've read through your proposal, representatives," he said, tapping the piece of paper on his desk, "and I have to say I'm disappointed in your behavior towards these ponies. Harsh quotas for labor camps enforced with physical violence and torture? No guarantees for necessities like food, water, and shelter? The seizure of any accused's property without trial or due process? If I didn't know any better, representatives, I'd be led to believe that you intend to make slaves out of our prisoners."\n\nThe harsh confrontation stopped the two representatives in their tracks, until the shorter, fatter bug, who Jachs felt looked remarkably like a maggot stuffed full with rotting flesh, put on a disarming smile and rubbed his hooves together. "Is it not what ponies deserve, Generalmajor?" the changeling said. "They dared to stand up to us during the war. Their soldiers killed thousands upon thousands of loyal changeling infantry. They had the audacity to cling to their useless princesses instead of accepting the right of our rule. Why should they deserve anything other than labor and servitude for their defiance? After all, it is what our queen wants out of them... though I suppose she left the final decision up to you, didn't she, Generalmajor?""

changelings_paxchrysalia.33.d:0 "Generalmajor Jachs stood in the shadows of the Canterlot Castle's gatehouse, with nearly five hundred ponies staging in the castle grounds behind him. There was a nervous excitement in the air, like the city itself knew things were changing, and none were more aware of that energy than Jachs. After all, this had been the culmination of his work these past several weeks. Now, it was time to show the world that changelings and ponies could cooperate.\n\nOberstleutnant Alcippe straightened Jachs' hat with a glow of green magic and grinned at him. "About time you get a parade for your work," she said. "The Queen will be pleased to see what progress you've made in making us accepted here in Canterlot."\n\n"Not just me, Oberstleutnant," Jachs said, nodding to her. Alcippe averted her eyes as if she were dodging the compliment, though Jachs reached out and patted her on the shoulder. "Reward yourself with some time off tomorrow, Alcippe. You deserve it."\n\nThere wasn't much more to be said after that, as the tolling of the noon bells in Canterlot meant it was time to set out. Jachs shared one last look with Alcippe before blowing into a whistle and setting the parade of pony volunteers moving, and he made his way to his staff car as the sergeants took command of the parade from there. It was going to be a long day of parade and ceremony, but for the first time in quite a while, the Generalmajor was looking forward to it. Hopefully the queen would be pleased with the results as well."

changelings_paxchrysalia.833.d:0 "Generalmajor Jachs had been expecting the summons from the Queen ever since he saw that grin on her face at the sending-out ceremony for the volunteers. Chrysalis had seemed thrilled to have ponies genuinely loyal to the Hegemony under her command, even if they weren't loyal to Chrysalis personally. That didn't bother Jachs, however, because he knew the Queen couldn't separate herself from the state in her mind, so she wouldn't recognize the distinction. All she cared about was that she had gotten ponies enrolled in her service without coercion or threats. That was a major win in itself.\n\nTwo members of the Queen's Guard opened the door as Jachs approached, obviously expecting his arrival, and he spared them a nod before he ventured inside. There, he found the queen sitting on one of the castle balconies watching the city of Canterlot far below as if she could see her new Royal Pony Volunteer Corps in action from this far up. The guard posted behind her banged the butt of his rifle against the ground, catching the queen's attention, and Chrysalis turned away from her view to regard Jachs with a smile. "Generalmajor," she said, gesturing for him to sit at a chair by her side. "I must say, I am impressed with what you've accomplished here in Canterlot."\n\nJachs saluted and approached at his queen's beckons, only sitting down when Chrysalis motioned a second time. "I've taken great pains to make the transition as smooth as possible," he said, back straight and posture stiff and formal. "The liberties and leeway I've afforded much of the population of Canterlot has eased tensions between our species."\n\nChrysalis scoffed at that, but she didn't reject the idea outright. "Perhaps you're onto something, Generalmajor," she said, much to Jachs' surprise. "Ponies serving in my Queendom out of their own free will..." Her wings fluttered with glee. "This is splendid. Absolutely splendid. Get me more, no matter what it takes. We need to show Equestria that this is their future, and if they fall in line, it will be glorious for all of us."\n\nChrysalis' words left Jachs surprised, but he didn't dare press her any further -- after all, her temper could change notoriously quickly. But they still had him wondering if today's success would finally show the Queen that harsh measures were the least effective way of earning the ponies' trust and loyalty."

The Great Queen had seen fit to summon him along with all the other generals and staff of the High Command to her tower to discuss a matter of great importance. What that matter was, however, the Queen hadn't said in her summons.\n\nFinally, Queen Chrysalis entered the room, causing Dieter and the other changelings to stand up and bow before her. "My Queen," Dieter said, rising from his bow. "How may we be of service?"\n\n"I need a new bodyguard unit," Chrysalis said, pacing in front of them. "I need a unit of thestrals to be added to my detail."\n\nThe request took Dieter aback, and he furrowed his brow as he tried to process it. "Thestrals, my queen? May I ask why?"\n\n"Because Celestia was never able to gain their loyalty," Chrysalis stated. "Having a company of bats as my elite Night Guards will prove to the ponies of Equestria that I am better than both of their princesses, because I will have the loyalty of ponies and thestrals alike!"\n\nUnnoticed by Chrysalis, the rest of the High Command shared wary looks. "It's... a good thought, my queen," Dieter began, carefully feeling his way forward. "But the thestrals... there is only one creature in the world that they will ever be loyal to, and that is their night princess. They broke with Equestria to side with her a thousand years ago, and in the millennia since, they've only ever been loyal to her, even as generation after generation was born, lived, and died while she was trapped on the moon. They are too ingrained in their devotion to Luna to ever be loyal to anyone else."\n\n"They will be loyal to me, their one true queen, before long!" Chrysalis insisted. "When they see that I have a loyal company of bat ponies in my guard detail, then they will realize that I am the mare they should worship, not that dreamwalking lunatic!""

His first thoughts as Queen's Guard Captain were focused on protecting his queen, and instincts honed from years of duty had him collect the pistol he kept in his nightstand and dart out into the hallway in seconds. He could hear gunfire coming from the throne room even as he tried to collect his bearings; whatever this attack was, it was coordinated, and a coordinated attack on the Queen's Tower could only mean one thing: assassination.\n\nDieter wasted no time sprinting to the throne room, where he witnessed a detachment of the Queen's Guard engaging in a brutal firefight with the newly-created Night Jaegers, the bats using the weaponry they'd been given to try and push their way through the Queen's bodyguards. Reflex sent Dieter diving toward cover at the side of the room, and not a moment too soon as bullets pockmarked the wall he'd been standing next to just a second earlier. Chambering the first round of his pistol, Dieter bared his fangs and poked his head out of cover, quickly sighting and dispatching two thestrals approaching his position with two rounds to each of their necks. Ducking back into cover, he took the time to look around and assess the situation. The Queen's Guard still held the advantageous positions in the throne room, and more were rallying to the fight from throughout the tower, but the thestrals had numbers and the element of surprise. He knew from creating and assigning garrisons that it would take five minutes for panzergrenadiers around the Tower to organize and respond to the attack; that meant he only had to keep the Queen safe for a few minutes longer before the thestrals would be outnumbered and crushed by reinforcements.\n\nOf course, that was easier said than done when he saw Queen Chrysalis herself step into the throne room, horn glowing with magic as she took in the carnage around her. "What is the meaning of th-!"\n\nDieter tackled her to the ground before she could finish her question, a hail of bullets ripping through the air around them. Chrysalis grunted and bared her teeth, indignant at being so brusquely knocked aside by a subordinate, but a furious scowl from Dieter silenced her. "Stay down and get out!" he shouted at her. "It's you they're after! Go! We'll cover you!"\n\nSomething in Dieter's voice dissolved any arguments the Queen might otherwise have had, and she scampered out of the room as Dieter and the rest of her bodyguards fell back to provide cover."

The brutal fighting left numerous changelings dead or wounded, and the thestrals, fighting in a defiant last stand in the name of their princess, were decimated almost to the very last. Those that weren't slain in the fighting only survived because their wounds left them too injured to continue fighting, and these survivors were soon rounded up by the Heer and dragged outside to sit in the courtyard until the Queen decided what to do with them.\n\nCaptain Heinrich sat against a wall in the throne room, drinking a cup of coffee someling had given to him while the Heer emptied the room of the bodies of both bats and changelings alike. His hooves still shook from the fight, and he doubted he'd get much sleep the rest of the night. If he could get his hooves on the necks of the thestral officers who organized the revolt, he'd tear their heads from their bodies just for ruining his night's sleep. Oh the things he would do to those damn bats...\n\nIt wasn't long before Queen Chrysalis herself made her way back to the throne room, a little shaken up but uninjured thanks to the swift actions of Dieter's hoof-picked bodyguards. Now, however, Captain Heinrich had no energy left in him to stick to formalities when addressing his queen. "The survivors are in the courtyard below. What do you want done with them?"\n\nChrysalis angrily scowled. "Kill them all," she said. "Except for the officers. I want them subjected to the cruelest punishment you can think of. Nobody betrays me and gets away with it."\n\n"Is it really treason if they were never loyal to you to begin with?" Dieter wondered aloud.\n\nChrysalis glared at him.

Bombers and brutal fighting in the city had torn the complex to pieces, with scarcely any building still standing without signs of catastrophic damage, but that was starting to change. As part of the post-war reconstruction of the fallen equine nation, the Hegemony had given its corporations and concerns almost free reign to claim land and rebuild the area as they saw fit. Alongside that, the Hegemony had made the local populations available against their will to the corporations to aid in the reconstruction, calling it a partnership between changelings and ponies in rebuilding the nation. But Finicus saw in Fillydelphia, however, was anything but. He'd left the supervision of the Main Hives Industries' involvement in the city to a regional director, and the changeling had made ample use of the Hegemony's offer. It seemed like almost every mare and stallion in the nearby borough had been dragged out of their homes and forced to perform the hard labor of clearing debris and hauling in new material at gunpoint, with soldiers stationed around the perimeter and on the rooftops of nearby buildings. Slowdowns were not tolerated, and he could hear exhausted ponies pleading for a break in the labor, only to be whipped back to their work, sometimes quite literally. It didn't take a genius to realize that the ponies here were little more than slaves, disposable tools acquired by the hives to toil and rebuild the nation on a foundation of their bones, all for the benefits of the changelings lording over them.\n\nChewing on his lip, Finicus eventually only shook his head and walked away.

changelings_paxchrysalia.38.d:0 "The Vesalipolis Office of Public Safety has recently started upscaling recruitment and training efforts to stuff its ranks full of trained infiltrators to disperse on deep cover operations throughout Equestria, with the intent on locating and cracking down on resistance groups and dissenters throughout the nation to tighten changeling grip on the land. What's more interesting is that the VOPS has made this public knowledge and disseminated it far and wide. The intended effect has arisen almost immediately: all throughout Equestria, ponies no longer trust their neighbors or POWs returning home from war out of fear that they could be changeling infiltrators. Resistance groups are struggling to grow in size as the fear that anypony could be a changeling makes them more cautious than ever. Pony unity against the Hives is hopelessly fragmented, making it increasingly difficult for Equestrians to come together and resist our rule. Outsiders are becoming ostracized within local communities at an ever-increasing rate, and communication across Equestria is beginning to slow down. All of this is making the nation easier to police and rule.\n\nWhat's more impressive is that this was all achieved with just a few words and no real actions. While the VOPS is indeed increasing recruitment and operations, it has nowhere near the necessary numbers to put deep cover agents in every community throughout Equestria. But word of mouth and the fear that anypony might be a changeling is proving to be just as effective, if not more so, than actually monitoring the entire nation with thousands of infiltrators. So long as we keep our true numbers hidden from the ponies, they will never be able to trust each other enough to resist us."

None of the accused ponies were given lawyers to defend themselves with, as no respectable changeling or pony could bear the thought of defending these reprehensible individuals, and many vehemently denied their crimes and called the tribunal nothing more than an obvious farce.

"Come in, Alcippe," he said, gesturing for her to sit in the chair across from his desk, and the Oberstleutnant complied without hesitation. "What is it? Hopefully nothing from Vesalipolis."\n\n"For once, no," she said, putting a binder on the desk. Jachs pulled it closer as she explained. "As things start returning to normal, it's time to start organizing a local governing body here in Canterlot and the territory we're administering. After all, we're both military changelings, not political beasts, and I don't think you'd be interested in running the day to day affairs of the regional government."\n\n"I do plenty of that already," Jachs said, pulling the binder closer and flipping through it. There were numerous changelings in the first dossiers, all notable or rising politicians back in the Hives, but then he noticed the pony dossiers behind them. "Ponies?" he asked, turning a wary eye toward his Oberstleutnant. "Are you sure about that? I'm not sure we're ready to turn over the reins just yet."\n\n"The sooner we can pull off an effective transition of power, the better," Alcippe countered. "The ponies will be more compliant if they see other ponies governing them, not us. It would also help us out if they're able to serve as an intermediary between the Heer and the civilians to make sure everybody's needs are taken care of in the end.

changelings_paxchrysalia.42.d:0 ""The Queen will see you now."\n\nGeneralmajor Jachs nodded as the Queen's Guard opened the throne room doors for him and stepped inside with strict military posture. Queen Chrysalis had returned to Canterlot as if it was a vacation home she couldn't stay away from, and it was his duty to report on his recent progress in administering the Equestrian heartlands while she stayed. He just wished she wouldn't use the throne room all the time. The massive hall was drafty and it echoed so badly it made conversation difficult, but Chrysalis was determined to sit on Celestia's throne whenever she had meetings as if it was hers by rights.\n\n"Generalmajor," Chrysalis said, regarding the approaching changeling. "I've heard interesting things since last time we talked."\n\nJachs hesitated mid-bow, then cautiously stood back up. "Only good things I hope, my queen."\n\n"That depends to be seen." Chrysalis raised a brow as she gestured for Jachs to approach. "I've heard that you've gone soft with the ponies here, that you've gone so far as to treat them as equals with us despite their status. What happened to the aspiring general who effectively managed to place infiltrators into the Royal Guard during the battle for this city? You were cutthroat and ruthless then, as I recall. What changed?"\n\nThat was a line of questioning Jachs wasn't prepared for. "I... don't quite understand what you're saying," he began, cautiously feeling his way forward. "I've always been loyal to the Hegemony, to you, my queen. All of your orders, I've tirelessly executed. Canterlot is more secure now than it was when I began my posting here."\n\n"Yes, but at what cost?" Chrysalis frowned at him. "Let me be clear to you, Generalmajor, I approve of your work, but I disapprove of your methods. Keeping Canterlot secure and compliant is what you were assigned here to do, not play nice with the ponies. They are worthless, they are beneath us, and they are little more than livestock for our harvests. You should be pressing them down with your hoof, not helping them stand alongside us. Do you understand?"\n\nJachs had to hold his disapproval in check and nod as Chrysalis expected. Following Chrysalis' wants would only reset all the progress he'd made in managing Canterlot these past months. "Yes, my queen."\n\n"Good." Chrysalis dismissed the topic with a wave of her hoof.

"What brings you here?"\n\n"I'm here to discuss the reports you received out of Whinnyapolis," Dieter said, pulling over the chair from the other side of Jachs' desk and sitting down across from him. "So, Trixie Lulamoon has been cornered after so long, eh?"\n\nJachs slowly sat back down in his seat. "Yes, VOPS has operatives that have successfully infiltrated her main cell in Whinnyapolis. They're tracking her movements as we speak." He hesitated, then added, "Where is the queen? I specifically requested to talk this over with her personally."\n\n"Queen's busy," Dieter said, grinning at Jachs. "I'm here in her stead. So, when are we attacking?"\n\n"Attack?" Jachs was taken aback. "We can't attack, not now! Now is the perfect time to seed more operatives into the resistance and prepare for a larger operation later. Captain, the only thing we'll attain by attacking now is sending her back to ground again. We can't afford to let that happen."\n\n"I agree with you," Captain Heinrich said. "That's why we need to attack now before she catches wind of us and goes to ground anyway. The longer this operation goes on, the more likely she is to figure out that there are infiltrators in her midst. We know where she is now. Why risk letting her slip away by waiting?""

Using information passed along by infiltrators in the city's main resistance cell, the garrison simultaneously hit dozens of different hideouts and operations centers across the city. The fighting was fierce, often spilling out into the streets and between buildings, as Panzergrenadiers and armored vehicles worked in tandem with the local garrison to level resistance strongholds and flush their Equestrians out of their holes. The resistance fought back with surprising ferocity, leveraging stolen changeling weapons such as anti-tank rifles and panzerfausts to inflict significant damage on the garrison, but by the end of the day, the smoke rising from across the city marked our success. The resistance cell in Whinnyapolis has been crushed, its survivors scattered to the winds, and our grip on the city is more secure than ever.\n\nHowever, the main objective of the operation, the capture of the resistance leader Trixie Lulamoon, ended in failure. The mare was able to evade our forces after a brief skirmish with panzergrenadiers at the main resistance hideout, inflicting numerous casualties in her escape. Though we have searched high and low for her, she is simply nowhere to be found, and has likely escaped the city by this point. It seems our chance at catching one of the masterminds of the Equestrian resistance has failed, and she will doubtless be more careful and more difficult to locate next time."

The operatives there had secured the latest drop-off of supplies and materiel, and were working closely to seed more infiltrators into the main resistance cell.\n\n"I don't know, myself," Jachs admitted, flitting his wings. "Captain Heinrich would rather go in guns blazing, but that isn't the right call."\n\n"You're right about that." Alcippe narrowed her eyes as she read over the notes and reports the VOPS operatives had sent them. "So, what now? We have more infiltrators on standby, ready to carry out our orders. Should we send them after Trixie directly, or take a more careful approach?"\n\n"We would benefit from getting more infiltrators into the cell," Jachs began, "but we'll hit a critical number sooner or later where we can't hide the fact they're compromised. We could instead try to get infiltrators closer to Trixie herself. That will give us better information on the resistance's plans and allow us to keep tabs on her directly. It will be more difficult, but it could pay off.""

These agents in particular were tasked with infiltrating the leading resistance cell and getting close to its leader, Trixie Lulamoon, but instead have ended up slain in the line of duty. We may perhaps never know what tipped Trixie and the resistance off that eight of the ponies in their midst were changeling operatives, but the elusive leader of the Equestrian resistance in Whinnyapolis has almost assuredly gone to ground now.

changelings_paxchrysalia.56.d:0 "Mayor Sunny Skies stood behind the podium and waited.\n\nHe had been waiting since earlier that morning. Truth be told, he'd been waiting for much longer than that. Ever since news reached Hope Hollow that the war was lost and Equestria had formally surrendered, he'd been waiting for this day. Not with anticipation and excitement, no, but with dread. Hope Hollow had been so far removed from the front lines that the fighting hadn't touched them. Though a few townsponies went off to fight, the town was too small for the recruitment officers to visit them. For the longest time, the only thing that reminded Hope Hollow of the war being fought far away were the reports on the radio coming out of Canterlot, until even those went silent.\n\nBut not any longer. Now, the changelings were coming to town to collect census information and an oath of loyalty from its mayor -- from him. It was his duty to give them a warm welcome, to put on his brightest smile and lick the boots of the conquerors. Obedience was expected, but loyalty would be rewarded. Hopefully, appeasing the changelings would see the ponies of Hope Hollow treated fairly. Tossing away whatever dignity he had left was the least he could do to see them safe.\n\n"Sunny?"\n\nSunny Skies jumped, startled by the sudden voice. He looked over his shoulder to see Petunia Petals anxiously rubbing one hoof along her leg. "Sunny... are they coming still?"\n\n"Yes," he said, sadly nodding. "They'll be here soon. They should be."\n\n"Oh." Petunia fidgeted in place, then cleared her throat. "Well, while you're waiting, do you want to get something to eat, hon? Torque Wrench has been grilling corn for us at the shop, trying to make the most of the good food we have before the bugs come to take it away, and you've been out here since the morning, don'tcha know..."\n\nThe mayor hesitated, not fully willing to abandon his post in case the bugs arrived, but his stomach prodded him otherwise. Had he even had anything to eat for lunch? Maybe a quick break would be for the best. Finally, he gave in and stepped away from the podium. "Okay, Petunia, that sounds good. I could do with some food, now that I think about it.""

"We've got plenty of doom and gloom in front of us, but for tonight, we can pretend we don't. We've got our friends, the ponies of Hope Hollow, all together one last time before the bugs show up. They can't take this from us, don'tcha know?"\n\n"Yeah... yeah, I suppose you're right," Sunny Skies admitted. He did his best to push his worries to the back of his mind, and the smell of grilled corn wafting out of Torque Wrench's shop helped with that as his mouth began to water. "Wow... smells amazing."\n\n"Tastes even better, too," Petunia said, giving him a nuzzle on the cheek before trotting inside ahead of him. Sunny absently smiled as he followed his wife inside of the workshop, just in time to hear her proclaim, "I've got him, everypony!"\n\nA chorus of cheers and chuckling broke out, putting Sunny Skies at ease as he moved into the back of the workshop where many familiar faces had gathered around a long workbench-turned-table. He saw Torque Wrench and Kerfuffle, Mr. and Mrs. Hoofington, Moody Root, and even the two aspiring pegasus speedsters, Barley and Pickle Barrel, and their parents. Their faces and so many more turned toward him as he approached, and happy little smiles decorated their muzzles. If it wasn't for the hushed atmosphere hanging over the meal, it was almost possible to pretend that this wasn't a last gathering of sorts between friends before life changed forever. Almost.\n\n"Hey, everypony," Sunny said, sheepishly letting Petunia lead him to a seat at the center of the table. "Smells good in here."\n\n"Oh, shut up, you," Torque said with a roll of her eyes, dropping a plate of grilled corn and mashed potatoes in front of him. "I may be a handimare, but cooking ain't one of my skills."\n\n"Oh, I beg to differ," Kerfuffle said, snickering. "Maybe you should consider changing careers!"\n\nAnother hearty laugh was had at that, the cheer pushing away the underlying tensions in everypony present. Sunny could see it in the way Torque shuffled from hoof to hoof, the way Kerfuffle kept fluffling up her wings, the way Petunia stayed glued to his side, the way the Barrel twins would stop their play every few minutes to look around as if they'd heard something. Nopony knew what the future would hold for the town of Hope Hollow, and nopony held any delusions that it would be better than Equestrian rule. But they would get through it together. That, Sunny Skies was certain of.\n\nSo he grabbed a glass of cider sitting in front of him and raised it into the air. "Come on, everypony. Let's forget about the bugs for now. Let's make tonight something to remember!""

Though Jachs wondered just why in the world Queen Chrysalis had ordered that a show of force be put on for a backwater that served as a stopoff point to Canterlot at most, he was not about to question his Queen's commands. At least he had Alcippe for company during the ride into and through town; the Oberstleutnant's presence and help in organizing his work had become a stable factor in his hectic life that he couldn't do without.\n\nStill, the two changelings maintained the strictest military professionalism as the column rode into the center of the town, with the glittery and gaudy Castle of Friendship looming in the background as occupation forces practically dragged the citizens of Ponyville out into the streets to listen to the Queen's speech. As soon as Chrysalis took to the podium set up for her in front of the castle, Jachs zoned her out, his eyes scanning the crowd for any hidden threats while his queen delivered a boastful and almost mocking speech to the ponies who lived in this small town. All he saw was a barely suppressed anger from the ponies forced to listen, but luckily none made any sudden movements or presented themselves as threats to the conquering queen. His confidence in the Queen's safety reassured, Jachs let his mind wander to later that evening, where hopefully he'd be able to get some much-needed sleep on the train ride back to Canterlot.\n\nBut as Queen Chrysalis wrapped up her speech, one line she delivered caught his ear. "And lastly, to show just how much your pathetic 'Magic of Friendship' has failed you, Twilight Sparkle's beloved castle will be leveled and replaced with a new administrative center for my empire, and my generals and I will be staying here to oversee its destruction personally."\n\nJachs and Alcippe immediately turned toward each other, the two officers sharing a look filled as much with dread as it was with surprise. "Did you know about this?" Alcippe whispered.\n\n"If I did, I would have packed for more than just a day trip," Jachs grumbled, looking back over his shoulder at the towering crystal structure behind him. "Why do I feel like this is going to be a massive pain in the shell?""

changelings_paxchrysalia.201.d:0 "Generalmajor Jachs and Oberstleutnant Alcippe stood behind a blast shield erected a few hundred meters away from the Castle of Friendship. The two officers had spent the entire week hastily organizing a demolitions team and requisitioning twenty-five tons of explosives to fill the Castle of Friendship with enough dynamite to level it flat, and now the fruits of their labors were about to pay off. Hopefully, with the castle destroyed, the two would be able to return to Canterlot and continue the important work that needed to be done there, instead of wasting time dealing with the Queen's vanity project.\n\nQueen Chrysalis herself stood behind the blast shield, eagerly shifting her weight from hoof to hoof, while her team of bodyguards prevented anybody, pony or changeling, from getting too close without her permission. Jachs turned his attention further behind her, where several reporters had gathered, along with pony onlookers whose curiosity had got the better of them and dragged them out of their houses to witness this historic event. Camera crews had positioned themselves on platforms further back to get a clear shot at the crystal castle as it crumbled into shards and glitter. At the very least, Jachs knew it'd be an impressive propaganda piece, both for here and back home.\n\nThen came the time to blow the charges. The demolition team hooked up the fuses to the blasting machine, and Queen Chrysalis herself pulled it closer with her magic. "To the end of the Magic of Friendship!" she proclaimed, a wicked grin on her face as she pushed the plunger down.\n\nAn earth-shaking boom blasted out of the castle, spewing dust and smoke into the air, and the changelings gathered around whistled and cheered while the ponies scowled or looked away. Jachs and Alcippe turned to each other and shook their hooves, smiling that the job was now done, until a bout of laughter broke out from the ponies behind them. Jachs turned his attention back toward the clearing smoke only to see that the castle still stood, a little bit blackened from the blast, but none the worse for wear. "Made in Equestria," somepony joked, earning another round of guffaws.\n\nQueen Chrysalis' eye twitched as she regarded the castle still standing like a defiant enemy mocking her. Snarling, she whipped her head around to stare directly at Jachs and Alcippe, who cowered back out of reflex. "More. Explosives," she growled, and then she walked away, her hooves angrily stomping across the ground."

Despite the best efforts of the censors, word had started to spread around the countryside that the Heer had failed to bring down the Castle of Friendship in the first go around, but after packing every nook and cranny of the castle with as much dynamite and TNT as it could hold, Jachs felt confident that this time they could bring the castle crashing down. This time it had to work.\n\nOnce more, the officers, Queen Chrysalis, and her bodyguard had gathered behind blast shields, ready to watch the structure crumble before the might of the Changeling Hives. This time, however, the ponies of Ponyville had been forced to stay inside of their homes, and no reporters were gathered to observe the demolition -- as confident as Jachs was that this time everything had to work, Alcippe had managed to convince him that maybe it would be best to play it safe. Doubtless a second failure would only make things worse for the Heer and the changelings as a whole.\n\nWhen the fuse was connected, Chrysalis wasted no time on ceremony or pomp, her slight scowl betraying her annoyance that there even had to be a second attempt in the first place. Snatching the blasting machine from the changeling bringing it over to her, Chrysalis slammed the plunger down, then immediately toppled backwards as the cacophonous explosion nearly ruptured the eardrums of everyling present, and the resulting shockwave shattered the glass windows of the buildings closest to the castle while nearly knocking over the blast shields. The ground shook like a tremendous earthquake had just rocked the town, and a colossal cloud of smoke and debris mushroomed up into the air. But when all the smoke and dust finally cleared almost two minutes later, the glittering branches of the Castle of Friendship defiantly stood tall, still unscathed by almost fifty tons of explosives.\n\nThe blasting machine crumpled in Chrysalis' magic, and a toss of her head spiked it into the ground, where the components broke and scattered everywhere. She stormed away without a word, rage making her shoulders tremble."

She’d arrived a few minutes late, which was completely unlike her, but she’d been so run down by trying to direct the resources of the Heer to complete one stubborn task that her two hour nap had turned into four by the time she woke up that morning.\n\nAt least neither Queen Chrysalis nor Generalmajor Jachs seemed to notice or care that she arrived a little late. The Queen and the top brass of the Heer stood assembled in a field glaring at the castle through binoculars. In front of them were the fruits of Alcippe’s work: over 1000 pieces of artillery and 100,000 high explosive shells, assembled and ready to begin firing. Alcippe couldn’t help but grimace as she looked at what the proud Heer had been reduced to. It was desperate and ridiculous, sure, but leveling a castle made out of crystal shouldn’t have been this hard!\n\nAlcippe approached Jachs and the queen, managing to force herself to perform an exhausted salute when Jachs spotted her. He gestured with a gossamer wing for her to approach, and when she did, he bit his lower lip with his fangs and shook his head. “I hope this works, Oberstleutnant...” he said. “I really, really hope it does...”\n\n”It will work!” Queen Chrysalis screamed, and Alcippe noticed that she and Jachs weren’t the only ones suffering for their failures. She grabbed one of the artillery officers standing nearby and pressed her nose against his as she bared her teeth in a remarkable display of fraying sanity. “Tell them to fire at will! Bring this accursed castle down!”\n\nThe artillery officer, startled and frightened, could only nod until the Queen released him, and then the command was passed down to the guns. The officers all put on their hearing protection and took a few steps back as the artillery pieces began firing shell after shell into the castle. Alcippe anxiously flitted her wings, desperate that so much firepower could achieve some effect, and she swore she could see crystal shards flying off of the castle amidst the smoke and debris from impact. But as salvo after salvo bombarded the castle and shook the earth like a terrible thunder, Alcippe’s hopes soon crumbled when she saw the castle still standing tall. And when the last shot was finally fired over three hours later, no discernible damage could be seen from so far away.\n\nJachs and Alcippe shared a look, each knowing that this meant even more work for the two of them, and in a rare break of professionalism, Generalmajor Jachs mimed pulling out his pistol and dashing his brains across the fields of Ponyville.\n\nAlcippe couldn’t help herself but chuckle. At least she had somepony else to suffer through this nightmare with."

changelings_paxchrysalia.204.t:0 "80 Centimeters of Armor Piercing Ordinance"
changelings_paxchrysalia.204.d:0 "Generalmajor Jachs didn't even know what day it was until Oberstleutnant Alcippe knocked on the door of the town hall office he had turned into his command station in Ponyville. When he opened the door, he found the exhausted Oberstleutnant looking back at him, too tired to even manage a salute -- not that Jachs cared anymore. "Is it ready?"\n\n"Yes. We should go or we'll be late," Alcippe answered, stepping back so Jachs could walk out of the office.\n\n"Then let's not keep our queen waiting for the next disappointment." Jachs took the lead out of the town hall and toward the rail lines, where the metal monstrosity loomed over the tiny train station. Somehow, Alcippe had managed to track down an 80cm railroad cannon that had been under development prior to the start of the Great War, and had commissioned a parallel line of railroad tracks to support bringing the behemoth to Ponyville. The monstrosity stood at over 12 meters tall and almost 50 meters long, making the heavy howitzers the changelings had brought in the previous week look like grub's toys. The gun crew had spent the previous half hour using a crane to load a single 80cm armor-piercing round into the barrel of the huge gun, that single shell weighing more than 7000 kilograms alone. What a thousand guns and a hundred thousand shells of high explosive couldn't accomplish, hopefully one massive gun and one massive shell fired directly at the trunk of the Castle of Friendship would send the whole thing crashing down.\n\nAs Jachs took his place a comfortable distance away from the oversized field gun and the deafening roar he knew was coming, he spied Queen Chrysalis herself standing on top of the beast, eagerly rubbing her hooves together. He looked around to make sure that no other changelings were within earshot, then turned to Alcippe and nudged her shoulder. "Think it's too much to ask that they launch her out of that thing?" he joked, earning first a surprised gasp from his fellow officer, then a snicker and a chuckle.\n\n"It'd be the end of our problems, wouldn't it?" she replied. But both officers put their banter aside as the gun crew moved to their ready positions and other changelings came closer. That left just the Queen herself and the crew standing on the firing platform, and after sharing some words with the artillery officer in charge, Chrysalis' green magic grabbed hold of a lever and yanked it back.\n\nThe shockwave chased the thunderclap of noise like a punch to the gut, staggering Jachs and Alcippe back as the massive gun recoiled on the rail tracks. The report of the shell impacting the Castle of Friendship was almost inaudible through the ringing in Jachs' ears, but he faintly heard the crash and shriek of metal and the detonation of an explosive charge in the distance. Yet when the smoke cleared, the only sign of damage on the Castle of Friendship was a scorched black ring dead center in the trunk, and a couple of shards of crystal filigree that had snapped loose from the ends of some of the smallest branches.\n\nJachs didn't need his hearing to know the Queen was less than pleased when she tossed the artillery officer off the firing platform of the gun."
changelings_paxchrysalia.204.a:0 "Just what will it take to destroy this thing?!"

changelings_paxchrysalia.205.t:0 "An Aluminum Thunderstorm"
changelings_paxchrysalia.205.d:0 "The air raid sirens snapped Jachs awake, years of instincts already sending him out of his chair and under his desk for cover as that horrible drone wailed throughout the town. He hunkered down for several seconds before he remembered that the war was over, and the Equestrian bombers had all been reduced to scrap metal long ago. But why were the sirens going off?\n\nOberstleutenant Alcippe barged into Jachs office, her officer's overcoat forgotten somewhere else. "We need to go to the bunker!" she shouted, running around behind the desk and dragging Jachs to his hooves. "Bombers are coming!"\n\n"Bombers?!" Jachs shouted, confused as he let Alcippe guide him along. "What do you mean? The war is over!"\n\n"The Great War, maybe, but not our Queen's personal war," Alcippe replied, taking Jachs over to the stairwell that descended into the town hall's basement and the bunker underneath. "It would have been nice if she'd given us more warning, right?" Other confused and alarmed changeling staff and soldiers ran about to and fro, trying to gather important documents before retreating below the building, a nervous chittering filling the building to accompany the wail of the sirens outside. And that was when Jachs heard it: the distant droning of a bomber wing, a hundred planes strong by the sound of it, making its approach from the west.\n\nThe two officers staggered down the steps together, reaching the armored door at the bottom of the stairwell and scampering inside right as the ground began to shake. They fell into each other's forelegs in a shadowy corner as they lost their balance, and there the two changelings remained for several hours, holding onto each other as the Luftwaffe's bombers pounded the town and the hated castle therein. Hour after hour after hour the explosions and shaking continued, only interrupted for a few minutes here and there as bomber waves cycled in and out of the airspace to unload their payloads. When it was finally all over, Jachs and Alcippe cautiously ventured their way out of the bunker together, only to find that half of the town hall had collapsed from a direct strike, and fires raged throughout Ponyville as the garrisoning soldiers struggled to control the blaze.\n\nAnd silhouetted against the dark of the night by the fires burning in town was a glittering castle surrounded by craters, a few unexploded bombs caught in its branches like metal apples."

changelings_paxchrysalia.206.t:0 "A Proposal for the Queen"
changelings_paxchrysalia.206.d:0 "Generalmajor Jachs wasted no time barging into the Queen's office before the Queen's Guard could stop him, ignoring the shouts of warning and the weapons trained in his direction. "My queen," he shouted, stomping up to her desk and barely managing a salute through his exhausted anger. "We need to talk!"\n\n"Back away, Generalmajor," the Queen's Guard captain, Dieter Heinrich, snarled. "Who gave you permission to--?"\n\n"Enough, Dieter," Chrysalis barked, sending Captain Heinrich wincing and bowing his head like a dog brought to heel. Then the Queen shifted her attention from the papers on her desk to the Generalmajor in front of her. "Respect your queen, Generalmajor, or this will be a very short conversation," she warned him.\n\nIt took all of Jachs' willpower to bite back an angry retort. Instead, he forced himself to close his eyes, take a breath, count to three, and then begin to speak. "My queen, sending bombers against Ponyville last week was an unacceptable danger to the lives of not only your soldiers but also the lives of your new subjects. The town has suffered extreme infrastructure damage in the aftermath. Half of the buildings burnt down in the blaze, and the other half suffered damage from the bombardment. Is destroying the Castle of Friendship really worth such collateral damage?"\n\n"Of course it is!" Chrysalis shot back. She stood up to her full, menacing height and slammed her forehooves down on her desk, leering at Jachs. "That castle was Twilight Sparkle's seat of power. It stinks of her presence, and it's a reminder to these pathetic ponies of how things used to be before we conquered them. Do you understand how dangerous such reminders are?"
changelings_paxchrysalia.206.a:0 "This could be going better..."

changelings_paxchrysalia.8206.t:0 "A Proposal for the Queen"
changelings_paxchrysalia.8206.d:0 "I do, my Queen, but--"\n\n"Obviously you do not!" Chrysalis cut him off. "So long as it stands, it will inspire rebellion and dissent, and all of your failed attempts to bring it down have only made us a laughing stock throughout Equestria. We must bring it down to show these ponies that nothing is beyond the power of the Changeling Hives!"\n\nJachs resisted the urge to point out that the bombing raid that practically leveled the town was her idea, not his, and took a step closer. "My Queen, it's become increasingly clear that some magic protects the castle, magic that ordinary weapons cannot overcome. Which leads me to believe that there is only one possible way to take down the castle, and if that fails, then it truly cannot be destroyed."\n\n"And what way is that?"\n\n"You must destroy the castle yourself," Jachs said, choosing his words carefully. "You bested Celestia in single combat in Canterlot after draining Shining Armor of his love for the harlot, Cadance. You were stronger than an alicorn that could move the sun. What could you possibly not accomplish if you used the love harvested from tens of thousands of ponies all across your new empire?"\n\nChrysalis seemed to turn that over in her head for a moment, practicality clashing with ego, before her ego won, just as Jachs had hoped. "Yes," she said, grinning wickedly from ear to ear. "It is the only way. Only a truly powerful queen could be rid of this menace once and for all." She clapped her hooves together and giggled. "Do it, Generalmajor. Let's make it happen.""
changelings_paxchrysalia.8206.a:0 "Whether this works or not, this will surely be the end of it."

changelings_paxchrysalia.207.t:0 "One Final Effort"
changelings_paxchrysalia.207.d:0 "Truck after truck of love harvested throughout Olenia and Equestria rolled into Ponyville over the past few days, all in anticipation for Queen Chrysalis' personal attempt to bring down the blasted Castle of Friendship. Generalmajor Jachs and Oberstleutnant Alcippe watched from a safe distance away as their queen made her way to the staging area where the trucks had been gathered, their reserves of love opened up all for her use. "I really hope this doesn't kill her," Generalmajor Jachs thought aloud. "If it does, Dieter will have my head."\n\n"At least you can get all the sleep you want when you're dead, right?" Alcippe joked, lightening the mood for a moment.\n\n"No guarantees our queen doesn't haunt my soul for eternity," the Generalmajor answered. Then his lighthearted smile disappeared, replaced by a stern and focused frown as Queen Chrysalis' horn turned green and she opened her maw to devour the pink streams of love she summoned forth out of the trucks. Jachs and Alcippe moved a little closer together as they anxiously watched the queen ingest the collected love of thousands of ponies and deer, both wondering if there was a limit to how much love a changeling queen could possibly consume and what would happen if that limit was reached.\n\nBut Queen Chrysalis soon proved herself once again as the greatest of the changeling queens when she emptied all the trucks without difficulty. Her body practically glowed with energy, her horn enlarged and her green chitinous armor on her back growing to protect her chest and shoulders. Then, after a moment to feel out her new strength, the Queen wasted no time launching herself head first at the Castle of Friendship, barging through the doors and unleashing all her magic inside of the structure. The ground shook and the windows glowed with green magic for what felt like hours as everyling present held their breath, waiting for Chrysalis to bring the castle down on top of herself, yet slowly but surely, the glow began to fade and the shaking started to subside. And at the end of it all, Queen Chrysalis staggered out of the castle, barely able to support her weight and collapsed from exhaustion on the ground.\n\n"She couldn't do it..." Alcippe observed, fangs teasing her lower lip.\n\n"No," Jachs agreed, "but I think this is finally the end of it.""
changelings_paxchrysalia.207.a:0 "It's over, Oberstleutnant."

changelings_paxchrysalia.208.t:0 "Castle Sweet Castle"
changelings_paxchrysalia.208.d:0 "Generalmajor Jachs signed off on the last directive for the refurbishment of the Castle of Friendship into a new administration center for the Equestrian heartland. With Queen Chrysalis' failure to destroy the Castle, the leader of the Changeling Hives had finally, reluctantly, admitted defeat. Since destroying the Castle was no longer an option, it would instead be covered in concrete to hide the original structure from sight and change the architecture to something resembling the buildings back in the homelands. 'Out of sight, out of mind' as the saying goes, and with a few last directives, anypony or anyling that mentioned the existence of the Castle of Friendship would certainly find themselves out of sight before long once the censors and secret police got wind of them. Jachs didn't care, though; that was a reasonable compromise to leveling Ponyville with thousands of strategic bombers.\n\nPutting the papers aside on his desk for later, Jachs slid out of his chair and went down the hall to where Oberstleutnant Alcippe had set up her office during the weeks they'd been stuck in Ponyville for their queen's folly. Alcippe had left her door open, though Jachs still knocked on it out of politeness when he stuck his head inside. The 'ling jumped at the sound, startled out of her important work, then scrambled to stand up and salute when she realized who had called on her. "Generalmajor!"\n\n"Relax, Alcippe," Jachs said, stepping into the office and shutting the door behind him. He sat down in one of the seats across from Alcippe and gestured for her to do the same, and the Oberstleutnant sat back down in her chair. "So, finally this whole mess is behind us," he said, leaning back in the chair and rubbing his eyes.\n\n"Yes, finally," Alcippe agreed. "I was beginning to think it would never end."\n\n"You're not the only one." Jachs yawned and stretched his wings, letting the flitter about to try and get his blood moving again. "I'm going to sleep for a week when we get back to Canterlot if I can get away with it."\n\n"I know the feeling." Alcippe fidgeted with some papers on her desk, then lightly cleared her throat. "So, Generalmajor... what do you need?"\n\n"Need? Oh, nothing," Jachs said, waving a hoof. "I just wanted to know if you'd be interested in some drinks and dinner tonight when you're finished with your work. I think we could both use some time to unwind."\n\n"Drinks and dinner?" Alcippe echoed. She took a moment to think it over before an easy smile appeared on her muzzle. "I think I'd like that a lot, Generalmajor."\n\n"Good. Oh, and one last thing." Jachs winked at her as he stood back up, a little fluttery feeling settling in his gut. "Let's see if we can get through the night without any titles, hmmm, Alcippe?"\n\nAlcippe abashedly smiled back and tried to hide her face by turning back to her work. "I'll try my best, Jachs.""
changelings_paxchrysalia.208.a:0 "I couldn't have survived this mess without her."

changelings_paxchrysalia.209.t:0 "An Old Foe Resurfaces"
changelings_paxchrysalia.209.d:0 "Generalmajor Jachs sifted through the latest reports coming in from across the Equestrian heartlands, looking for anything that needed his immediate attention. Most were just progress reports on various projects or updates from garrison commanders in their efforts to quell unrest throughout the Hives' new holdings -- nothing serious that required action for him. He did, however, notice a letter addressed from the garrison commander in Ponyville, the memo marked 'URGENT' across the front and back.\n\nSighing, Jachs opened it up, already expecting something inane to come from that backwaters town that had caused him so much trouble in the past, only for his eye to twitch at what he'd read. Apparently, the concrete facade that had been erected around the Castle of Friendship to convert the ridiculously indestructible building from sight had seemingly crumbled overnight, once again exposing the glittering castle to the residents of Ponyville. The commander supposed that it might have been the actions of rebels, though no such evidence had yet been uncovered, but Jachs wouldn't have been surprised if that was the doing of the tree itself at this point. Biting his lip, he ultimately decided against reporting anything to Vesalipolis to spare himself the headache of dealing with Queen Chrysalis' inevitable demands for something to be done, and instead wrote back a simple order to be delivered to the garrison commander: "Cover it up or something with a blanket. I don't care what you do, just make sure nobody talks about it."\n\nSatisfied, Jachs immediately tore up the memo from Ponyville, tossed the shreds into a dustbin, and then flicked a lit cigarette into the bin after them. Out of sight, out of mind."
