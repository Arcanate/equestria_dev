 ### FOCUS ###

 ### IDEAS ###
 PCB_equestrian_owned_industry:0 "Equestrian Owned Industry"
 PCB_equestrian_owned_industry_desc:0 "Puerto Caballo is a land of wealth, and Equestrian business-ponies have always seen it as such. Thanks to Equestrian investment, our nation has seen many modern advancements such as automobiles and phones, however most our industries, farms and mines are owned by Equestrian-based companies, giving foreign ponies a monopoly over our island."
 
 PCB_communist_sympathies:0 "Communist Sympathies"
 PCB_communist_sympathies_desc:0 "Far from the Princesses' gaze, poverty, corruption and social inequality have oppressed the workers, farmers and miners of Puerto Caballo. Inspired by Stalliongrad, the poor ponies have taken to communism and socialism as a way of looking for a brighter future.\n\nIn 1005, communist revolutionaries lead by Bagasse Coltstro attempted to storm a military barracks and incite a general uprising, fortunately the coup attempt was stopped with little violence and the perpetrators imprisoned."

 PCB_buckista_idea:0 "Buckio Buckista"
 PCB_buckista_idea_desc:0 "The Captain of the Puerto Caballo Royal Guard, he is a diehard Equestrian loyalist and dangerous player in Puerto Caballo's Politics. With the full support of the mainland's elite behind him, he continues to ensure Puerto Caballo remains a haven for Equestrian tourists and tax dodgers.\n\nBorn in the town of Fardo de Heno in 970. He grew up poor on a farm and at the age of 16 he joined the Royal Guard.\n\nIn the year 1,000, as a sergeant he lead a coup against the corrupt President Quesadilla during the chaos of Nightmare Moon's return. He was hailed as a hero by the ponies of Puerto Caballo and promoted to the rank of Captain of the Guard. Since then he has been a master manipulator and negotiator. Having secured the backing of the Canterlot, Las Pegasus and Manehatten elite, he continued to dominate local politics, removing any President that he didn't see eye-to-eye with."

 PCB_sugar_tax_for_schools:0 "Sugar Tax"
 PCB_sugar_tax_for_schools:0 "The unpopular sugar tax is being used to fund military run schools and to line Buckista's pockets."


 ### DECISIONS ###
 
 ### EVENTS ###
 caballo.1.t:0 "Bagasse Released from Prison"
 caballo.1.d:0 "Bagasse Coltstro and his brother have been released from prison today, having served their seven-year sentences for rebellion and violence. A crowd of cheering supporters waited for him outside the prison gates and he was quickly ushered to a nearby hall where he made a speech, thankfully shorter than his four hour speech he presented as his defence during his trial.\n\nHe announced the publication of his new manifesto that he had penned in Prison and his supporters had already printed. He also declared the formation of the Movimiento 13 de Junio, a new revolutionary communist party aimed at freeing Puerto Caballo from Equestrian capitalism.\n\nDespite his time in prison, it seems he is far from reformed. But without having committed any new crimes, all the authorities can do is keep an eye on him."

 caballo.2.t:0 "Election Year"

 caballo.6.d:0 "#TODO Despite recently leaving prison, Bagasse Coltstro has announced he is running for El Presidente! He has the support of the left wing factions amoung the poor."

 caballo.7.t:0 "Ban Coltstro from Running?"

 caballo.12.d:0 "The Captain of the Royal Guard was tried in court today. Despite the best lawyers money could buy, Buckista was convicted of rigging elections and corruption thanks to irrefutable evidence. He has been sentenced to jail, and is not expected to get out for a long time."
 caballo.12.a:0 "At least he can't cause trouble now."

 caballo.80014.t:0 "Military Coup in Puerto Caballo"
 caballo.80014.d:0 "Recent events in Puerto Caballo have shaken the country. The dust has finally settled and it would seem that the loyalist, albeit rather... undemocratic Buckista has emerged on top. What should we do? On one hand, he has been known to emphasize his loyalty to us, but on the other hand, if we endorse this unlawful coup, it might inspire other ponies to try the same@."

 caballo.80015.t:0 "Equestria Demands Buckista Steps Down"

 caballo.80016.a:0 "Oh? Okay then."

 caballo.80017.t:0 "Buckista Refuses to Stand Down"
 caballo.80017.d:0 "Buckista has responded in defiance, refusing to step down. Unfortunately, many wealthy business-ponies have ties to him, and if we were to take direct action, then they would most likely be very upset. What should we do?."
 caballo.80017.a:0 "Leave him be."
 caballo.80017.b:0 "Cut off contact."
 caballo.80017.c:0 "If he won't go, we'll make him go."

 caballonews.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]In a surprising turn of events, an alliance of senators in the Puerto Caballo house of Representatives pushed through the impeachment of President Ponsé Cocktail for various crimes relating to corruption. Citing his use of veto in the Sugar Tax law as one such example, they listed out various claims of his abuse of power and exploitation of state funds. The president was prevented from defending himself and pushed out of the parliament building.\n\nThe Captian of the Royal Guard, Buckista, has thrown his support behind Cuerda who was quickly sworn in as interim president.\n\nCuerda will become the 9th pony to lead the island since the fall of the dictator President Quesadilla 7 years ago."
 caballonews.1.a:0 "Yet another change in Puerto Cabello leadership."

A nation of peace and harmony where everypony was happy and need not worry about money, health or wellbeing.\n\nBorn in Sancti Stallion in 959, Ponsé has lived a lifetime of politics. Having both served in the House of Representatives and as they mayor of Puerto Caballo. Under his mayorship, corruption in the city fell and many public services were opened. Under the rulership of the dictator President Quesadilla, he was exiled to Manehatten only to return after the coup lead by Buckio Buckista. He was the founder of the Puerto Caballo Harmony Party and was elected President in 1006, the first free election since the dictator's fall."
 POLITICS_COLTSTRO_DESC:0 "Born in the town of Grano in 978 to a successful sugar cane farmer, Bagasse first became politically active while studying at the University of Puerto Caballo. He became highly critical of the government of the dictator President Quesadilla and even made the front page of several underground newspapers. This drew the attention of supporters of the dictator who began to threaten and bully him. This only drew him towards militantism.\n\nInspired by the works of Caramel Marks and Steel Stallion, he came to blame all of Puerto Caballo's problems on capitalism and the dictatorships of the bourgeoisie and that revolution was the only way to rid the island of cruelty and corruption.\n\nIn 1,004 he formed a group called the Movement and gathered fellow revolutionaries to support him. On the 13th June 1,005 he lead the group in an attack on the Royal Guard barracks in Luna de Compostela. The attack failed and he and his 122 supporters were arrested. Bagasse made a show of his trial, including a four hour speech defending his actions and denouncing the successive corruption in the Puerto Caballo government that gained him the sympathy of many ponies in the nation.\n\nHe was sentenced to 3 years in prison, but even behind bars continued his political activism."
 POLITICS_BUCKISTA_DESC:0 "The Captain of the Puerto Caballo Royal Guard, he is a diehard Equestrian loyalist and dangerous player in Puerto Caballo's Politics. With the full support of the mainland's elite behind him, he continues to ensure Puerto Caballo remains a haven for Equestrian tourists and tax dodgers.\n\nBorn in the town of Fardo de Heno in 970. He grew up poor on a farm and at the age of 16 he joined the Royal Guard.\n\nIn the year 1,000, as a sergeant he lead a coup against the corrupt President Quesadilla during the chaos of Nightmare Moon's return. He was hailed as a hero by the ponies of Puerto Caballo and promoted to the rank of Captain of the Guard. Since then he has been a master manipulator and negotiator. Having secured the backing of the Canterlot, Las Pegasus and Manehatten elite, he continued to dominate local politics, removing any President that he didn't see eye-to-eye with."

In 1003, Sandía was assassinated while in Abyssinia attempting to organise a communist uprising against the Storm King. Roca Roja became the chairman of the communist party and has since rebranded the party as the Popular Socalist Party in an attempt to win over more popular support those among the working class who disapprove of revolutionary action and still support the Princesses.\n\nRoca is often considered a coward or weak by some communists for his belief that the revolution should come peacefully rather than through revolutionary actions. This lead to a falling out with Bagasse Coltstro and his supporters."
 POLITICS_CUERDA_DESC:0 "Born in Remaredios in 945, he was an accomplished attorney and became the representative of his hometown in the house of representatives. A moderate he isn't a risk to any current institutions on the island."
