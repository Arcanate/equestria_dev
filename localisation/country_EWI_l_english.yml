windego.2.t:0 "Envoy of the Storm goes elsewhere"
windego.2.d:0 "In the aftermath of our refusal, an envoy from the Windigos approached one of our neighbors today with the same message from the monsters. This time, their offer was accepted. Let us hope this does not give our rivals the advantage."
windego.2.a:0 "Don't see why not."

windego.3.t:0 "Envoy of the Storm"
windego.3.d:0 "In the aftermath of their reappearance, we feared the worst from these so-called Windigos. Scholars are still debating about if they are the creatures of legend or merely imposters, but the fact remains that they are very powerful and deadly. After the destruction they wreaked, we feared for our safety. We need not have done so. An envoy approached our border today with a message from the monsters. They want to give us their territory as they have no use for it. It is, effectively, worthless land, but it might give us some advantage in terms of placing our troops."
windego.3.a:0 "Don't see why not."
windego.3.b:0 "Let it be someone else's problem."
