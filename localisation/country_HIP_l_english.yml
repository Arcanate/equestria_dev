 ### NAVY FOCUSES
 HIP_continue_navy_modernisation:0 "Continue Navy Modernisation"
 HIP_continue_navy_modernisation_desc:0 "Although our navy is already one of the most powerful in the world, we cannot afford to be lax. We must ensure our navy is always ahead of the competition. As an island nation, the navy will determine whether we live or die."

 HIP_deep_blue_war_games:0 "Deep Blue War Games"
 HIP_deep_blue_war_games_desc:0 "A strong naval doctrine is essential to success. Traditionally we have favoured striking our enemies' ships when they are in ports, but we do have other doctrinal options available should we wish to change our course. No matter what, we must choose a path."

 HIP_expand_the_marine_corps:0 "Expand the Marines"
 HIP_expand_the_marine_corps_desc:0 "When we must invade other countries, it will be the marines who will lead the way, and the landing craft that will carry them to safety. Naval invasions are a nightmare, but with grit and determination we can prevail."

 HIP_freedom_ships:0 "Freedom Ships"
 HIP_freedom_ships_desc:0 "Our civilian shipping industry is invaluable to our continued development. By producing more convoys, we'll be able to trade with our friends regardless of enemy raiding. As an added bonus, readily available convoys will make naval invasions faster."

 HIP_naval_radar:0 "Shipboard Radar"
 HIP_naval_radar_desc:0 "Radar will let us spot enemy ships through the worst conditions nature can throw at us. Future models may even be able to locate submarines or calculate better firing trajectories."

 HIP_royal_shipbuilding_committee:0 "Form the Royal Shipbuilding Committee"
 HIP_royal_shipbuilding_committee_desc:0 "Our many shipbuilders are skilled but disorganized. Different styles, gun measurements, and even engine designs prevail across the country. By forming a committee to centralise administrations and establish national standards, we can drastically speed up production."

 HIP_seapony_squardrens:0 "Seapony Squadrons"
 HIP_seapony_squardrens_desc:0 "We have a long and storied history of the use of submarines. By forming dedicated squadrons of seaponies to crew them, we can quickly adapt to looming problems with design."

 HIP_underwater_supremacy:0 "Underwater Supremacy"
 HIP_underwater_supremacy_desc:0 "As a nation of seaponies, we can afford to invest even further in submarines. As our submarines don't have to carry air, we can hide like ghosts. Our submarines will strike at any troop transports and escape into the depths. No one will ever be able to take our home from us again!"

 HIP_expand_the_escort_fleet:0 "Expand the Escort Fleet"
 HIP_expand_the_escort_fleet_desc:0 "When trading with other nations, it's absolutely critical to make sure our shipments arrive safely.

 HIP_battleship_primacy:0 "Battleship Primacy"
 HIP_battleship_primacy_desc:0 "The battleship is the ultimate expression of naval dominance, and the backbone of the navy. With a large enough battlefleet, no one will ever dare to attack us."

 HIP_imperious_class:0 "The Imperious Class Project"
 HIP_imperious_class_desc:0 "Our naval theorists have discussed a design for a new battleship. This proposed "super heavy battleship" will carry guns twenty-one meters long. It will no doubt be an enormous investment of resources, but when completed it will tear even the battleships of the future to shreds."

 HIP_air_sea_warfare:0 "Air-Sea Warfare"
 HIP_air_sea_warfare_desc:0 "As a people who can shift from soaring through the skies to swimming under the seas, it's only logical to focus our efforts on a navy that does the same. Pairing planes with boats will not only be a symbol of our unity, it will let us strike our enemies in their bases with ease!"

 HIP_rapid_strike_tactics:0 "Rapid Strike Tactics"
 HIP_rapid_strike_tactics_desc:0 "Our pilots will have to fly in quickly, execute their mission, and then return to the carrier to fuel up. We can accelerate this process by refuelling and reequipping in the air."

 HIP_naval_aeronautics_committee:0 "Naval Aeronautics Committee"
 HIP_naval_aeronautics_committee_desc:0 "With our new focus on carriers, we will also need to modernize our carrier planes. Forming a Naval Aeronautics Committee will help us move boldly into the future and strike any navy that dares oppose us."

 ### INDUSTRY FOCUSES
 HIP_seapony_primacy:0 "Seapony Primacy"
 HIP_seapony_primacy_desc:0 "We survived the Storm King's invasion by hiding underwater. The sea shelters us, and it must be the sea we rely upon going forward. Even with modern submarines, our enemies can't reach the sea floor, so we'll always have a safe place to flee to."

 HIP_hippogriff_primacy:0 "Hippogriff Primacy"
 HIP_hippogriff_primacy_desc:0 "We can't afford to cower in the depths any longer. The world is changing, and if we are to take our place as a preeminent nation among the peoples of the world, it's time to change too."

 HIP_expand_the_underwater_dockyards:0 "Expand the Underwater Dockyards"
 HIP_expand_the_underwater_dockyards_desc:0 "The underwater dockyards allow us to produce and repair ships away from our enemies. With a navy being repaired safe from all harm, we will be able to enjoy true naval supremacy, striking our enemies in port while our own ports are underwater."

 HIP_shell_oil:0 "Shell Oil Company"
 HIP_shell_oil_desc:0 "Although we have a reasonable amount of crude oil, it isn't enough to fuel our massive navy. We'll need to develop our oil refining process, and synthetic refineries are also worth looking into."
 
 HIP_support_the_oil_industry:0 "Support the Oil Industry"
 HIP_support_the_oil_industry_desc:0 "There's only so far we can get with improving refining. A great wealth of oil lies under the ocean floor, and we can tap into it with modern extraction. Synthetic oil has also been developed by some other countries of the world, and would help us supplant our natural reserves."

 HIP_national_road_network:0 "National Road Network"
 HIP_national_road_network_desc:0 "By constructing a nationwide road network, we can speed up all our future construction. It'll also be useful for supplying any military operations. It will move our society in favor of hippogriffs, however."

 HIP_underwater_railways:0 "Underwater Railways"
 HIP_underwater_railways_desc:0 "Building underwater rails will make future underwater construction much faster, and even help us build things on the surface should we desire to. It will move our society in favor of seaponies, however."

 HIP_department_of_commerce:0 "Form the Department of Commerce"
 HIP_department_of_commerce_desc:0 "While we are a modern nation, the fact remains that as the world changes at breakneck speed, we run the risk of being left behind. If we are to safeguard our technological advantage, we need to keep advancing."

 HIP_office_of_industral_sciences:0 "Open the Office of Industrial Sciences"
 HIP_office_of_industral_sciences_desc:0 "There are so many topics we can be investigating, from machinery to electronics to battleships to our own biology. We need to open a new branch of the government dedicated exclusively to research and innovation. This Office of Industrial Sciences will ensure we are never behind our peers."

 HIP_grand_alaudia_bauxite_mine:0 "Mine Bauxite in Alaudia"
 HIP_grand_alaudia_bauxite_mine_desc:0 "Airplanes require aluminium, and our armed forces require a mighty airforce. Our geologists have reported there are massive piles of aluminium in Alaudia. Although it will take time and effort, the rewards will be immense."

 HIP_defence_department_desc:0 "In a world filled with threats, we will need a strong army to safeguard our borders. This Department will both cover our army's modernisation and its central administration."

 HIP_modern_weapon_contests:0 "Modern Weaponry Contests"
 HIP_modern_weapon_contests_desc:0 "By holding contests for the best-designed guns and grenades, we can ensure top-of-the-line performance for all our troops. Soldiers are in short supply, so our guns have to be the best we can possibly make them."

 HIP_army_armament_bonds:0 "Armanent Bonds"
 HIP_army_armament_bonds_desc:0 "Selling bonds will help us raise the money to build weapons factories. In the event we're attacked, it'll also let us quickly liquidate our funds to shift civilian factories to military ones."

 HIP_continue_army_modernisation:0 "Continue Army Modernisation"
 HIP_continue_army_modernisation_desc:0 "As a small nation, we have always believed that our first and foremost priority for the army should be better guns than our foes. Some military theorists advocate for changing our course, while others say that what has served us well should remain. Either way, keeping our theory of war modern is absolutely critical in these times."

 HIP_fund_royal_island:0 "Fund the Royal Island Gunworks"
 HIP_fund_royal_island_desc:0 "We have long used cannons in our armies. Big guns let us blast our enemies from afar, keeping our own troops safe. Having Royal Island design new artillery will let us prepare for whatever our enemies throw at us!"

 HIP_army_motorisation:0 "Motorising the Army"
 HIP_army_motorisation_desc:0 "Any attacks on our soil will have to be quickly repulsed, and any terrorist action countered swiftly. Armored cars and mechanized troop transports will keep our soldiers safe as they go wherever they are needed."

 HIP_armor_training_school:0 "Armored Operations Training"

 HIP_royal_engineers_corps_desc:0 "Combat engineers can dig trenches, set explosives to breach forts, and operate flamethrowers to smoke our foes out. We must not neglect our engineers, especialyl the defenses they can give to protect our home."

 HIP_signle_and_logistics_school:0 "A School for Signals and Logistics"
 HIP_signle_and_logistics_school_desc:0 "Modern warfare involves more than guns and planes; it also involves distribution of goods and quick communication. Creating a school dedicated to these less visible but still vital topics will make sure we can synchronize and plan with lightning speed."

 HIP_invite_griffon_officers:0 "Invite Griffon Theorists"
 HIP_invite_griffon_officers_desc:0 "The Griffonian school of war has long been that maximal planning and preparation is the method by which victory is won. We can approach them for guidance on our own war machine to help us organize properly."

 HIP_lessons_from_the_enemy:0 "Lessons from the Enemy"
 HIP_lessons_from_the_enemy_desc:0 "The Storm King's tactics were brutal yet effective. Rapidly organized plans and swift offensives let him conquer most of Zebrica, and doing the same could let us take the fight to any would-be conquerors."

 HIP_grand_alaudia_training_grounds:0 "Training Grounds at Grand Alaudia"
 HIP_grand_alaudia_training_grounds_desc:0 "Grand Alaudia has both jungles and plains, and it's respectably distant from Mount Aris. Summoning our entire army there to practice war games, and then conducting extensive surveys on the experience of both foot soldiers and generals, will help us reorganize our army and refine our military doctrine."

 HIP_air_to_ground_warfare:0 "Air-to-Ground Warfare"
 HIP_air_to_ground_warfare_desc:0 "Paratroopers can land behind enemy lines and quickly disrupt their flow of supply. If we can capture their capitals and industrial centers, we might be able to win wars without ever firing a shot."

 HIP_special_service_force:0 "Special Forces Concentration"
 HIP_special_service_force_desc:0 "Special forces, from mountaineers to paratroopers to even more exotic possibilities like amphibious tanks, are a defining part of the [HIP.GetAdjective] military.

 HIP_jungle_special_forces_school:0 "Jungle Special Forces School"
 HIP_jungle_special_forces_school_desc:0 "Jungles are a nightmare to fight on for everyone. However, we have many jungles across our lands, and by training troops in jungle warfare, we can give our special forces a deadly edge in this dangerous terrain."

 HIP_mountain_warfare_school:0 "Mountain Warfare School"
 HIP_mountain_warfare_school_desc:0 "Mountaineers are a necessity on on any mountain terrain, and as our capital lies atop a great mountain, we'll need to invest heavily to protect it. Mountaineers can make the ost of our home, securing it against any attack."

 HIP_national_defence_draft:0 "National Defence Draft"
 HIP_national_defence_draft_desc:0 "In these terrifying times, we have to take drastic measures. [HIP.GetLeader] has, after extensive deliberation, decided to institute a limited draft.

 HIP_royal_legion_of_aris:0 "The Royal Legion of Aris"

 HIP_air_armament_committee_desc:0 "As the world recovers from the Storm King's defeat, it's more important than ever to make sure we have a strong air force to keep our people safe.

 HIP_air_land_warfare_focus:0 "Air-Land Warfare"
 HIP_air_land_warfare_focus_desc:0 "Any war must ultimately be won on land. By focusing our air force around winning land battles, we can push our enemies back whenever they advance, securing our borders forever."

 HIP_tactical_bombing:0 "Tactical Bomber Initiative"
 HIP_tactical_bombing_desc:0 "While we favor close air support to win land battles, tactical bombers are a necessity to cover other operations. They can execute any mission with reasonable effectiveness, from strategic bombing to close air support, and are thus wonderfully flexible."

 HIP_escort_fighters:0 "Escort Fighters"
 HIP_escort_fighters_desc:0 "Our bombers will need protection. Whether strategic bombers deep in enemy territory or CAS striking our straits, heavy fighters can reach across vast distances and defend bombers from local planes."

 HIP_consolidated_aircraft_focus_desc:0 "An airforce built for immense range will let us fight our opponents across the continents. The Consolidated Aircraft company has already offered to aid us in our development."

 HIP_fighter_working_group:0 "Fighter Working Group"
 HIP_fighter_working_group_desc:0 "Enemy bombers will inevitably target our homes and factories. We swam underwater to escape the Storm King's armies, but as much of our industry is on land, doing so is immensely costly. Building fighters will let us engage bombers before they strike our land."

 HIP_young_flyers_programme:0 "Young Fliers Program"
 HIP_young_flyers_programme_desc:0 "Are you doing your part? Our air force is the shield against our foes' bombs and the spear we ready against their charges. If we make this clear to our people, we're bound to have many young hippogriffs flocking to the air force!"

 HIP_rocketry_school:0 "Department of Rocketry"
 HIP_rocketry_school_desc:0 "Rockets—self-propelled missiles packed with liquid or solid fuel—have the potential to strike a base in the [CHN.GetName] from the comfort of our own mountain. A way to wage war without a single hippogriff or seapony ever having to leave home is incredibly tempting for obvious reasons. We need to find out more!"

 HIP_atom_committee:0 "Atomic Committee"
 HIP_atom_committee_desc:0 "Our scientists have long known that matter is made up of atoms. Recent findings suggest that certain atoms, in particular uranium and plutonium, can be split, and that such an event, properly controlled, could cause a chain reaction, unleashing incalculable destruction and loss of civilian life. We don't want to kill innocents, of course, but even having such a weapon could prove a mighty deterrant. In the long run, this weapon could aid the cause of peace."

 HIP_strategic_obliteration_doctraine:0 "Strategic Obliteration Doctrine"
 HIP_strategic_obliteration_doctraine_desc:0 "Victory in war can only be achieved by the total obliteration of our enemy's capability to wage war.

 HIP_bomber_offensive:0 "Bomber Offensive"
 HIP_bomber_offensive_desc:0 "The total destruction of the enemy's capability to wage war can only be achieved by increasing the size of our bomber fleet. More bombers means more bombs, and more bombs means fewer guns for the enemy."

 HIP_plecate_the_isolationists_desc:0 "The isolationist policies have long been championed by the seaponies, who view recent events as evidence that we should stick with isolationism instead of opening up. If we are to make progress, we have to make sure that they are placated."

 HIP_self_efficency:0 "Seapony Autarky"
 HIP_self_efficency_desc:0 "Hippogriffia survived for centuries on its own, and it would be beyond irresponsible to abandon this policy. Between invaders, slavers, mad foreigners and countless other threats, we must make sure to rally all the strength we possess for the benefit of our nation, not others'."

 HIP_anti_harmonic_activities_committee:0 "The Anti-Harmonic Activities Committee"
 HIP_anti_harmonic_activities_committee_desc:0 "Stalliongrad, Chiropterra, Griffonia, the Stormlanders: foreign ideologies and interests can be found everywhere, and many of these are driven by interests directly opposed to ours.

 HIP_committie_for_national_defence:0 "The Comittee for National Defense"
 HIP_committie_for_national_defence_desc:0 "War will come to our nation's borders once again, whether sooner or later.

 HIP_expand_the_royal_acadamy:0 "Universal Education"

 HIP_long_distance_friendship:0 "Long Distance Friendship"
 HIP_long_distance_friendship_desc:0 "We want to be self-reliant, but that does not mean that we are going to forget the friends we do have. Those who give kindness can be given it in return, and we will both be stronger for it."

 HIP_leand_lease:0 "Lend-Lease"
 HIP_leand_lease_desc:0 "Even if we cannot directly aid our friends in war, we can still make sure they are given the tools needed to finish the job. Our factories stand ready to churn out countless weapons needed, and our friends will have access to it for the lowest price we can charge."

 HIP_the_mountain_awakes:0 "The Mountain Awakes"
 HIP_the_mountain_awakes_desc:0 "We were asleep, but now we have awaken. The mountain is no longer silent, but it resonates with the sound of labour and preperations. Beware, all who would threaten us. We are ready for you, and we will be your undoing."

 HIP_traditional_studdies:0 "Never Forget Our Roots"
 HIP_traditional_studdies_desc:0 "We cannot, must not, forget who we are. To ensure this, our children will receieve a throrough education in our history and traditions, and all who wish to work towards its preservation and continuation will be given support in their endevours."

 HIP_youth_defence_league:0 "The Youth Defense League"
 HIP_youth_defence_league_desc:0 "We would never place our children in harms way, but in war there are many duties necessary, including several that will keep them able to aid in the struggle, but still remain out of the way of the actual fighting."

 HIP_never_to_fall_again:0 "As the War Approaches"
 HIP_never_to_fall_again_desc:0 "When the Storm King came, we could have lost everything. The next time war comes - and it will come sooner or later - we shall be ready to meet it with all the strength we have."

 HIP_trade_ports:0 "Designated Trade Ports"
 HIP_trade_ports_desc:0 "Contrary to what some claim, we are not looking to stick our heads in the sand and ignore the outside world. The cities of Winggarden, Howlington, and Canterford will be dedicated to trade with the outside world, and through it we can still be part of the world while watching its influence on us."

 HIP_agricultral_reforms:0 "Agricultural Reforms"
 HIP_agricultral_reforms_desc:0 "The agricultural sector has been left languishing in recent times. With all the development both internally and abroad, the time has come for a dedicated effort to make sure that our farmers can keep feeding our people even if the worst happens."

 HIP_encourage_private_enterprise:0 "Encourage Private Enterprises"
 HIP_encourage_private_enterprise_desc:0 "As our nation grows, so will its industry, but it'd only bloat the nation to try to run everything centrally.

 HIP_develop_our_outer_islands_desc:0 "Mount Aris is the gleaming jewel of Hippogriffia, but a jewel needs a necklace to hold it. Too long, we have ignored the golden ring of islands around us, and this must be rectified."

 HIP_encourage_tourism:0 "Come on Down to Hippogriffia!"
 HIP_encourage_tourism_desc:0 "Our home is among the most beautiful regions in the world, and visitors agree. Opening up for tourist enterprises will net us another source of revenue, as well as making sure that thousands of creatures across the world will go home with positive experiences of us."

 HIP_cut_industral_red_tape:0 "Cut the Industrial Red Tape"
 HIP_cut_industral_red_tape_desc:0 "Our industry suffers from miles upon miles of red tape. It might have been well-intentioned, but it is simply stifling us.

 HIP_organise_the_leftist_movements:0 "Organize the Left"
 HIP_organise_the_leftist_movements_desc:0 "The Left is a disparate group of young socialists, anarchist thinkers, and Posada's radical Revolutionary Workers' Party.

 HIP_hippogriffias_own_path_to_socialism:0 "Hippogriffia's Own Path to Communism"
 HIP_hippogriffias_own_path_to_socialism_desc:0 "Anarchism is an old tradition in Hippogriffia, so why should we turn the ideas of a madfish when we have something perfectly serviceable right here? Power will be devolved and the state abolished."
 HIP_import_the_revolution:0 "The Marksist Revolution"
 HIP_import_the_revolution_desc:0 "A stateless society is a desirable end, to be sure, but to get there will take a transitional dictatorship of the proletariat. It is absolutely essential that at this vulnerable time we not falter. Stalliongrad may have made some errors, but that simply means we must do better this time. After all, isn't dialectics the essence of communism?"
 HIP_the_triumphant_revolution:0 "The Revolution Triumphant"

 HIP_reorganise_the_armed_forces_desc:0 "Reactionary and monarchist thinking are disappointingly common among our air force, navy, and army.

 HIP_peoples_liberation_army:0 "The Revolutionary Army"
 HIP_peoples_liberation_army_desc:0 "The army takes, the army holds, and ultimately the army plants the flag atop the capital.

 HIP_committee_of_global_liberation_desc:0 "To have a revolution in one nation and not export it is the height of folly.

 ### EVENTS ###
hippogriff.1.t: "Hurricane!"
 hippogriff.1.d: "A devastating hurricane with sustained winds over 220 kilometres per hour slammed into Hippogriffia from Warzena and Chiropterra, with the heaviest damage done to East Aris. Although our ability to shift between hippogriffs and seaponies let us avoid any deaths due to flooding, it provided no protection against the trees hurled through the air or the gusts slamming us into walls. The death toll is thankfully low, although the property damage is devastating. The economic impact of this disaster cannot yet be calculated, and many seaponies are using it as an evidence that the surface is too dangerous."
 hippogriff.1.a: "So much destruction..."

 hippogriff.100.t:0 "Zumidian Tank Trials"
 hippogriff.100.desc:0 "Over the past few weeks, the army has been trialling various proposals for tank designs in Zumidia. After our victory over the Storm King, the army searched for the latest advances in land warfare from around the world. Of particular interest was Stalliongrad's use of tanks during their revolution. Royal Island Arsenal has been hard at work developing a series of proposed tank designs and experimenting with how best to integrate them into our land forces. The original T1 prototype was scrapped early in development, but the T2 and T3 prototypes are looking promising.\n\nThe T2 is a small and fast light tank with a crew of four. It has 16mm of armour and a max speed of 72 km/h on roads. The T3, however, is the exact opposite. A joint collaboration with Equestria, the T3 is designed with a crew of ten and has a maximum speed of 10 km/h over roads. With seven guns, it is built to overwhelm the enemy with superior firepower as it advances with the infantry, rather than outmanoeuvring the enemy lines.\n\nA third contestant had also entered the trials; Cross Tide, an eccentric inventor and racing car driver, submitted his own design based purely on speed. While more lightly armoured than either the T2 or T3, Tide's tank supports a crew of two, it is armed with a 37mm cannon, and has an astonishing speed of 120 km/h on roads. However, army analysts are not confident that it could stand up to any form of anti-tank weapons that it would be liable to face.\n\nAs the trials conclude, a decision must be taken. Which design will the army adopt?"
 hippogriff.100.a:0 "The light tank should be our focus."

His trusty custom-built aeroplane, the Spirit of Starfield, gleamed in the morning light as it taxied to its parking spot. His three-month solo tour of the world has been the talk of Hippogriffia, with many wondering what he'd discover beyond the borders of the island. His words to a reporter from Aris Post have been reprinted in numerous outlets, and his celebrity has turned them into a rallying cry for the isolationist elements within Hippogriffia:\n \n"There are many great sights in the wider world, Karthin chief among them, but I must say on the whole, the Storm King's barbarism is the rule rather than the exception outside of our fair nation. They have very little to offer us except for endless 'isms': communism, liberalism, republicanism, all ideas which griffons and even ponies kill each other over every day. We need to remain strong in the face of this violent new world, and reject these foreign ideas which would disrupt our peaceable way of life.""

She'd invited Skystar to speak with her, and had gotten some tea for the two of them. She paced about her office, checking the clock constantly until, two minutes after the scheduled time, she heard a knock on her door.\n\nSkystar walked in, wearing her communist party uniform with the same dignity with which she wore her old royal garb. Without a word she took a seat in front of Posada's desk, forcing the General Secretary to scurry to her own seat and sit down after her.\n\n"How is the revolution progressing, comrade Posada?" Skystar asked with stiff formality, pouring them each a cup of tea. Posada was flustered, taking a long sip of the mango-flavoured liquid to buy time. While she thought of her response, something cracked in Skystar's expression and she launched into a bubbly series of questions:\n\n"Did I get it right? Cuz like the revolution only started with overthrowing us right, cuz like you need to do so much work to build the new society and all? That's how that works right? We're still in a revolution right?"\n\nPosada spat out her tea. Once she'd finished laughing, she regained some of her composure and answered:\n\n"Well, yes! Yes that's exactly right. No hard feelings about the overthrowing part?"\n\n"Oh, many hard feelings! I was angrier than I've been in... well, ever. But those are in the past, and I've seen what you've been doing. I want to be part of it, if you'll have me."\n\n"Of course we'll have you!" Posada paused, chuckling to herself. "You know, when I was planning the revolution, I never expected I'd end up having a tea party with the princess."\n\n"Wait, did you just make me princess again?"\n\n"N- no, I mean-"\n\n"Well then it's just tea with a comrade, right?""

 hippocommie.7.t:0 "The Fate of Chiropterra"
 hippocommie.7.d:0 "Posada hadn't slept in almost two days. The presidium had been endlessly debating what to do with the Chiropterran occupation zone, with the proposals getting more and more desperate as new facts about the depths of Chiropterra's crimes came to light. This was a society engineered from the ground up for a thousand years to be as ruthless as possible, and they had achieved a level of psychopathic disregard for life normally associated with serial killers across an entire culture. Given the depth of their crimes and the depth of their hatred for their occupiers, incorporating Chiropterra as an ordinary administrative region was out of the question. Whichever option was adopted, it would take generations to fully uproot the Chiropterran system, which had seemingly taken root in the minds of every Chiropterran citizen even with their government gone. Three proposals lay before the presidium, each sickening in its own way.\nThe first would represent a concession to absolute evil. There were two Chiropterran Moonspeakers, two out of the entire country, who had somehow twisted the Nightmarist faith into something resembling liberation theology. Posada could withdraw the majority of the occupation force and put these two in charge, although in order to actually administer Chiropterra they would have to use much of the old power structure, which meant letting war criminals return to their old jobs and potentially setting Chiropterra up to rise again and exact revenge.\nThe second proposal would mean remaining in the Chiropterran quagmire for generations. The creatures of Chiropterra would be mostly spared death, but the Nightmarist faith would be completely banned, even in its most casual incarnations, and the entire population of Chiropterra would be relocated to vast open-air reeducation camps, where the next generation would learn of the evils of the Chiropterran system so that they might grow up better than their parents. This was guaranteed to be met with massive resistance and  endless insurgencies, but its proponents argued that the first plan was naive and the third plan monstrous.\nThe third option was little more than genocide. Justice would be applied in its harshest form, with everyone above the rank of sergeant in their vast stratocracy shot. A blue terror of massive proportions would erase Chiropterra, with those who were not shot put into permanent reeducation camps. It was horrific, it was bloodier than even the Storm King's methods, but it would not waste her creatures' lives to save a nation which hated them."

 hippocommie.9.d:0 "One of many pet projects of the Experimental Weaponry Commission, Project SALVO was finally shelved today after half a year of research failed to produce a next-generation conventional assault rifle. Prototypes included triple-barreled rifles, fletchette guns, and all manner of other methods to increase rate of fire, all with the goal of creating a rifle that could fire off a burst of three to five rounds before the recoil from the first shot was felt. This comes as a great disappointment to Terrafin, who had hoped that by equipping every single soldier with advanced weaponry, Hippogriffia could inspire its recruits and strike fear into the hearts of reactionaries worldwide."
 hippocommie.9.a:0 "Damnit."
 hippocommie.9.b:0 "I don't care how much it costs, restart the program!"

 hippocommie.10.t:0 "Project SHATTER"
 hippocommie.10.d:0 "Project SHATTER has run into a slight problem: super heavy tanks create tremendous ground pressure, and in amphibious operations we rarely have the stable ground necessary for them not to sink into it. With added weight from snorkels, fully-sealed armor, and an amphibious engine, anything short of the solid basalt of the ocean floor will be unable to support it, making it rather useless for amphibious assaults. Terrafin has suggested that we take the extensive data from the project and apply it to a more traditional super-heavy tank, as without all the extra weight and complexity he could design a good tank, but some within the project insist that the concept is possible. In particular they point to the double-tread idea which performed well in models but has not been rigorously tested and would take extensive redesigning."
 hippocommie.10.a:0 "Go with Terrafin's idea and abandon the amphibious requirement."

 hippocommie.11.t:0 "The Weapon of the Future"
 hippocommie.11.d:0 "After a dozen failed prototypes, project SALVO has finally borne fruit! The rifle of the revolution will no longer fire lead or steel slugs, but finned sub-calibre darts made of pure tungsten. The new rifle can achieve incredible rates of fire, pierce enchanted griffonian armor, and in larger calibres even punch through light tank armor! Comrade Posada was thrilled to learn that it also had far greater range underwater than any conventional or magical rifle, and has ordered the rollout of the newly-named 'Caramel-pattern Flechette Rifles' to all branches of our infantry. The cost of the ammunition, being made of tungsten and soon perhaps even depleted uranium, would be prohibitive had we not already abolished money!"
 hippocommie.11.a:0 "A splendid design."

 hippocommie.12.t:0 "Project STARFIRE"
 hippocommie.12.d:0 "Our efforts have borne fruit! While we are unable to reach altitudes where we would be invulnerable to anti-aircraft guns, our new designs generate enough lift to get higher than most fighters can reach, forcing the enemy to attack us from below and making targeting difficult for even the most sophisticated AA guns. Alternately, we can use this additional lift to implement the expanded bomb bays recommended in the program, but the added weight would make our bombers unable to reach those higher altitudes."

 hippocommie.16.d:0 "It had been a rowdy session at the Supreme Soviet, and Posada had been worried that bringing Skystar along to watch was a mistake. She didn't seem to mind however, and was eagerly jotting notes down in her seashell-themed journal as the members argued. When Hard Line got up to speak, Posada knew there would be trouble.\n\n"Esteemed comrades," he began, "We must address a mistake which I believe this body made during the confusion of the early revolution, but which can be corrected if we act swiftly. We can hardly say that we are sweeping aside the old world if we allow not only capitalists but the royalty themselves to swim among us. We allowed rightist temerity to win out that day, and so I move to reopen the issue of Queen Novo, and suggest we follow what every successful revolution has done and have the primary symbol of reaction in Revolutionary North Zebrica executed immediately."\n\nPosada glanced at Skystar, noticing the young commissar had started to cry even as Hard Line was met with boos and hisses by most of the Soviet. Posada had to shut this down at once, and addressed him from across the room:\n\n"Comrades, please! Do not boo him, engage with him. Now, remember Caramel Marks said that it is a sign of weakness of a people to hold their enemy at their mercy and not exact revenge."\n\n"Exactly General Secretary, it was a moment of weakness-"\n\n"Wait!" interrupted Posada, "I am so sorry, esteemed comrades, that wasn't Caramel Marks, that was Beakolini." She heard a tiny giggle coming from Skystar, and continued, launching into a tirade at the momentarily dumbstruck Hard Line: "This body already made its decision, and it was in a moment of courage and clarity, not 'rightist cowardice.' The issue is closed. And the next time you propose murdering Comrade Skystar's mother, I would suggest you do it with more tact or we may have to suspend your membership in the Supreme Soviet.""

 hippocommie.17.d:0 "When she heard that the Lunar Legions had fallen, former-lieutenant Silver Spike had wanted to head into the hills with her husband Night Eye and wage a holy war of resistance against the communists. A fever had prevented her, and by the time she recovered the blue army had locked down her village. As she returned to her little home, her foals Agave Dew and Guava Drop ran out, babbling something about a radio announcement. She hurried inside to hear whatever bad news was coming.\n\nSilver Spike held her foals tight in her leathery wings as they listened, silently praying that the communists hadn't finally decided to torch their village, or take away her foals, or that she wouldn't be on the next list of 'war criminals' their endless investigations had uncovered. The message she was greeted with was nothing she had expected.\n\n"My friends," came the voice of the infamous radical Moonspeaker Dusk Wane, "It is time for us to leave our mistakes behind us. I have spoken with the communist leaders, and they have agreed to withdraw their forces and provide amnesty for those still fighting in the hills, so long as we accept our crimes and move forward to build a better Chiropterra."\n\nGuava Drop hissed, but Silver Spike shushed him. She'd always been at least slightly sympathetic to Dusk Wane's message, even if he did border on heresy.\n\n"We have been lost, my friends, for a very long time. I have been to old Tzinacatlia; our true faith is one of sharing, and tolerance of difference. Nightmare Moon shelters all, her light shines upon all, but we have been blinded by grief at our defeat and allowed bitterness to twist us for a thousand years. So I implore you, walk with me, walk with the hippogriffs, into a brighter future free of the poison of hatred."\n\nShe knew she should be outraged at the blatant heresy, but mostly she just felt relieved that the occupation was going to end and Night Eye would be able to come home. Her foals would grow up in a strange world, but not an intolerable one."

 ### LEADERS #####
 HIP_POSADA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 14th of May, 980 in Seaquestria.\n\n§YBiography§!: For most of her childhood, Posada was ostracised by her peers. But she liked it that way, it left her more time to explore and play with her imaginary friends. She became an apprentice bookmaker in her teenaged years and later joined her local finball team eventually representing her hometown at the Pan-Seaquestrian Finball Cup. When she first went to the surface, she looked upon the stars in wonder and often would spend a lot of her time sitting on clouds at night stargazing. It was on one such night she accidently drifted over towards Zebrican territory and was captured by the Storm King's forces.\n\nPosada was chained inside the cargo hold of an airship full of looted trophies and treasures from Colthage. During the long journey she suffered at the hands of her yeti captors, but one night she was able to break free of her shackles. Sneaking through the ship's hold, she was seeking to make a quick escape and then follow the stars home when a flash of green light caught her attention.\n\nThe light ebbed from out the crack in the lid of a large golden chest intricately carved with images of horned beasts and bowing goats. Unable to help herself, she broke the chains and opened the lid. What she saw would change her forever. Images flashed before her eyes. Images of things nogriff should ever know. Images of conflict, strife, poverty and the stars, so many stars. She saw galaxies at the scale of atoms. She saw the raw power of the stars. And more, much more, she could not understand.\n\nIt is unknown how she returned to Hippogriffia. Her mind was broken, and it was months before she could talk in coherent sentences again. Shortly after the Storm King's defeat, a copy of the works of Caramel Marks crossed her desk at work. She found the book as a symbol that she was destined to rediscover what the chest had shown her and to free everycreature from the shackles of capitalism and monarchy. She founded the Revolutionary Workers' Party and quickly started preaching her ideology to every hippogriff and seapony she could.\n\n§YPortrait By§!:  Neither"
