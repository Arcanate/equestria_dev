 ### FOCUS ###
 HIP_focus_tree:0 "Hippogriffia Focus Tree"

 ### NAVY FOCUSES
 HIP_continue_navy_modernisation:0 "Continue Navy Modernisation"
 HIP_continue_navy_modernisation_desc:0 "Although our navy is already one of the most powerful in the world, we cannot afford to be lax. We must ensure our navy is always ahead of the competition. As an island nation, the navy will determine whether we live or die."

 HIP_deep_blue_war_games:0 "Deep Blue War Games"
 HIP_deep_blue_war_games_desc:0 "A strong naval doctrine is essential to success. Traditionally we have favoured striking our enemies' ships when they are in ports, but we do have other doctrinal options available should we wish to change our course. No matter what, we must choose a path."

 HIP_expand_the_marine_corps:0 "Expand the Marines"
 HIP_expand_the_marine_corps_desc:0 "When we must invade other countries, it will be the marines who will lead the way, and the landing craft that will carry them to safety. Naval invasions are a nightmare, but with grit and determination we can prevail."

 HIP_freedom_ships:0 "Freedom Ships"
 HIP_freedom_ships_desc:0 "Our civilian shipping industry is invaluable to our continued development. By producing more convoys, we'll be able to trade with our friends regardless of enemy raiding. As an added bonus, readily available convoys will make naval invasions faster."

 HIP_naval_radar:0 "Shipboard Radar"
 HIP_naval_radar_desc:0 "Radar will let us spot enemy ships through the worst conditions nature can throw at us. Future models may even be able to locate submarines or calculate better firing trajectories."

 HIP_royal_shipbuilding_committee:0 "Form the Royal Shipbuilding Committee"
 HIP_royal_shipbuilding_committee_desc:0 "Our many shipbuilders are skilled but disorganized. Different styles, gun measurements, and even engine designs prevail across the country. By forming a committee to centralise administrations and establish national standards, we can drastically speed up production."

 HIP_seapony_squardrens:0 "Seapony Squadrons"
 HIP_seapony_squardrens_desc:0 "We have a long and storied history of the use of submarines. By forming dedicated squadrons of seaponies to crew them, we can quickly adapt to looming problems with design."

 HIP_underwater_supremacy:0 "Underwater Supremacy"
 HIP_underwater_supremacy_desc:0 "As a nation of seaponies, we can afford to invest even further in submarines. As our submarines don't have to carry air, we can hide like ghosts. Our submarines will strike at any troop transports and escape into the depths. No one will ever be able to take our home from us again!"

 HIP_expand_the_escort_fleet:0 "Expand the Escort Fleet"
 HIP_expand_the_escort_fleet_desc:0 "When trading with other nations, it's absolutely critical to make sure our shipments arrive safely. We lack many resources other nations enjoy, and to keep our war machine operational we must protect our trade routes. Modern destroyers will keep our convoys safe."

 HIP_battleship_primacy:0 "Battleship Primacy"
 HIP_battleship_primacy_desc:0 "The battleship is the ultimate expression of naval dominance, and the backbone of the navy. With a large enough battlefleet, no one will ever dare to attack us."

 HIP_imperious_class:0 "The Imperious Class Project"
 HIP_imperious_class_desc:0 "Our naval theorists have discussed a design for a new battleship. This proposed "super heavy battleship" will carry guns twenty-one meters long. It will no doubt be an enormous investment of resources, but when completed it will tear even the battleships of the future to shreds."

 HIP_air_sea_warfare:0 "Air-Sea Warfare"
 HIP_air_sea_warfare_desc:0 "As a people who can shift from soaring through the skies to swimming under the seas, it's only logical to focus our efforts on a navy that does the same. Pairing planes with boats will not only be a symbol of our unity, it will let us strike our enemies in their bases with ease!"

 HIP_rapid_strike_tactics:0 "Rapid Strike Tactics"
 HIP_rapid_strike_tactics_desc:0 "Our pilots will have to fly in quickly, execute their mission, and then return to the carrier to fuel up. We can accelerate this process by refuelling and reequipping in the air."

 HIP_naval_aeronautics_committee:0 "Naval Aeronautics Committee"
 HIP_naval_aeronautics_committee_desc:0 "With our new focus on carriers, we will also need to modernize our carrier planes. Forming a Naval Aeronautics Committee will help us move boldly into the future and strike any navy that dares oppose us."

 ### INDUSTRY FOCUSES
 HIP_seapony_primacy:0 "Seapony Primacy"
 HIP_seapony_primacy_desc:0 "We survived the Storm King's invasion by hiding underwater. The sea shelters us, and it must be the sea we rely upon going forward. Even with modern submarines, our enemies can't reach the sea floor, so we'll always have a safe place to flee to."

 HIP_hippogriff_primacy:0 "Hippogriff Primacy"
 HIP_hippogriff_primacy_desc:0 "We can't afford to cower in the depths any longer. The world is changing, and if we are to take our place as a preeminent nation among the peoples of the world, it's time to change too."

 HIP_expand_the_underwater_dockyards:0 "Expand the Underwater Dockyards"
 HIP_expand_the_underwater_dockyards_desc:0 "The underwater dockyards allow us to produce and repair ships away from our enemies. With a navy being repaired safe from all harm, we will be able to enjoy true naval supremacy, striking our enemies in port while our own ports are underwater."

 HIP_underwater_construction:0 "Underwater Construction"
 HIP_underwater_construction_desc:0 "Constructing buildings underwater makes them immune to strategic bombing. As long as Seaquestria stands with us, we will have an impervious industry."
 
 HIP_shell_oil:0 "Shell Oil Company"
 HIP_shell_oil_desc:0 "Although we have a reasonable amount of crude oil, it isn't enough to fuel our massive navy. We'll need to develop our oil refining process, and synthetic refineries are also worth looking into."
 
 HIP_support_the_oil_industry:0 "Support the Oil Industry"
 HIP_support_the_oil_industry_desc:0 "There's only so far we can get with improving refining. A great wealth of oil lies under the ocean floor, and we can tap into it with modern extraction. Synthetic oil has also been developed by some other countries of the world, and would help us supplant our natural reserves."

 HIP_national_road_network:0 "National Road Network"
 HIP_national_road_network_desc:0 "By constructing a nationwide road network, we can speed up all our future construction. It'll also be useful for supplying any military operations. It will move our society in favor of hippogriffs, however."

 HIP_underwater_railways:0 "Underwater Railways"
 HIP_underwater_railways_desc:0 "Building underwater rails will make future underwater construction much faster, and even help us build things on the surface should we desire to. It will move our society in favor of seaponies, however."

 HIP_public_infrastructure_works:0 "Public Infrastructure Works"
 HIP_public_infrastructure_works_desc:0 "We are a peaceful and isolationist people. It's only sensible to build better roads and bridges to improve our citizens' quality of life."

 HIP_bellbreeze_aircraft_corporation_focus:0 "Form the Bellbreeze Aircraft Corporation"

 HIP_air_industry_fund:0 "Expand Aircraft Funds"
 HIP_air_industry_fund_desc:0 "We need more fighters. They shoot down enemy bombers and escort ours to their destination. [HIP.GetLeader] has approved a special fund for fighters, using some of the royal treasury to personally cover costs."

 HIP_department_of_commerce:0 "Form the Department of Commerce"
 HIP_department_of_commerce_desc:0 "While we are a modern nation, the fact remains that as the world changes at breakneck speed, we run the risk of being left behind. If we are to safeguard our technological advantage, we need to keep advancing."

 HIP_office_of_industral_sciences:0 "Open the Office of Industrial Sciences"
 HIP_office_of_industral_sciences_desc:0 "There are so many topics we can be investigating, from machinery to electronics to battleships to our own biology. We need to open a new branch of the government dedicated exclusively to research and innovation. This Office of Industrial Sciences will ensure we are never behind our peers."

 HIP_grand_alaudia_bauxite_mine:0 "Mine Bauxite in Alaudia"
 HIP_grand_alaudia_bauxite_mine_desc:0 "Airplanes require aluminium, and our armed forces require a mighty airforce. Our geologists have reported there are massive piles of aluminium in Alaudia. Although it will take time and effort, the rewards will be immense."

 HIP_develop_starfield_steelworks:0 "Develop Starfield Steelworks"
 HIP_develop_starfield_steelworks_desc:0 "Nearly everything we produce needs steel, from shovels to battleships. Starfield is the center of our refining of iron ore into steel, so it's only logical to expand production there."

 ### ARMY FOCUSES
 HIP_defence_department:0 "Department of Defence"
 HIP_defence_department_desc:0 "In a world filled with threats, we will need a strong army to safeguard our borders. This Department will both cover our army's modernisation and its central administration."

 HIP_modern_weapon_contests:0 "Modern Weaponry Contests"
 HIP_modern_weapon_contests_desc:0 "By holding contests for the best-designed guns and grenades, we can ensure top-of-the-line performance for all our troops. Soldiers are in short supply, so our guns have to be the best we can possibly make them."

 HIP_army_armament_bonds:0 "Armament Bonds"
 HIP_army_armament_bonds_desc:0 "Selling bonds will help us raise the money to build weapons factories. In the event we're attacked, it'll also let us quickly liquidate our funds to shift civilian factories to military ones."

 HIP_continue_army_modernisation:0 "Continue Army Modernisation"
 HIP_continue_army_modernisation_desc:0 "As a small nation, we have always believed that our first and foremost priority for the army should be better guns than our foes. Some military theorists advocate for changing our course, while others say that what has served us well should remain. Either way, keeping our theory of war modern is absolutely critical in these times."

 HIP_fund_royal_island:0 "Fund the Royal Island Gunworks"
 HIP_fund_royal_island_desc:0 "We have long used cannons in our armies. Big guns let us blast our enemies from afar, keeping our own troops safe. Having Royal Island design new artillery will let us prepare for whatever our enemies throw at us!"

 HIP_army_motorisation:0 "Motorising the Army"
 HIP_army_motorisation_desc:0 "Any attacks on our soil will have to be quickly repulsed, and any terrorist action countered swiftly. Armored cars and mechanized troop transports will keep our soldiers safe as they go wherever they are needed."

 HIP_armor_training_school:0 "Armored Operations Training"
 HIP_armor_training_school_desc:0 "Tanks can punch through lines and quickly encircle enemies. Even if we choose to avoid aggression, tank destroyers are very useful for stopping our enemies' armored advances."

 HIP_royal_engineers_corps:0 "Expand the Royal Engineer Corps"
 HIP_royal_engineers_corps_desc:0 "Combat engineers can dig trenches, set explosives to breach forts, and operate flamethrowers to smoke our foes out. We must not neglect our engineers, especially the defenses they can give to protect our home."

 HIP_signle_and_logistics_school:0 "A School for Signals and Logistics"
 HIP_signle_and_logistics_school_desc:0 "Modern warfare involves more than guns and planes; it also involves distribution of goods and quick communication. Creating a school dedicated to these less visible but still vital topics will make sure we can synchronize and plan with lightning speed."

 HIP_invite_griffon_officers:0 "Invite Griffon Theorists"
 HIP_invite_griffon_officers_desc:0 "The Griffonian school of war has long been that maximal planning and preparation is the method by which victory is won. We can approach them for guidance on our own war machine to help us organize properly."

 HIP_lessons_from_the_enemy:0 "Lessons from the Enemy"
 HIP_lessons_from_the_enemy_desc:0 "The Storm King's tactics were brutal yet effective. Rapidly organized plans and swift offensives let him conquer most of Zebrica, and doing the same could let us take the fight to any would-be conquerors."

 HIP_grand_alaudia_training_grounds:0 "Training Grounds at Grand Alaudia"
 HIP_grand_alaudia_training_grounds_desc:0 "Grand Alaudia has both jungles and plains, and it's respectably distant from Mount Aris. Summoning our entire army there to practice war games, and then conducting extensive surveys on the experience of both foot soldiers and generals, will help us reorganize our army and refine our military doctrine."

 HIP_air_to_ground_warfare:0 "Air-to-Ground Warfare"
 HIP_air_to_ground_warfare_desc:0 "Paratroopers can land behind enemy lines and quickly disrupt their flow of supply. If we can capture their capitals and industrial centers, we might be able to win wars without ever firing a shot."

 HIP_special_service_force:0 "Special Forces Concentration"
 HIP_special_service_force_desc:0 "Special forces, from mountaineers to paratroopers to even more exotic possibilities like amphibious tanks, are a defining part of the [HIP.GetAdjective] military. We'll need to train more to cover our various operations and maximize the impact of our limited soldiers."

 HIP_jungle_special_forces_school:0 "Jungle Special Forces School"
 HIP_jungle_special_forces_school_desc:0 "Jungles are a nightmare to fight on for everyone. However, we have many jungles across our lands, and by training troops in jungle warfare, we can give our special forces a deadly edge in this dangerous terrain."

 HIP_mountain_warfare_school:0 "Mountain Warfare School"
 HIP_mountain_warfare_school_desc:0 "Mountaineers are a necessity on on any mountain terrain, and as our capital lies atop a great mountain, we'll need to invest heavily to protect it. Mountaineers can make the ost of our home, securing it against any attack."

 HIP_national_defence_draft:0 "National Defence Draft"
 HIP_national_defence_draft_desc:0 "In these terrifying times, we have to take drastic measures. [HIP.GetLeader] has, after extensive deliberation, decided to institute a limited draft. This decision is not taken lightly, but we must ensure the safety of all seaponies and hippogriffs. [HIP.GetName] will never flee again!"

 HIP_royal_legion_of_aris:0 "The Royal Legion of Aris"
 HIP_royal_legion_of_aris_desc:0 "We love peace, but in a violent world, sometimes the only way to preserve peace is to fight. The Royal Legion of Aris will preserve our rights and protect our home against anyone who would take it from us."

 HIP_air_armament_committee:0 "Establish the Air Armament Committee"
 HIP_air_armament_committee_desc:0 "As the world recovers from the Storm King's defeat, it's more important than ever to make sure we have a strong air force to keep our people safe. Whether that's fighters to protect our own airspace, or bombers to take out the enemy's ability to wage war, we have to be ready for whatever the world throws at us."

 HIP_air_land_warfare_focus:0 "Air-Land Warfare"
 HIP_air_land_warfare_focus_desc:0 "Any war must ultimately be won on land. By focusing our air force around winning land battles, we can push our enemies back whenever they advance, securing our borders forever."

 HIP_tactical_bombing:0 "Tactical Bomber Initiative"
 HIP_tactical_bombing_desc:0 "While we favor close air support to win land battles, tactical bombers are a necessity to cover other operations. They can execute any mission with reasonable effectiveness, from strategic bombing to close air support, and are thus wonderfully flexible."

 HIP_escort_fighters:0 "Escort Fighters"
 HIP_escort_fighters_desc:0 "Our bombers will need protection. Whether strategic bombers deep in enemy territory or CAS striking our straits, heavy fighters can reach across vast distances and defend bombers from local planes."

 HIP_consolidated_aircraft_focus:0 "Consolidated Aircraft"
 HIP_consolidated_aircraft_focus_desc:0 "An airforce built for immense range will let us fight our opponents across the continents. The Consolidated Aircraft company has already offered to aid us in our development."

 HIP_fighter_working_group:0 "Fighter Working Group"
 HIP_fighter_working_group_desc:0 "Enemy bombers will inevitably target our homes and factories. We swam underwater to escape the Storm King's armies, but as much of our industry is on land, doing so is immensely costly. Building fighters will let us engage bombers before they strike our land."

 HIP_young_flyers_programme:0 "Young Fliers Program"
 HIP_young_flyers_programme_desc:0 "Are you doing your part? Our air force is the shield against our foes' bombs and the spear we ready against their charges. If we make this clear to our people, we're bound to have many young hippogriffs flocking to the air force!"

 HIP_academy_of_air_sciences:0 "Academy of Aerial Science"
 HIP_academy_of_air_sciences_desc:0 "With new plane models rolling off the assembly lines, we ought to found a new academy dedicated to the theory of air warfare. We'll likely be able to research other, more esoteric technologies as well..."

 HIP_rocketry_school:0 "Department of Rocketry"
 HIP_rocketry_school_desc:0 "Rockets—self-propelled missiles packed with liquid or solid fuel—have the potential to strike a base in the [CHN.GetName] from the comfort of our own mountain. A way to wage war without a single hippogriff or seapony ever having to leave home is incredibly tempting for obvious reasons. We need to find out more!"

 HIP_atom_committee:0 "Atomic Committee"
 HIP_atom_committee_desc:0 "Our scientists have long known that matter is made up of atoms. Recent findings suggest that certain atoms, in particular uranium and plutonium, can be split, and that such an event, properly controlled, could cause a chain reaction, unleashing incalculable destruction and loss of civilian life. We don't want to kill innocents, of course, but even having such a weapon could prove a mighty deterrent. In the long run, this weapon could aid the cause of peace."

 HIP_strategic_obliteration_doctraine:0 "Strategic Obliteration Doctrine"
 HIP_strategic_obliteration_doctraine_desc:0 "Victory in war can only be achieved by the total obliteration of our enemy's capability to wage war. Without air bases, dockyards, railways, roads, mines, stockpiles, and industries they will have no capability to stand up to us and the morale of the enemy's population will plummet."

 HIP_bomber_offensive:0 "Bomber Offensive"
 HIP_bomber_offensive_desc:0 "The total destruction of the enemy's capability to wage war can only be achieved by increasing the size of our bomber fleet. More bombers means more bombs, and more bombs means fewer guns for the enemy."

 HIP_cluster_bombing:0 "Cluster Bombing"

 HIP_plecate_the_isolationists_desc:0 "The isolationist policies have long been championed by the seaponies, who view recent events as evidence that we should stick with isolationism instead of opening up. If we are to make progress, we have to make sure that they are placated."

 HIP_self_efficency:0 "Seapony Autarky"
 HIP_self_efficency_desc:0 "Hippogriffia survived for centuries on its own, and it would be beyond irresponsible to abandon this policy. Between invaders, slavers, mad foreigners and countless other threats, we must make sure to rally all the strength we possess for the benefit of our nation, not others'."

 HIP_anti_harmonic_activities_committee:0 "The Anti-Harmonic Activities Committee"
 HIP_anti_harmonic_activities_committee_desc:0 "Stalliongrad, Chiropterra, Griffonia, the Stormlanders: foreign ideologies and interests can be found everywhere, and many of these are driven by interests directly opposed to ours. We must carefully weigh these ideas, and determine which ones are a threat to our way of life and which aren't."

 HIP_committie_for_national_defence:0 "The Comittee for National Defense"
 HIP_committie_for_national_defence_desc:0 "War will come to our nation's borders once again, whether sooner or later.

 HIP_expand_the_royal_acadamy:0 "Universal Education"

 HIP_long_distance_friendship:0 "Long Distance Friendship"
 HIP_long_distance_friendship_desc:0 "We want to be self-reliant, but that does not mean that we are going to forget the friends we do have. Those who give kindness can be given it in return, and we will both be stronger for it."

 HIP_leand_lease:0 "Lend-Lease"
 HIP_leand_lease_desc:0 "Even if we cannot directly aid our friends in war, we can still make sure they are given the tools needed to finish the job. Our factories stand ready to churn out countless weapons needed, and our friends will have access to it for the lowest price we can charge."

 HIP_the_mountain_awakes:0 "The Mountain Awakes"
 HIP_the_mountain_awakes_desc:0 "We were asleep, but now we have awaken. The mountain is no longer silent, but it resonates with the sound of labour and preperations. Beware, all who would threaten us. We are ready for you, and we will be your undoing."

 HIP_traditional_studdies:0 "Never Forget Our Roots"
 HIP_traditional_studdies_desc:0 "We cannot, must not, forget who we are. To ensure this, our children will receieve a throrough education in our history and traditions, and all who wish to work towards its preservation and continuation will be given support in their endevours."

 HIP_expand_costal_fortifications:0 "Expand Coastal Fortifications"
 HIP_expand_costal_fortifications_desc:0 "Anycreature who sets a single hoof or claw on our islands will be met with resistance from the get-go. If they establish a beachhead, it might already be too late, so we must make sure they will never be able to."

 HIP_youth_defence_league:0 "The Youth Defense League"
 HIP_youth_defence_league_desc:0 "We would never place our children in harms way, but in war there are many duties necessary, including several that will keep them able to aid in the struggle, but still remain out of the way of the actual fighting."

 HIP_never_to_fall_again:0 "As the War Approaches"
 HIP_never_to_fall_again_desc:0 "When the Storm King came, we could have lost everything. The next time war comes - and it will come sooner or later - we shall be ready to meet it with all the strength we have."

 HIP_trade_ports:0 "Designated Trade Ports"
 HIP_trade_ports_desc:0 "Contrary to what some claim, we are not looking to stick our heads in the sand and ignore the outside world. The cities of Winggarden, Howlington, and Canterford will be dedicated to trade with the outside world, and through it we can still be part of the world while watching its influence on us."

 HIP_agricultral_reforms:0 "Agricultural Reforms"
 HIP_agricultral_reforms_desc:0 "The agricultural sector has been left languishing in recent times. With all the development both internally and abroad, the time has come for a dedicated effort to make sure that our farmers can keep feeding our people even if the worst happens."

 HIP_encourage_private_enterprise:0 "Encourage Private Enterprises"
 HIP_encourage_private_enterprise_desc:0 "As our nation grows, so will its industry, but it'd only bloat the nation to try to run everything centrally.

 HIP_develop_our_outer_islands:0 "Developing the Outer Islands"
 HIP_develop_our_outer_islands_desc:0 "Mount Aris is the gleaming jewel of Hippogriffia, but a jewel needs a necklace to hold it. Too long, we have ignored the golden ring of islands around us, and this must be rectified."

 HIP_encourage_tourism:0 "Come on Down to Hippogriffia!"
 HIP_encourage_tourism_desc:0 "Our home is among the most beautiful regions in the world, and visitors agree. Opening up for tourist enterprises will net us another source of revenue, as well as making sure that thousands of creatures across the world will go home with positive experiences of us."

 HIP_cut_industral_red_tape:0 "Cut the Industrial Red Tape"
 HIP_cut_industral_red_tape_desc:0 "Our industry suffers from miles upon miles of red tape. It might have been well-intentioned, but it is simply stifling us. Rationalizing the bureaucracy, doing away with some of the regulatory framework and consolidating the management of the remainder into a new organization will benefit our economy immensely."

 HIP_encourage_the_automotive_industry:0 "Encourage the Automotive Industry"

 HIP_equestrian_alliance:0 "Our Equestrian Friends"
 HIP_equestrian_alliance_desc:0 "Equestria is and will always be the shining beacon of Harmony in the world. As both our nations face looming threats from the Supremacists of the world, we should band together nation-to-nation, as our heroes once did during the Storm War."

 HIP_look_to_griffonia:0 "Look To Griffonia"
 HIP_look_to_griffonia_desc:0 "Griffonia has never been a particularly stable continent, but just across the narrow sea from us lays a nation which has risen to become a shining example of harmony.

 HIP_take_the_lead:0 "Take the Lead"
 HIP_take_the_lead_desc:0 "We cannot look elsewhere for leadership and protection. We must bring the light of Harmony to the strife-filled lands of North Zebrica, and for that we must take the lead and form a pact of North Zebrican nations committed to peace and justice."

 HIP_terrafin_mission:0 "The Terrafin Mission"

 HIP_cult_of_the_atom_desc:0 "Isn't there something almost transcendental about the eternal dance of fusion and fission? The beauty of a self-sustaining reaction, the four protium atoms slammed together into helium at the core of a star, these are more than merely interesting phenomena. They have an almost spiritual quality. Religion has long been sidelined in our state, and yet could faith find an atomic resurgence?"
 HIP_reason_and_logic:0 "Reason Above All"
 HIP_reason_and_logic_desc:0 "As magnificent as nuclear processes are, they are still entirely secular. One does not need to worship the atom to respect it, nor does one need join a cult to feel in harmony with the infinite. The scientific method shall underly society, as it does politics."

 HIP_multistage_detonations:0 "Multistage Detonations"
 HIP_multistage_detonations_desc:0 "While pure fusion weapons are likely out of reach for the foreseeable future, we can trigger a fusion reaction with a fission reaction.

 HIP_sunset_atoll_test_desc:0 "At long last, a prototype thermonuclear bomb has been developed, and a suitably remote, secret, and uninhabited island has been selected.

 HIP_universal_communist_goal:0 "A Universal Communist Goal"
 HIP_universal_communist_goal_desc:0 "Every communist worthy of the name desires an international revolution; so-called "national communists" are deluded at best.

 HIP_subvert_the_unions_desc:0 "Despite what many union-busting reactionaries say, unions are unfortunately usually not a fifth column ready to strangle the economy at a note from their internationalist associates.

 HIP_island_silos:0 "Island Silos"
 HIP_island_silos_desc:0 "Remote islands make for perfect places to put rocket sites. Closer to our enemies, and comfortably far from our home, they make both an appealing target for the forces of imperialism and can serve as a lure to draw them to us."

 HIP_iodine_and_lead_desc:0 "The aftereffects of atomic bombing, such as fallout and contamination, cannot be neglected.

Every bunker shall be made radiation-proof."
 HIP_air_raid_defenses:0 "Air Raid Defenses"
 HIP_air_raid_defenses_desc:0 "Every enemy bomber shot down is a life saved, and so we will require massive anti-air installations. Radar will also be necessary to accurately detect bombers ahead of time, as will modern fighters and to intercept them. Our ideal outcome is that our bunkers never need to see use."
 HIP_collapse_communism:0 "Preparing for the Collapse"
 HIP_collapse_communism_desc:0 "The fact of the matter is that in our bold aims, we run the risk of collapsing entirely. Should this come to pass, we must be ready to rebuild. The cause of international communism cannot be ended by the fall of one revolutionary state."

 HIP_cetacean_comrades_desc:0 "Dolphins are intelligent, communicative, social, and are likely sapient. Although communication has been difficult, we still have many avenues to try.

 HIP_first_thermonuclear_weapon_desc:0 "After the Sunset Atoll test, we witnessed the power of a device in the megaton range. But Sunset Atoll was just an experiment. Now it's time to build a weapon.\n\nLet us hope we never have to use it."
 HIP_thermonuclear_arsenal:0 "The Thermonuclear Arsenal"
 HIP_thermonuclear_arsenal_desc:0 "One weapon does not make an arsenal. Even as we prepare for what may be the final showdown between the great powers of the world, we must continue stockpiling more and more weaponry. Only when our atomic superiority is unquestioned will our ability to bring and keep peace be guaranteed."
 HIP_prepare_the_people:0 "Prepare the People"
 HIP_prepare_the_people_desc:0 "This war is likely going to wipe out a large swath of sapient life. It will be incalculably destructive. But it must be done, because if it's not done then the imperialists will keep the world as it is now, in its endless cycles of chaos and conquest. We weep for every life we must take, but we soldier on because the alternative is too awful to consider."
 HIP_investigate_the_esoteric:0 "Investigate the Esoteric"
 HIP_investigate_the_esoteric_desc:0 "Even as science conquers the world, there is still so much more we don't understand. Vast aspects of magic still remain the purview of individual sorcerers instead of being widely replicable, and other questions, such as if we are alone in the universe, have yet to be answered.

 HIP_mount_aris_radar_array_desc:0 "To properly stargaze, we will require a gigantic radio telescope atop Mount Aris. We will look to the stars and see if we find anyone else looking back at us! As a side effect, such a radar system will likely aid in detecting any hostile planes."

 HIP_post_terrestrial_manifesto_desc:0 "Our future, a future of revolutionary communism, is not chained to this world. Gravity's bonds can be broken.

 # Zebrica Mandate Focuses
 HIP_encourage_migration:0 "Encourage Migration"
 HIP_encourage_migration_desc:0 "Ain Trotgourait is a wonderful place to live. Why should we deny our citizens freedom of movement in our own land?

 HIP_wingnot_accords:0 "Revisit the Wingnot Accords"
 HIP_wingnot_accords_desc:0 "Our mandate was only ever meant to be a temporary measure to ensure the security of Hippogriffia and Zumidia. It's time to meet with Zumidian community leaders at their historic Wingnot Palace to work out the future hoof in claw."

 HIP_expand_highwing_mines:0 "Expand the Highwing Mines"

 HIP_ain_tougot:0 "Urbanize Ain Trotgourait"

 HIP_government_representation:0 "Zumidian Representation"

 HIP_north_zebrican_union:0 "The North Zebrican Union"

 HIP_withdraw_from_zebrica_desc:0 "As we learned from the Storm King's rampage, Zebrica is a dangerous place. We cannot risk entangling alliances on the continent, and so we should fully release Zumidia as a sovereign state. This is what's best for Zumidia too; they deserve to carve out their own destiny. Both of us will be happier as free, separate nations."

Although our ability to shift between hippogriffs and seaponies let us avoid any deaths due to flooding, it provided no protection against the trees hurled through the air or the gusts slamming us into walls. The death toll is thankfully low, although the property damage is devastating. The economic impact of this disaster cannot yet be calculated, and many seaponies are using it as an evidence that the surface is too dangerous."

 hippogriff.100.t:0 "Zumidian Tank Trials"
 hippogriff.100.desc:0 "Over the past few weeks, the army has been trialling various proposals for tank designs in Zumidia. After our victory over the Storm King, the army searched for the latest advances in land warfare from around the world. Of particular interest was Stalliongrad's use of tanks during their revolution. Royal Island Arsenal has been hard at work developing a series of proposed tank designs and experimenting with how best to integrate them into our land forces. The original T1 prototype was scrapped early in development, but the T2 and T3 prototypes are looking promising.\n\nThe T2 is a small and fast light tank with a crew of four. It has 16mm of armour and a max speed of 72 km/h on roads. The T3, however, is the exact opposite. A joint collaboration with Equestria, the T3 is designed with a crew of ten and has a maximum speed of 10 km/h over roads. With seven guns, it is built to overwhelm the enemy with superior firepower as it advances with the infantry, rather than outmanoeuvring the enemy lines.\n\nA third contestant had also entered the trials; Cross Tide, an eccentric inventor and racing car driver, submitted his own design based purely on speed. While more lightly armoured than either the T2 or T3, Tide's tank supports a crew of two, it is armed with a 37mm cannon, and has an astonishing speed of 120 km/h on roads. However, army analysts are not confident that it could stand up to any form of anti-tank weapons that it would be liable to face.\n\nAs the trials conclude, a decision must be taken. Which design will the army adopt?"
 hippogriff.100.a:0 "The light tank should be our focus."

 hipflavour.1.t:0 "Foreign Literature in Universities"
 hipflavour.1.desc:0 "Ever since we exposed ourselves to the outside world after our long sequester in Seaquestria, foreign products have been coming into Hippogriffia. Perhaps the most important of these are books, and the ideas they hold. From works of literature to science to philosophy, our younger generation are voraciously devouring this new reading material, and as they do so, they pick up some of these ideas and make them their own. Of greatest concern to us are the political ideas they have been absorbing: while Hippogriffia has always been a stable absolute monarchy, many among the younger generation are now discovering that there are other ways of organizing society, ranging from constitutionalism to republicanism to nationalism to even the most radical ideas, such as fascism and communism. Right now their curiosity is intellectual, but we know how fast these intellectual ideas can take hold, and the threat they could eventually pose to our rule."

Most of the membership of these clubs consist of curious young griffs prone to experimentation, as well as a few older ones who are dissatisfied with the monarchy and its handling of the Storm King's invasion."

 hipflavour.3.desc:0 "A group of veterans, protectionist economists, and community activists gathered together today to announce the formation of the Aris First Committee, a group "Dedicated to preserving traditional Hippogriffian values and protecting our economy from foreign takeover." The most prominent leaders were seapony Raft Wood and hippogriff flying ace Crack Lightning, who gave a patriotic speech at the opening of the committee:\n\n"Mt. Aris stands tall, and like the mountain we must stand alone. We cannot depend on foreigners to help us, and neither should they depend on us. We have always been strong, self-sufficient, and proud of our cultures and traditions, and the Aris First committee will see that that stays true into the 11th century and beyond."\nHe was met with thunderous applause, and launched into the second half of his speech with even more vigor: "Liberal intellectuals would have us believe that harmony means opening our markets and our borders to everycreature, or funneling money and resources into charity projects in the North Zebrican Mandate. I believe harmony means a well-ordered, self-sufficient society that looks after its own. Aris First stands for the auto worker who is tired of seeing foreign cars drive their wages down, for the veteran tired of zebras accusing us of cowardice when we defeated the Storm King, for the small business owner tired of competing with foreign conglomerates who cheat the market. More than that, Aris first stands for our culture, our values, our history, and for a bright future for all Hippogriffia!"\n\nMany newspapers have denounced Aris First as xenophobic, backwards, or fearmongering. Still, their membership is quickly swelling, particularly in Seaquestria where seaponies see very little to gain from international trade, as there are few foreign products they want and many are concerned about underwater manufacturing being unable to compete with industrial giants in Equestria and Griffonia."

 hipflavour.4.banned.desc:0 "Banning the socialist book clubs has not eliminated these ideas, it seems. Reports trickle in daily of these clubs organizing in the nooks and crannies of Seaquestria, and of more and more of our citizens gravitating towards this enticing "forbidden knowledge." From what little information we have on these meetings, their disdain for the government has grown since we banned them, and while they once talked of abstract ideals, they have now become more like conspiratorial groups plotting revolution.\n\nAmong the seaponies, the largest of these underground groups are anarchists, who who call for a complete abolition of the state and claim to represent the "natural way of life of the seaponies," advocating for democratic non-hierarchical school-based living. Meanwhile, the most popular group among hippogriffs is a communist faction which emerged around a charismatic and eccentric seapony named Posada, who claims that Hippogriffia is uniquely suited to achieving "a post-scarcity society" but only if it is revolutionized into a dictatorship of the proletariat.\n\nRecently, we have received a tipoff that the anarchists and communists are planning a conference to debate their ideas and form a coalition, presumably with the aim of combining their forces for some plot against the government."
 hipflavour.4.desc:0 "The socialist book clubs have begun spreading outside the universities, as idealistic students try to spread their ideas among the general populace. While many of these groups profess "harmonic socialist" and "democratic socialist" ideals and want to work with the government to implement socialist economics in Hippogriffia, there is an undercurrent of sedition in these groups, as they all want at least as much devolution of power away from the monarchy as the liberals do.\n\nMore alarmingly, some of these groups openly call for the complete transformation of Hippogriffia. These more radical groups are gaining popularity among the poorer seaponies and hippogriffs who are skeptical of the possibility of reform. The largest of these radicals among the seaponies are anarchists, who call for a complete abolition of the state and claim to represent the "natural way of life of the seaponies," advocating for democratic non-hierarchical school-based living. Meanwhile, the most popular group among hippogriffs is a communist faction which emerged around a charismatic and eccentric seapony named Posada, who claims that Hippogriffia is uniquely suited to achieving a "post-scarcity society" but only if it is transformed into a revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat. Although Posada has expressed a willingness to work with the monarchy, there is little doubt that like the anarchists, her calls to revolution are very literal.\n\nWhile these groups are currently fairly small, their membership is rapidly growing, and news has reached us that they are planning a conference to debate their ideas and form a coalition of some kind, presumably organized around whichever faction's ideas prove most persuasive."

His three-month solo tour of the world has been the talk of Hippogriffia, with many wondering what he'd discover beyond the borders of the island. His words to a reporter from Aris Post have been reprinted in numerous outlets, and his celebrity has turned them into a rallying cry for the isolationist elements within Hippogriffia:\n\n"There are many great sights in the wider world, Karthin chief among them, but I must say on the whole, the Storm King's barbarism is the rule rather than the exception outside of our fair nation. They have very little to offer us except for endless 'isms': communism, liberalism, republicanism, all ideas which griffons and even ponies kill each other over every day.

Director Bon Bon is entusiastic about this plan, saying that it is just as important to protect harmony in Hippogriffia as it is in Equestria, but Princess Twilight Sparkle has expressed some reservations.

However good the intentions behind it, the AHAC's activities undermine that trust. Therefore, [EQS.GetLeader] has regretfully declined your request to share intelligence between SMILE and the Anti-Harmonic Activities Committee."\n\nThis comes as a great disappointment to the AHAC, whose chairgriff expected our friends in Equestria to enthusiastically support our fight against extremism in Hippogriffia."

His voice is joined by the usual choir of progressive harmonists who oppose the AHAC, with Silverstream and Skystar both urging Queen Novo to rein in the AHAC, seeing the ban as yet another example of an escalating trend of xenophobia within the committee, with Skystar being particularly passionate about not wanting to go back to the lonely days of hiding from the world."

 hippogriff.106.desc:0 ""And what's this room for?"\n"That's the outgoing records room, it's where we put files which are going to be sent to the national archive to be prepared for long-term storage."\n"That is so cool!"\n\nSilverstream's tour of the National Revenue Agency's headquarters building had taken nearly four hours, and her guide Swift Claw was wondering when she'd ever stop asking these questions. Swift Claw had been glad to answer at first, enthusiastic even, but as time wore on it became clear Silverstream would never stop asking. It reminded him of his three year old daughter. Swift Claw had become increasingly convinced that the new "Royal Friendship Advisor" was as useless as she was annoying.\n\nAs her tour finally concluded and Swift Claw bade her farewell, Silverstream announced that she'd thought of at least three changes which could be made to "make the whole place more friendly," and said they'd be hearing from her soon. Getting back to his coworkers for coffee, Swift Claw was surprised to hear them all talking about Silverstream: how friendly she was, how appreciated they felt when she came to them, how her questions made them feel like somegriff actually cared about what they were doing. How they hoped their kids grew up to be as kind and thoughtful as her. When Swift Claw mentioned how she'd said she was going to change their workplace, they all agreed that whatever she suggested would definitely make things better. Swift Claw returned home that night a little puzzled, but curiously optimistic. He gave his daughter an extra hug that night, and went to work the next day with a smile on his face."

When Silverstream had suggested Skystar invite her to a party, Skystar had laughed out loud, but Silverstream was serious. One week and a whole lot of awkward conversations later, Silverstream had convinced the communist leader to meet them at a popular club in Seaquestria.\n\n"So that's why cap'talism will alwaysh collapse," slurred the red seapony, several hours into the night, "It's all about the falling rate of profit, it'll happen, don't you worry 'bout it..."\nThe three had all had a little too much, and Skystar wasn't quite sure how long they'd even been there.\n"M'kay so you... you're still gonna fight cuz you think you can't lose? You're crazy Posada..."\n"I am! But naw, communism will win, maybe now, maybe in a thousand yearsh... you guys ain't so bad though is what I mean, you know capitalism will go bye-bye but s'long as it's no Storm King takin' out the whole world with it we good, we good..."\nIn the drunken haze, Posada's words almost made sense, and Skystar felt oddly enraptured as Posada careened into another rapturous rambling declaration about the wonders of nuclear power.\n\n"Is gonna be a nuclear age, I'm tellin' ya!" she proclaimed at the end of it, "Everyfin's gonna be powered by splitting atoms, I'm tellin' ya, I'm tellin' ya... No but really, you's'all've been good to th'left n' me, better'n any other monarchs I can think of... And I know nopony's gonna follow me into some crazy revolutionary thingamabob 'gainst creatures who've done right by them so you have my... My nuclear approval!"\n\nAs Silverstream launched into her third barrage of questions about nuclear science and extraterrestrials, Skystar had a hazy thought that they'd done something good today, no matter how bad the hangover would be tomorrow. They'd spent so long worried this communist was coming for their heads, but now that they finally met her she was just another dorky, enthusiastic seapony like Skystar herself. As she took another long gulp of her seaweed beer, Skystar couldn't help but look forward to working with Posada."

While before, much of the opposition to our trade policies have been from nationalists and isolationists among the middle classes afraid of foreign competition, now much of the anger is coming from the proletariat, as socialist ideas once popular mainly among radical student groups have started percolating among the common workers.

Skystar has suggested getting all the labour leaders together into one room so they can talk amongst themselves and talk with us to figure out a plan that works for everygriff, while auto industry leaders like Lucky Break have cautioned against such a plan, saying that that would likely result in the most radical voices swaying the others and pointing to the increasing popularity of socialist ideologues like the anarchists and Posada. They suggest simply waiting the strikers out, playing the disparate factions off eachother until their movement loses momentum. If that fails, the queen can always sign back-to-work legislation forcing the strikers to return to their jobs."

Novo snapped, "They want to get rid of us. Stallionists, anarchists, Posadists, these new unions are full of them! You know what they do to creatures like us in Stalliongrad? I should have done this a long time ago, but I'm still the Queen. I'm going to ban these unions while I still can."\n\nSkystar was silent for a moment, lost in thought. Novo hadn't heard Skystar be silent in a long time, and finally embraced her daughter in her fins, holding onto her.\n"I'm sorry Skystar. I really don't want to crack down on our own subjects, but I haven't been this scared since the Storm King. I don't want to lose you."\nSkystar hugged her back, trying to find the words to tell her mother how wrong she was.

Finally, Novo rose from her throne, her face betraying outrage, though whether that was at this hippogriff's situation or at his impertinence, nogriff could say. Silencing the room, she spoke:"

Today, we've taken the first step to making our dreams a reality, and have boldly entered a new era. The revolution has truly begun, here in Hippogriffia! And I am honoured to accept the position of General Secretary, and swear to do my duty to the revolution, to bring about a new world from the ashes of the old. As my first act, I would like to call a vote to rename our country to something that better reflects its true purpose and character.

The names before her, twelve in all, were the worst of the reactionaries: the imperialists. A small group of warmongers who wanted to go out and conquer other nations and crush their creatures over some ridiculous theory of Hippogriff supremacy or a sheer lust for conquest.\n\nPosada's own body bore the scars of imperialism: her time imprisoned on one of the Storm King's airships had taught her to loathe them, and the writings of Caramel Marks had given her words to express that revulsion. These twelve had wanted to use their positions in the military and government to make Hippogriffia as vile as the Storm King. Posada had already gotten the Supreme Workers' Council's authorization to deal with them, and there would be no half-measures. Still, they had given her leeway on how exactly to eliminate these twelve: would imprisonment suffice, or would she turn to the bullet?"

Without a word she took a seat in front of Posada's desk, forcing the General Secretary to scurry to her own seat and sit down after her.\n\n"How is the revolution progressing, comrade Posada?" Skystar asked with stiff formality, pouring them each a cup of tea. Posada was flustered, taking a long sip of the mango-flavoured liquid to buy time. While she thought of her response, something cracked in Skystar's expression and she launched into a bubbly series of questions:\n\n"Did I get it right? Cuz like the revolution only started with overthrowing us right, cuz like you need to do so much work to build the new society and all? That's how that works right? We're still in a revolution right?"\n\nPosada spat out her tea. Once she'd finished laughing, she regained some of her composure and answered:\n\n"Well, yes! Yes that's exactly right. No hard feelings about the overthrowing part?"\n\n"Oh, many hard feelings! I was angrier than I've been in... well, ever. But those are in the past, and I've seen what you've been doing. I want to be part of it, if you'll have me."\n\n"Of course we'll have you!" Posada paused, chuckling to herself. "You know, when I was planning the revolution, I never expected I'd end up having a tea party with the princess."\n\n"Wait, did you just make me princess again?"\n\n"N- no, I mean-"\n\n"Well then it's just tea with a comrade, right?""

One of the reasons we don't know what it does is that at even a tenth of the dose I'm about to give you, your blood vessels become... porous. It makes it impossible to administer morphine for the pain. So far, everyone who has suffered an accident bad enough to get to that point... we've granted them euthanasia when they begged us for it. You on the other hand... we don't know how long you'll live after that point, but since your central nervous system will be largely unaffected, quite likely several days. At least."\nThe doors slammed open, and a breathless Skystar rushed in, her eyes bloodshot and watery. "Don't do it, Posada! They might be evil... they might be monsters... they might even deserve it... but lowering yourself to their level would make you a monster too!"\n"The Supreme Workers' Council has voted to leave their fate up to me, Skystar," Posada replied coolly. "And they're going to get what they deserve."\nSkystar dropped to the floor. "Look at them, Posada! They're helpless prisoners. What you're about to do to them is the kind of thing THEY do, not us! Remember about how you spared my family? How you didn't have the capitalists shot? Please, I'm begging you - don't corrupt yourself with torture! Do you want to have that stain on your soul for the rest of your life?"\n"You feel strongly about this?" Posada inquired.\n"More so than anything since Hard Line tried to kill my mother," she whispered. "Please. Just shoot them."\nPosada frowned.

The presidium had been endlessly debating what to do with the Chiropterran occupation zone, with the proposals getting more and more desperate as new facts about the depths of Chiropterra's crimes came to light. This was a society engineered from the ground up for a thousand years to be as ruthless as possible, and they had achieved a level of psychopathic disregard for life normally associated with serial killers across an entire culture. Given the depth of their crimes and the depth of their hatred for their occupiers, incorporating Chiropterra as an ordinary administrative region was out of the question. Whichever option was adopted, it would take generations to fully uproot the Chiropterran system, which had seemingly taken root in the minds of every Chiropterran citizen even with their government gone. Three proposals lay before the presidium, each sickening in its own way.\nThe first would represent a concession to absolute evil. There were two Chiropterran Moonspeakers, two out of the entire country, who had somehow twisted the Nightmarist faith into something resembling liberation theology. Posada could withdraw the majority of the occupation force and put these two in charge, although in order to actually administer Chiropterra they would have to use much of the old power structure, which meant letting war criminals return to their old jobs and potentially setting Chiropterra up to rise again and exact revenge.\nThe second proposal would mean remaining in the Chiropterran quagmire for generations. The creatures of Chiropterra would be mostly spared death, but the Nightmarist faith would be completely banned, even in its most casual incarnations, and the entire population of Chiropterra would be relocated to vast open-air reeducation camps, where the next generation would learn of the evils of the Chiropterran system so that they might grow up better than their parents. This was guaranteed to be met with massive resistance and endless insurgencies, but its proponents argued that the first plan was naive and the third plan monstrous.\nThe third option was little more than genocide. Justice would be applied in its harshest form, with everyone above the rank of sergeant in their vast stratocracy shot. A blue terror of massive proportions would erase Chiropterra, with those who were not shot put into permanent reeducation camps. It was horrific, it was bloodier than even the Storm King's methods, but it would not waste her creatures' lives to save a nation which hated them."

While the methods were monstrous, they advanced medical science years ahead of us, and a group of former Harmonists have persuasively argued that it would be a crime against their victims to burn the information they gathered on Polio, Malaria, and a dozen other diseases which could save so many lives. More controversial are the military applications of their research. While their combat drugs were undeniably effective, many of them were temperamental, and we only have a vague understanding of how they work since so many of their records were destroyed. Adopting these would mean turning our own soldiers into the lab rats of Chiropterra's worst, even from beyond the grave. Still, Terrafin and many others in our own military science division have urged us to put aside these qualms and use these military applications, as doing so would make our troops more effective and almost certainly save lives.\n\nFinally, an even more controversial option has been proposed: Chiropterran scientists advanced medical science immensely, and with the destruction of so many records, much of their data only exists in their heads. Certain technocratic elements have suggested that by offering amnesty to a mere half-dozen of Chiropterra's monsters, we could advance our own medical research dramatically. They would be kept on a tight leash, and obviously we would not let them use their old methods, but there is some appeal to putting these evil minds to work building a better world. Terrafin as well as numerous others have objected to this idea, stating that they do not wish to work with such creatures and that offering them amnesty would sully their entire department."

With added weight from snorkels, fully-sealed armor, and an amphibious engine, anything short of the solid basalt of the ocean floor will be unable to support it, making it rather useless for amphibious assaults. Terrafin has suggested that we take the extensive data from the project and apply it to a more traditional super-heavy tank, as without all the extra weight and complexity he could design a good tank, but some within the project insist that the concept is possible. In particular they point to the double-tread idea which performed well in models but has not been rigorously tested and would take extensive redesigning."

Comrade Posada was thrilled to learn that it also had far greater range underwater than any conventional or magical rifle, and has ordered the rollout of the newly-named 'Caramel-pattern Flechette Rifles' to all branches of our infantry.

While few took the nationalist's word for it, he protested that "Beakolini himself went from being a socialist to being a nationalist, so why can't I do the opposite?"\nEven with his alleged conversion, the former Aris First members who make up these prospective "National Communists" have voiced their opposition to the mainstream RWP's internationalism, arguing that other races and societies are too backwards to achieve communism in a "civilized manner" as we have, and arguing that we owe nothing to such inferior civilizations, and should seek to protect ourselves from them rather than "Pursue some romantic dream of international proletarian solidarity.""

She didn't seem to mind however, and was eagerly jotting notes down in her seashell-themed journal as the members argued. When Hard Line got up to speak, Posada knew there would be trouble.\n\n"Esteemed comrades," he began, "We must address a mistake which I believe this body made during the confusion of the early revolution, but which can be corrected if we act swiftly. We can hardly say that we are sweeping aside the old world if we allow not only capitalists but the royalty themselves to swim among us. We allowed rightist temerity to win out that day, and so I move to reopen the issue of Queen Novo, and suggest we follow what every successful revolution has done and have the primary symbol of reaction in Revolutionary North Zebrica executed immediately."\n\nPosada glanced at Skystar, noticing the young commissar had started to cry even as Hard Line was met with boos and hisses by most of the Workers' Council. Posada had to shut this down at once, and addressed him from across the room:\n\n"Comrades, please! Do not boo him, engage with him. Now, remember Caramel Marks said that it is a sign of weakness of a people to hold their enemy at their mercy and not exact revenge."\n\n"Exactly General Secretary, it was a moment of weakness-"\n\n"Wait!" interrupted Posada, "I am so sorry, esteemed comrades, that wasn't Caramel Marks, that was Beakolini." She heard a tiny giggle coming from Skystar, and continued, launching into a tirade at the momentarily dumbstruck Hard Line: "This body already made its decision, and it was in a moment of courage and clarity, not 'rightist cowardice.' The issue is closed. And the next time you propose murdering Comrade Skystar's mother, I would suggest you do it with more tact or we may have to suspend your membership in the Supreme Workers' Council.""

The message she was greeted with was nothing she had expected.\n\n"My friends," came the voice of the infamous radical Moonspeaker Dusk Wane, "It is time for us to leave our mistakes behind us. I have spoken with the communist leaders, and they have agreed to withdraw their forces and provide amnesty for those still fighting in the hills, so long as we accept our crimes and move forward to build a better Chiropterra."\n\nGuava Drop hissed, but Silver Spike shushed him. She'd always been at least slightly sympathetic to Dusk Wane's message, even if he did border on heresy.\n\n"We have been lost, my friends, for a very long time. I have been to old Tzinacatlia; our true faith is one of sharing, and tolerance of difference. Nightmare Moon shelters all, her light shines upon all, but we have been blinded by grief at our defeat and allowed bitterness to twist us for a thousand years. So I implore you, walk with me, walk with the hippogriffs, into a brighter future free of the poison of hatred."\n\nShe knew she should be outraged at the blatant heresy, but mostly she just felt relieved that the occupation was going to end and Night Eye would be able to come home.

Your husband Night Eye was recently identified in a raid on a terrorist holdout. As you did not come forward with information on him, you are considered an accomplice in his actions, which caused the death of three Blue Army soldiers."\nSilently, Silver Spike congratulated her husband. A fever had prevented her from joining him before the communists had locked down their village, but she was proud of him for making these invaders bleed.\n"Furthermore," the communist continued, "As a second lieutenant in the Ursa Legion, you are considered complicit in the innumerable crimes of Chiropterra, and are therefore scheduled for liquidation."\n\nSilver Spike stiffened. She knew death would come for her, and was ready to face it with dignity. Then she heard Guava Drop whimpering, and glanced behind her to see that her foals had disobeyed her and come out of hiding. All of her strength vanished.\n\n"What about my foals?" she whispered to the hippogriffs, "Will they be taken care of? Will they be alright?"\n"If they behave."\nSilver Spike nodded, and kneeled down to talk to her foals one last time.\n"You be good, okay?" she said, "Agave, you watch after your brother.

They've also argued that competition breeds innovation, and that the exchange of fashion between Hippogriffia and other nations has caused new and exciting fashion trends to develop, which would be stifled by the government issuing bans.

Rather than withdrawing us from Zebrica, Crack Lightning would see us become even more entangled in it in the name of 'Aggressive Defence.' Worse yet, fascism requires one supreme leader, which means he undoubtedly plans to sideline and eliminate both Queen Novo and, well, me."\n\nRaft Wood let his statement sink in, reading the room for a moment. The signs had always been there, but it felt odd to say out loud that his staunchest ally, the charismatic voice which had carried his movement to power, now sought to remove Raft Wood from the picture.\n\n"The hardliners have already started to act. They control the military, the Phalanx, and a significant portion of Aris First. And since we are only now becoming aware of the threat, we have to assume they are several steps ahead of us. We on the other hand have the AHAC, the intelligence agencies, and the police, plus the fact that most of the membership of Aris First and almost all of Hippogriffia at large do not want to live in a fascist state. We will have to act quickly, yet subtly. Prevent him from raising the jingoistic fervour of the masses to a high enough pitch that they demand we go to war, keep an eye on the military for the signs of a coup d'etat, and remove his influence from Aris First. While we're doing that, I will arrgange several secret AHAC meetings to build an ironclad case to arrest him. If we act too brashly, his supporters will hang us in the streets. Too timidly, and he'll have us all shot in a military takeover. This is a fine line we walk, and I don't have to tell you that our full intentions cannot be discussed outside this room. Now, you're dismissed. I trust you all to know what to do when the time comes.""

 arisfirst.14.desc:0 "Popular New Mareland fashion designer Suri Polomare has come out with a line of clothes based on traditional hippogriff designs, modified to fit the pony body. They were designed in correspondence with hippogriff fashionista Cross Stitch, and have already proven quite popular among New Mareland pegasi and thestrals, who admire the breezy cut and the comfort the designs provide while flying. Ms. Polomare has even said that she's considering designing another line for griffon customers in New Mareland and Wingbardy, as well as a high-fashion version to present at this year's Fashion Week in Manehattan."

 arisfirst.13.desc:0 "Crack Lightning and several other prominent voices within Aris First have spoken out against Suri Polomare and her "collaborator" Cross Stitch, claiming that by redesigning hippogriff fashion for ponies she was wrongfully appropriating hippogriff culture and ingenuity. They also poked several holes in the production process where she had deviated from the traditional methods which had inspired the designs.\n\n"These cheap knockoffs," Lightning Crack declared in a brief interview, "Are as inauthentic as they are tacky. If pegasi want to wear hippogriff clothing, they should get it from hippogriffs, or better yet try designing something half as good themselves."\nWhen asked what the harm was, he replied: "The harm is that these knock-offs are the first experience these creatures have with our culture, and having Polomare market these takes jobs away from our hard-working textile workers."\nMore liberal voices have reacted with astonished confusion, with Cross Stitch defending her and Polomare's work as "An attempt to blend the fashion taste of New Mareland ponies with the stylistic trends of Mt. Aris." She pointed to the enthusiastic reception of the line as evidence that if anything, it was giving ponies a greater appreciation for hippogriff culture and traditions."

Suri Polomare protested that she had worked closely with hippogriff fashionista Cross Stitch, but the hippogriffs seem to have taken offense to Cross Stitch's involvement too.\n\nThe line was quite popular among New Mareland pegasi and thestrals, but while it will not be pulled from stores, Ms. Polomare has declared that due to the controversy, the plans to create a high-fashion version of the line for this year's Manehattan Fashion Week have fallen through."

A Wingbardian-made car from Lucky Break's Auto Dealership suffered a brake malfunction, sending a family of three careening into a telephone pole, leaving no survivors. In the wake of the tragedy, nearly two hundred protestors gathered outside Lucky Break's car dealership, picketing the entrance and refusing to leave even when day turned to night and a rainstorm swept across their hastily-erected camp. Lucky Break was nowhere to be found, but the protestor's leader Raft Wood told reporters that his followers would not leave until Lucky Break promised to stop buying Wingbardian and New Marelander automobiles.\n\n"It's a disgrace!" he exclaimed, "Lucky Break knows we produce perfectly good cars here, and yet she insists on bringing in products from halfway across the world, damaging our economy and putting more and more of these foreign deathtraps on the road. Everygriff knows that the Wingbardian and New Mareland goverenments are subsidizing their companies, everygriff knows they don't play fair. Well we've had enough, and we're not gonna leave until something is done about this!"\n\nWhile the police managed to disperse the protestors after the third day, numerous newspaper editorials have come out supporting them, and with Lucky Break and other industry leaders refusing to answer the protestors' demands, they have turned to the government in hopes of getting a ban on the import of foreign cars."

They have accused us of producing unsafe vehicles, and shut down all imports of our cars. Our cars were quite popular in Hippogriffia, and the sudden loss of that entire market is crippling our auto industry.

Curiously, those most affected by the ban seem most supportive of pursuing further retaliatory actions, blaming the government of [From.GetNameDef] for what Aris First leader Raft Wood has called an unfair response. He and his supporters insist that our cars, unlike those manufactured in [From.GetNameDef], are safe for the road and that our companies compete honestly, and thus that this retaliation is yet another example of foreign countries not playing fair with Hippogriffia."

Noted Aris First leader Raft Wood lead the rally, riling up the seaponies and telling them that foreign powers wanted to exploit them and that the government had failed to stop it. He called upon Queen Novo to "hear the voice of the little seapony!" and protect Seaquestrian industry from foreigners.

Regardless of the government's response, the size and enthusiasm of the rallygoers shows that Aris First's message is reaching many hippogriffs in Canterford, so denouncing them could cause a backlash."

This has been corroborated by spy plane flights that recorded high levels of radiation near the uninhabited isles of Sunset Atoll.\n\nWhile technical details are classified, it appears the weapon used a fission reaction to kick-start a fusion reaction in a shell of tritium and deuterium outside it, creating a blast in the megaton range.

 ### LEADERS #####
 HIP_POSADA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 14th of May, 980 in Seaquestria.\n\n§YBiography§!: For most of her childhood, Posada was ostracised by her peers. But she liked it that way, it left her more time to explore and play with her imaginary friends. She became an apprentice bookmaker in her teenaged years and later joined her local finball team eventually representing her hometown at the Pan-Seaquestrian Finball Cup. When she first went to the surface, she looked upon the stars in wonder and often would spend a lot of her time sitting on clouds at night stargazing. It was on one such night she accidently drifted over towards Zebrican territory and was captured by the Storm King's forces.\n\nPosada was chained inside the cargo hold of an airship full of looted trophies and treasures from Colthage. During the long journey she suffered at the hands of her yeti captors, but one night she was able to break free of her shackles. Sneaking through the ship's hold, she was seeking to make a quick escape and then follow the stars home when a flash of green light caught her attention.\n\nThe light ebbed from out the crack in the lid of a large golden chest intricately carved with images of horned beasts and bowing goats. Unable to help herself, she broke the chains and opened the lid. What she saw would change her forever. Images flashed before her eyes. Images of things nogriff should ever know. Images of conflict, strife, poverty and the stars, so many stars. She saw galaxies at the scale of atoms. She saw the raw power of the stars. And more, much more, she could not understand.\n\nIt is unknown how she returned to Hippogriffia. Her mind was broken, and it was months before she could talk in coherent sentences again. Shortly after the Storm King's defeat, a copy of the works of Caramel Marks crossed her desk at work. She found the book as a symbol that she was destined to rediscover what the chest had shown her and to free everycreature from the shackles of capitalism and monarchy. She founded the Revolutionary Workers' Party and quickly started preaching her ideology to every hippogriff and seapony she could.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Neither"
