 ### FOCUS ###
 HIP_focus_tree:0 "Hippogriffia Focus Tree"

 ### NAVY FOCUSES
 HIP_continue_navy_modernisation:0 "Continue Navy Modernisation"
 HIP_continue_navy_modernisation_desc:0 "Although our navy is already one of the most powerful in the world, we cannot afford to be lax. We must ensure our navy is always ahead of the competition. As an island nation, the navy will determine whether we live or die."

 HIP_deep_blue_war_games:0 "Deep Blue War Games"
 HIP_deep_blue_war_games_desc:0 "A strong naval doctrine is essential to success. Traditionally we have favoured striking our enemies' ships when they are in ports, but we do have other doctrinal options available should we wish to change our course. No matter what, we must choose a path."

 HIP_expand_the_marine_corps:0 "Expand the Marines"
 HIP_expand_the_marine_corps_desc:0 "When we must invade other countries, it will be the marines who will lead the way, and the landing craft that will carry them to safety. Naval invasions are a nightmare, but with grit and determination we can prevail."

 HIP_freedom_ships:0 "Freedom Ships"
 HIP_freedom_ships_desc:0 "Our civilian shipping industry is invaluable to our continued development. By producing more convoys, we'll be able to trade with our friends regardless of enemy raiding. As an added bonus, readily available convoys will make naval invasions faster."

 HIP_naval_radar:0 "Shipboard Radar"
 HIP_naval_radar_desc:0 "Radar will let us spot enemy ships through the worst conditions nature can throw at us. Future models may even be able to locate submarines or calculate better firing trajectories."

 HIP_royal_shipbuilding_committee:0 "Form the Royal Shipbuilding Committee"
 HIP_royal_shipbuilding_committee_desc:0 "Our many shipbuilders are skilled but disorganized. Different styles, gun measurements, and even engine designs prevail across the country. By forming a committee to centralise administrations and establish national standards, we can drastically speed up production."

 HIP_seapony_squardrens:0 "Seapony Squadrons"
 HIP_seapony_squardrens_desc:0 "We have a long and storied history of the use of submarines. By forming dedicated squadrons of seaponies to crew them, we can quickly adapt to looming problems with design."

 HIP_underwater_supremacy:0 "Underwater Supremacy"
 HIP_underwater_supremacy_desc:0 "As a nation of seaponies, we can afford to invest even further in submarines. As our submarines don't have to carry air, we can hide like ghosts. Our submarines will strike at any troop transports and escape into the depths. No one will ever be able to take our home from us again!"

 HIP_expand_the_escort_fleet:0 "Expand the Escort Fleet"
 HIP_expand_the_escort_fleet_desc:0 "When trading with other nations, it's absolutely critical to make sure our shipments arrive safely.

 HIP_battleship_primacy:0 "Battleship Primacy"
 HIP_battleship_primacy_desc:0 "The battleship is the ultimate expression of naval dominance, and the backbone of the navy. With a large enough battlefleet, no one will ever dare to attack us."

 HIP_imperious_class:0 "The Imperious Class Project"
 HIP_imperious_class_desc:0 "Our naval theorists have discussed a design for a new battleship. This proposed "super heavy battleship" will carry guns twenty-one meters long. It will no doubt be an enormous investment of resources, but when completed it will tear even the battleships of the future to shreds."

 HIP_air_sea_warfare:0 "Air-Sea Warfare"
 HIP_air_sea_warfare_desc:0 "As a people who can shift from soaring through the skies to swimming under the seas, it's only logical to focus our efforts on a navy that does the same. Pairing planes with boats will not only be a symbol of our unity, it will let us strike our enemies in their bases with ease!"

 HIP_rapid_strike_tactics:0 "Rapid Strike Tactics"
 HIP_rapid_strike_tactics_desc:0 "Our pilots will have to fly in quickly, execute their mission, and then return to the carrier to fuel up. We can accelerate this process by refuelling and reequipping in the air."

 HIP_naval_aeronautics_committee:0 "Naval Aeronautics Committee"
 HIP_naval_aeronautics_committee_desc:0 "With our new focus on carriers, we will also need to modernize our carrier planes. Forming a Naval Aeronautics Committee will help us move boldly into the future and strike any navy that dares oppose us."

 ### INDUSTRY FOCUSES
 HIP_seapony_primacy:0 "Seapony Primacy"
 HIP_seapony_primacy_desc:0 "We survived the Storm King's invasion by hiding underwater. The sea shelters us, and it must be the sea we rely upon going forward. Even with modern submarines, our enemies can't reach the sea floor, so we'll always have a safe place to flee to."

 HIP_hippogriff_primacy:0 "Hippogriff Primacy"
 HIP_hippogriff_primacy_desc:0 "We can't afford to cower in the depths any longer. The world is changing, and if we are to take our place as a preeminent nation among the peoples of the world, it's time to change too."

 HIP_expand_the_underwater_dockyards:0 "Expand the Underwater Dockyards"
 HIP_expand_the_underwater_dockyards_desc:0 "The underwater dockyards allow us to produce and repair ships away from our enemies. With a navy being repaired safe from all harm, we will be able to enjoy true naval supremacy, striking our enemies in port while our own ports are underwater."

 HIP_underwater_construction:0 "Underwater Construction"
 HIP_underwater_construction_desc:0 "Constructing buildings underwater makes them immune to strategic bombing. As long as Seaquestria stands with us, we will have an impervious industry."
 
 HIP_shell_oil:0 "Shell Oil Company"
 HIP_shell_oil_desc:0 "Although we have a reasonable amount of crude oil, it isn't enough to fuel our massive navy. We'll need to develop our oil refining process, and synthetic refineries are also worth looking into."
 
 HIP_support_the_oil_industry:0 "Support the Oil Industry"
 HIP_support_the_oil_industry_desc:0 "There's only so far we can get with improving refining. A great wealth of oil lies under the ocean floor, and we can tap into it with modern extraction. Synthetic oil has also been developed by some other countries of the world, and would help us supplant our natural reserves."

 HIP_national_road_network:0 "National Road Network"
 HIP_national_road_network_desc:0 "By constructing a nationwide road network, we can speed up all our future construction. It'll also be useful for supplying any military operations. It will move our society in favor of hippogriffs, however."

 HIP_underwater_railways:0 "Underwater Railways"
 HIP_underwater_railways_desc:0 "Building underwater rails will make future underwater construction much faster, and even help us build things on the surface should we desire to. It will move our society in favor of seaponies, however."

 HIP_public_infrastructure_works:0 "Public Infrastructure Works"
 HIP_public_infrastructure_works_desc:0 "We are a peaceful and isolationist people. It's only sensible to build better roads and bridges to improve our citizens' quality of life."

 HIP_air_industry_fund:0 "Expand Aircraft Funds"
 HIP_air_industry_fund_desc:0 "We need more fighters. They shoot down enemy bombers and escort ours to their destination. [HIP.GetLeader] has approved a special fund for fighters, using some of the royal treasury to personally cover costs."

 HIP_department_of_commerce:0 "Form the Department of Commerce"
 HIP_department_of_commerce_desc:0 "While we are a modern nation, the fact remains that as the world changes at breakneck speed, we run the risk of being left behind. If we are to safeguard our technological advantage, we need to keep advancing."

 HIP_office_of_industral_sciences:0 "Open the Office of Industrial Sciences"
 HIP_office_of_industral_sciences_desc:0 "There are so many topics we can be investigating, from machinery to electronics to battleships to our own biology. We need to open a new branch of the government dedicated exclusively to research and innovation. This Office of Industrial Sciences will ensure we are never behind our peers."

 HIP_grand_alaudia_bauxite_mine:0 "Mine Bauxite in Alaudia"
 HIP_grand_alaudia_bauxite_mine_desc:0 "Airplanes require aluminium, and our armed forces require a mighty airforce. Our geologists have reported there are massive piles of aluminium in Alaudia. Although it will take time and effort, the rewards will be immense."

 HIP_develop_starfield_steelworks:0 "Develop Starfield Steelworks"
 HIP_develop_starfield_steelworks_desc:0 "Nearly everything we produce needs steel, from shovels to battleships. Starfield is the center of our refining of iron ore into steel, so it's only logical to expand production there."

 HIP_defence_department_desc:0 "In a world filled with threats, we will need a strong army to safeguard our borders. This Department will both cover our army's modernisation and its central administration."

 HIP_modern_weapon_contests:0 "Modern Weaponry Contests"
 HIP_modern_weapon_contests_desc:0 "By holding contests for the best-designed guns and grenades, we can ensure top-of-the-line performance for all our troops. Soldiers are in short supply, so our guns have to be the best we can possibly make them."

 HIP_army_armament_bonds:0 "Armanent Bonds"
 HIP_army_armament_bonds_desc:0 "Selling bonds will help us raise the money to build weapons factories. In the event we're attacked, it'll also let us quickly liquidate our funds to shift civilian factories to military ones."

 HIP_continue_army_modernisation:0 "Continue Army Modernisation"
 HIP_continue_army_modernisation_desc:0 "As a small nation, we have always believed that our first and foremost priority for the army should be better guns than our foes. Some military theorists advocate for changing our course, while others say that what has served us well should remain. Either way, keeping our theory of war modern is absolutely critical in these times."

 HIP_fund_royal_island:0 "Fund the Royal Island Gunworks"
 HIP_fund_royal_island_desc:0 "We have long used cannons in our armies. Big guns let us blast our enemies from afar, keeping our own troops safe. Having Royal Island design new artillery will let us prepare for whatever our enemies throw at us!"

 HIP_army_motorisation:0 "Motorising the Army"
 HIP_army_motorisation_desc:0 "Any attacks on our soil will have to be quickly repulsed, and any terrorist action countered swiftly. Armored cars and mechanized troop transports will keep our soldiers safe as they go wherever they are needed."

 HIP_armor_training_school:0 "Armored Operations Training"
 HIP_armor_training_school_desc:0 "Tanks can punch through lines and quickly encircle enemies. Even if we choose to avoid aggression, tank destroyers are very useful for stopping our enemies' armored advances."

 HIP_royal_engineers_corps_desc:0 "Combat engineers can dig trenches, set explosives to breach forts, and operate flamethrowers to smoke our foes out. We must not neglect our engineers, especialyl the defenses they can give to protect our home."

 HIP_signle_and_logistics_school:0 "A School for Signals and Logistics"
 HIP_signle_and_logistics_school_desc:0 "Modern warfare involves more than guns and planes; it also involves distribution of goods and quick communication. Creating a school dedicated to these less visible but still vital topics will make sure we can synchronize and plan with lightning speed."

 HIP_invite_griffon_officers:0 "Invite Griffon Theorists"
 HIP_invite_griffon_officers_desc:0 "The Griffonian school of war has long been that maximal planning and preparation is the method by which victory is won. We can approach them for guidance on our own war machine to help us organize properly."

 HIP_lessons_from_the_enemy:0 "Lessons from the Enemy"
 HIP_lessons_from_the_enemy_desc:0 "The Storm King's tactics were brutal yet effective. Rapidly organized plans and swift offensives let him conquer most of Zebrica, and doing the same could let us take the fight to any would-be conquerors."

 HIP_grand_alaudia_training_grounds:0 "Training Grounds at Grand Alaudia"
 HIP_grand_alaudia_training_grounds_desc:0 "Grand Alaudia has both jungles and plains, and it's respectably distant from Mount Aris. Summoning our entire army there to practice war games, and then conducting extensive surveys on the experience of both foot soldiers and generals, will help us reorganize our army and refine our military doctrine."

 HIP_air_to_ground_warfare:0 "Air-to-Ground Warfare"
 HIP_air_to_ground_warfare_desc:0 "Paratroopers can land behind enemy lines and quickly disrupt their flow of supply. If we can capture their capitals and industrial centers, we might be able to win wars without ever firing a shot."

 HIP_special_service_force:0 "Special Forces Concentration"
 HIP_special_service_force_desc:0 "Special forces, from mountaineers to paratroopers to even more exotic possibilities like amphibious tanks, are a defining part of the [HIP.GetAdjective] military. We'll need to train more to cover our various operations and maximize the impact of our limited soldiers."

 HIP_jungle_special_forces_school:0 "Jungle Special Forces School"
 HIP_jungle_special_forces_school_desc:0 "Jungles are a nightmare to fight on for everyone. However, we have many jungles across our lands, and by training troops in jungle warfare, we can give our special forces a deadly edge in this dangerous terrain."

 HIP_mountain_warfare_school:0 "Mountain Warfare School"
 HIP_mountain_warfare_school_desc:0 "Mountaineers are a necessity on on any mountain terrain, and as our capital lies atop a great mountain, we'll need to invest heavily to protect it. Mountaineers can make the ost of our home, securing it against any attack."

 HIP_national_defence_draft:0 "National Defence Draft"
 HIP_national_defence_draft_desc:0 "In these terrifying times, we have to take drastic measures. [HIP.GetLeader] has, after extensive deliberation, decided to institute a limited draft. This decision is not taken lightly, but we must ensure the safety of all seaponies and hippogriffs. [HIP.GetName] will never flee again!"

 HIP_royal_legion_of_aris:0 "The Royal Legion of Aris"
 HIP_royal_legion_of_aris_desc:0 "We love peace, but in a violent world, sometimes the only way to preserve peace is to fight. The Royal Legion of Aris will preserve our rights and protect our home against anyone who would take it from us."

 HIP_air_armament_committee_desc:0 "As the world recovers from the Storm King's defeat, it's more important than ever to make sure we have a strong air force to keep our people safe. Whether that's fighters to protect our own airspace, or bombers to take out the enemy's ability to wage war, we have to be ready for whatever the world throws at us."

 HIP_air_land_warfare_focus:0 "Air-Land Warfare"
 HIP_air_land_warfare_focus_desc:0 "Any war must ultimately be won on land. By focusing our air force around winning land battles, we can push our enemies back whenever they advance, securing our borders forever."

 HIP_tactical_bombing:0 "Tactical Bomber Initiative"
 HIP_tactical_bombing_desc:0 "While we favor close air support to win land battles, tactical bombers are a necessity to cover other operations. They can execute any mission with reasonable effectiveness, from strategic bombing to close air support, and are thus wonderfully flexible."

 HIP_escort_fighters:0 "Escort Fighters"
 HIP_escort_fighters_desc:0 "Our bombers will need protection. Whether strategic bombers deep in enemy territory or CAS striking our straits, heavy fighters can reach across vast distances and defend bombers from local planes."

 HIP_consolidated_aircraft_focus:0 "Consolidated Aircraft"
 HIP_consolidated_aircraft_focus_desc:0 "An airforce built for immense range will let us fight our opponents across the continents. The Consolidated Aircraft company has already offered to aid us in our development."

 HIP_fighter_working_group:0 "Fighter Working Group"
 HIP_fighter_working_group_desc:0 "Enemy bombers will inevitably target our homes and factories. We swam underwater to escape the Storm King's armies, but as much of our industry is on land, doing so is immensely costly. Building fighters will let us engage bombers before they strike our land."

 HIP_young_flyers_programme:0 "Young Fliers Program"
 HIP_young_flyers_programme_desc:0 "Are you doing your part? Our air force is the shield against our foes' bombs and the spear we ready against their charges. If we make this clear to our people, we're bound to have many young hippogriffs flocking to the air force!"

 HIP_academy_of_air_sciences:0 "Academy of Aerial Science"
 HIP_academy_of_air_sciences_desc:0 "With new plane models rolling off the assembly lines, we ought to found a new academy dedicated to the theory of air warfare. We'll likely be able to research other, more esoteric technologies as well..."

 HIP_jet_engine_development_desc:0 "The jet engine has the potential to completely revoluntionize flight. With it, we might even be able to break the sound barrier. We can't afford to neglect this promising new field of study!"

 HIP_rocketry_school:0 "Department of Rocketry"
 HIP_rocketry_school_desc:0 "Rockets—self-propelled missiles packed with liquid or solid fuel—have the potential to strike a base in the [CHN.GetName] from the comfort of our own mountain. A way to wage war without a single hippogriff or seapony ever having to leave home is incredibly tempting for obvious reasons. We need to find out more!"

 HIP_atom_committee:0 "Atomic Committee"
 HIP_atom_committee_desc:0 "Our scientists have long known that matter is made up of atoms. Recent findings suggest that certain atoms, in particular uranium and plutonium, can be split, and that such an event, properly controlled, could cause a chain reaction, unleashing incalculable destruction and loss of civilian life. We don't want to kill innocents, of course, but even having such a weapon could prove a mighty deterrant. In the long run, this weapon could aid the cause of peace."

 HIP_strategic_obliteration_doctraine:0 "Strategic Obliteration Doctrine"
 HIP_strategic_obliteration_doctraine_desc:0 "Victory in war can only be achieved by the total obliteration of our enemy's capability to wage war.

 HIP_bomber_offensive:0 "Bomber Offensive"
 HIP_bomber_offensive_desc:0 "The total destruction of the enemy's capability to wage war can only be achieved by increasing the size of our bomber fleet. More bombers means more bombs, and more bombs means fewer guns for the enemy."

 HIP_plecate_the_isolationists_desc:0 "The isolationist policies have long been championed by the seaponies, who view recent events as evidence that we should stick with isolationism instead of opening up. If we are to make progress, we have to make sure that they are placated."

 HIP_self_efficency:0 "Seapony Autarky"
 HIP_self_efficency_desc:0 "Hippogriffia survived for centuries on its own, and it would be beyond irresponsible to abandon this policy. Between invaders, slavers, mad foreigners and countless other threats, we must make sure to rally all the strength we possess for the benefit of our nation, not others'."

 HIP_anti_harmonic_activities_committee:0 "The Anti-Harmonic Activities Committee"
 HIP_anti_harmonic_activities_committee_desc:0 "Stalliongrad, Chiropterra, Griffonia, the Stormlanders: foreign ideologies and interests can be found everywhere, and many of these are driven by interests directly opposed to ours.

 HIP_committie_for_national_defence:0 "The Comittee for National Defense"
 HIP_committie_for_national_defence_desc:0 "War will come to our nation's borders once again, whether sooner or later.

 HIP_expand_the_royal_acadamy:0 "Universal Education"

 HIP_long_distance_friendship:0 "Long Distance Friendship"
 HIP_long_distance_friendship_desc:0 "We want to be self-reliant, but that does not mean that we are going to forget the friends we do have. Those who give kindness can be given it in return, and we will both be stronger for it."

 HIP_leand_lease:0 "Lend-Lease"
 HIP_leand_lease_desc:0 "Even if we cannot directly aid our friends in war, we can still make sure they are given the tools needed to finish the job. Our factories stand ready to churn out countless weapons needed, and our friends will have access to it for the lowest price we can charge."

 HIP_the_mountain_awakes:0 "The Mountain Awakes"
 HIP_the_mountain_awakes_desc:0 "We were asleep, but now we have awaken. The mountain is no longer silent, but it resonates with the sound of labour and preperations. Beware, all who would threaten us. We are ready for you, and we will be your undoing."

 HIP_traditional_studdies:0 "Never Forget Our Roots"
 HIP_traditional_studdies_desc:0 "We cannot, must not, forget who we are. To ensure this, our children will receieve a throrough education in our history and traditions, and all who wish to work towards its preservation and continuation will be given support in their endevours."

 HIP_expand_costal_fortifications:0 "Expand Coastal fortifications"
 HIP_expand_costal_fortifications_desc:0 "Anycreature who sets a single hoof or claw on our islands will be met with resistance from the get-go. If they establish a beachhead, it might already be too late, so we must make sure they will never be able to."

 HIP_youth_defence_league:0 "The Youth Defense League"
 HIP_youth_defence_league_desc:0 "We would never place our children in harms way, but in war there are many duties necessary, including several that will keep them able to aid in the struggle, but still remain out of the way of the actual fighting."

 HIP_never_to_fall_again:0 "As the War Approaches"
 HIP_never_to_fall_again_desc:0 "When the Storm King came, we could have lost everything. The next time war comes - and it will come sooner or later - we shall be ready to meet it with all the strength we have."

 HIP_trade_ports:0 "Designated Trade Ports"
 HIP_trade_ports_desc:0 "Contrary to what some claim, we are not looking to stick our heads in the sand and ignore the outside world. The cities of Winggarden, Howlington, and Canterford will be dedicated to trade with the outside world, and through it we can still be part of the world while watching its influence on us."

 HIP_agricultral_reforms:0 "Agricultural Reforms"
 HIP_agricultral_reforms_desc:0 "The agricultural sector has been left languishing in recent times. With all the development both internally and abroad, the time has come for a dedicated effort to make sure that our farmers can keep feeding our people even if the worst happens."

 HIP_encourage_private_enterprise:0 "Encourage Private Enterprises"
 HIP_encourage_private_enterprise_desc:0 "As our nation grows, so will its industry, but it'd only bloat the nation to try to run everything centrally.

 HIP_develop_our_outer_islands:0 "Developing the Outer Islands"
 HIP_develop_our_outer_islands_desc:0 "Mount Aris is the gleaming jewel of Hippogriffia, but a jewel needs a necklace to hold it. Too long, we have ignored the golden ring of islands around us, and this must be rectified."

 HIP_encourage_tourism:0 "Come on Down to Hippogriffia!"
 HIP_encourage_tourism_desc:0 "Our home is among the most beautiful regions in the world, and visitors agree. Opening up for tourist enterprises will net us another source of revenue, as well as making sure that thousands of creatures across the world will go home with positive experiences of us."

 HIP_cut_industral_red_tape:0 "Cut the Industrial Red Tape"
 HIP_cut_industral_red_tape_desc:0 "Our industry suffers from miles upon miles of red tape. It might have been well-intentioned, but it is simply stifling us. Rationalizing the bureaucracy, doing away with some of the regulatory framework and consolidating the management of the remainder into a new organization will benefit our economy immensely."

 HIP_encourage_the_automotive_industry:0 "Encourage the Automotive Industry"
 HIP_encourage_the_automotive_industry_desc:0 "The car did have some difficulties getting established in Hippogriffia, being neither able to fly nor swim, but over time more and more of us have come to enjoy both as a tool and as entertainment.

 HIP_organise_the_leftist_movements:0 "Organize the Left"
 HIP_organise_the_leftist_movements_desc:0 "The Left is a disparate group of young socialists, anarchist thinkers, and Posada's radical Revolutionary Workers' Party.

 HIP_hippogriffias_own_path_to_socialism:0 "Hippogriffia's Own Path to Communism"
 HIP_hippogriffias_own_path_to_socialism_desc:0 "Anarchism is an old tradition in Hippogriffia, so why should we turn the ideas of a madfish when we have something perfectly serviceable right here? Power will be devolved and the state abolished."
 HIP_import_the_revolution:0 "The Marksist Revolution"
 HIP_import_the_revolution_desc:0 "A stateless society is a desirable end, to be sure, but to get there will take a transitional dictatorship of the proletariat. It is absolutely essential that at this vulnerable time we not falter. Stalliongrad may have made some errors, but that simply means we must do better this time. After all, isn't dialectics the essence of communism?"
 HIP_the_triumphant_revolution:0 "The Revolution Triumphant"
 HIP_the_triumphant_revolution_desc:0 "Against all the wealth of the capitalists and cruelty of the imperialists, we prevailed. Now Hippogriffia stands ready to begin exporting the revolution globally, as it was always meant to be. To the workers of the world!"
 HIP_reorganise_the_armed_forces:0 "The Blue Military"
 HIP_reorganise_the_armed_forces_desc:0 "Reactionary and monarchist thinking are disappointingly common among our air force, navy, and army.

We die for more than Hippogriffia now; we die for every oppressed creature everywhere!"
 HIP_peoples_liberation_army:0 "The Revolutionary Army"
 HIP_peoples_liberation_army_desc:0 "The army takes, the army holds, and ultimately the army plants the flag atop the capital. Our soldiers must be more than well equipped and well trained; they must believe, to the core of their being, that it is their service and sacrifice that will save the cause of international communism."
 HIP_committee_of_global_liberation:0 "The Committee of Global Liberation"
 HIP_committee_of_global_liberation_desc:0 "To have a revolution in one nation and not export it is the height of folly. We cannot abide injustice anywhere, and therefore we must begin preparing to bring our revolution to all peoples of the world. As a first step, we will establish a trained volunteer corps capable of fighting in any conflict at any time."
 HIP_no_step_back:0 "Not One Inch"

 HIP_experimental_weaponry:0 "Experimental Weaponry Development"
 HIP_experimental_weaponry_desc:0 "The wars of the future will be fought with chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and magical (CBRNM) weaponry. We must begin training our troops in how best to counter such horrible weapons, and how to fight when the battlefield itself wants them dead. This will naturally require properly understanding such weapons ourselves."
 HIP_modern_revolutionary_theory:0 "Modern Revolutionary Theory"
 HIP_modern_revolutionary_theory_desc:0 "It is not sufficient to merely have a talented, adept armed forces; we must have the knowledge and skill to properly employ them. Every aspect of military doctrine shall be examined for flaws and potential improvements, and the results shall be forwarded to the military high command. There is always room for thesis and antithesis to form a synthesis!"
 HIP_peoples_liberation_air_force:0 "The Revolutionary Air Force"
 HIP_peoples_liberation_air_force_desc:0 "Our pilots, whether shooting down enemy bombers come to destroy our homes, or dropping payloads on enemy soldiers, are the aerial vanguard of the revolution."
 HIP_destory_the_methods_of_war:0 "Destroy the Methods of War"
 HIP_destory_the_methods_of_war_desc:0 "War is a horrific affair, and nowhere is that more evident than the horrors brought with strategic bombing. Carpet bombing, napalm, and worse coat whole cities. Such suffering is incalculable, and it is doubly awful how many could have been our comrades. Nonetheless, we must engage in this dirty practice ourselves. Every bullet stopped from reaching the frontline is a comrade saved."
 HIP_spread_the_revolution_north:0 "Free the Peoples of the North"
 HIP_spread_the_revolution_north_desc:0 "[ROOT.GetName] is more than just a name. It is a symbol of our aspirations. The time has come to liberate our unfortunate comrades, toiling under slavery or capitalism. The vanguard of the revolution shall not abandon its kin!"
 HIP_peoples_liberation_navy:0 "The Revolutionary Navy"
 HIP_peoples_liberation_navy_desc:0 "The navy will let us bring the revolution to any shores anywhere in the world. With every imperialist ship sent fleeing, with every enemy invasion sunk, the flag of communism flies higher. New admirals shall be trained, and our navy shall be geared around the most critical points, both within a ship and within a battle. One sub's good torpedo to a magazine can destroy a battleship."
 HIP_liberation_of_the_high_seas:0 "Victory on the High Seas"
 HIP_liberation_of_the_high_seas_desc:0 "Wars are won on the operational level, not the tactical level. Therefore naval production must be increased, yet we cannot infringe too heavily on civilian life. The only solution is to increase naval output across the board, so as to ensure we can defeat our enemies through sheer numbers."
 HIP_integrate_the_north:0 "Integrate North Zebrica"
 HIP_integrate_the_north_desc:0 "Tobuck, Warzena, Zarantia. These places have all been burdened by capitalism and reaction, but at last we have freed them. Now we must reorganize administration, rule with a kinder fin, and welcome our brothers and sisters into the fold of revolutionary communism!"
 HIP_permanent_revolution:0 "Permanent Revolution"
 HIP_permanent_revolution_desc:0 "The revolution must continue until there is nothing but communism worldwide. We stand ready to assist our comrades anywhere, anytime, with whatever they may need."
 HIP_the_matter_of_class_enemies:0 "The Matter of Class Enemies"
 HIP_the_matter_of_class_enemies_desc:0 "As described in Marks's Capital, the rich are not at fault for being rich; the system simply requires some winners, and they are as much puppets of history as we are. But that does not mean that excessive cruelty is inevitable, nor that it shouldn't be punished. We will attend to each capitalist and reactionary as they deserve, meeting kindness with mercy and wickedness with punishment."
 HIP_redeem_the_monarchy:0 "Spare the Monarchy"
 HIP_redeem_the_monarchy_desc:0 "Unlike many monarchies around the world, the Hippogriffian royal line ruled with kindness and fairness. While we must strip them of their titles in accordance with Marksist theory, we do not need to treat them harshly. We rejoice at the end of an old dynasty, and we welcome our new comrades as equals in the revolutionary workers' state."
 HIP_a_bit_of_poetic_justice:0 "Poetic Justice for the Capitalists"
 HIP_a_bit_of_poetic_justice_desc:0 "While Comrade Posada was tempted with the thought of forcing former CEOs to be paid the wages of the lowest-paid employee within their companies, such ideation is contrary to the goals of the revolution. They will instead be placed with the common workers they once oppressed, to hopefully learn some humility and kindness through honest work."
 HIP_fate_of_the_imperialists:0 "A Solution to the Imperialist Problem"
 HIP_fate_of_the_imperialists_desc:0 "Worse than even fascists are imperialists; those who would conquer and subjugate and pillage and burn simply to satisfy their own hunger for more. Hippogriffia slew one such tyrant a few years ago. The time has come to finish off the rest of them."
 HIP_admiral_skystar:0 "Promote New Admirals"
 HIP_admiral_skystar_desc:0 "We will have the largest and grandest navy in the world, and such a fleet will by nature necessitate many new officers. In particular, Comrade Skystar has shown interest in captaining a vessel..."
 HIP_communists_have_music:0 "The Communists Have the Music"
 HIP_communists_have_music_desc:0 "Culture is a core part of society, and revolutionary culture must be promoted. Every form of art shall be cultivated and brought to light, so that the proletarian can truly enjoy life. Labor songs will be sung throughout the land, murals depicting the might of the worker shall be painted, and all will share in the benefits and joys!"
 HIP_junior_pioneers:0 "The Junior Pioneers"
 HIP_junior_pioneers_desc:0 "The children are the future of the revolution, and it is paramount that they be trained and taught. As communists we follow a process to achieve communism, and it will be the children raised in a dictatorship of the proletariat who will finally lead us there. They are not merely pioneers of their peers; they are pioneers of the future for us all."
 HIP_praxis_backed_by_theory:0 "Praxis Backed by Theory"
 HIP_praxis_backed_by_theory_desc:0 "Theory without praxis is navel-gazing, and praxis without theory is chaos. Only together can communism be achieved, and so together we shall forge the future. Everyone in the nation will receive a full education, going as far as they desire. Be it technical, academic, or martial, no one shall be untaught!"
 HIP_centeral_committee_of_national_administration:0 "The Central Committee"
 HIP_centeral_committee_of_national_administration_desc:0 "A revolution requires central administration. While some comrades believe it should be limited and small, only anarchists seriously argue for a lack of any centralization. Therefore the Central Committee will be created to ensure activities are controlled and managed on a national level."
 HIP_the_hearts_of_the_griffs:0 "The Hearts of the People"
 HIP_the_hearts_of_the_griffs_desc:0 "False consciousness is a troubling element in every state. Some workers simply do not understand how communism will aid them personally, and believe the capitalist lies that we seek to oppress and hurt them. Therefore we will begin a massive education wave, accompanied by sweeping reforms, to show the people that we are on their side. No proletarian should fear their own dictatorship."
 HIP_raceless_society:0 "Raceless Society"
 HIP_raceless_society_desc:0 "Hippogriff, seapony, zebra, or pony; all are equals in our new communist society. Racism shall be eradicated completely, and those ethnonationalists who would drive a wedge between workers will face the workers' justice!"
 HIP_kickstart_nuclear_program:0 "The Atom Burns Blue"
 HIP_kickstart_nuclear_program_desc:0 "General Secretary Posada has always known that the mighty atom is the hammer with which we shall break the back of capitalism. Our nuclear program must be the most powerful in the world. We shall develop atomic energy that will show the world just how mighty the force of international communism truly is! With weapons such as these, the Storm Kings of the world will cower in terror!"
 HIP_eradicate_poverty:0 "Annihilate Poverty"
 HIP_eradicate_poverty_desc:0 "Every worker, farmer, and soldier deserves a rich, fulfilling life. While many other left-wing states have made efforts to abolish poverty, in most of them the workers did not have the benefit of a truly prosperous economy. Here in Hippogriffia, we are blessed with one of the wealthiest economies in the world, and so we have the capability to reach a 0% poverty rate."
 HIP_seize_private_industires:0 "The Factories of the Future"
 HIP_seize_private_industires_desc:0 "It is absolutely necessary that we continue industrialization and mechanization as intensively as possible. We are surrounded by capitalist vultures eying us hungrily, and to show weakness for an instance risks being devoured. Therefore all private industries shall be seized and nationalized, subject to collectivization as quickly as possible."
 HIP_collectivise_the_farmland:0 "Collective Farms"
 HIP_collectivise_the_farmland_desc:0 "It is insufficient to have the state running all business, for in such a case we have simply created a new form of capitalism--state capitalism! The workers must be placed in charge of their economic production. The easiest place to start will be the seaweed and algae farms, which have always been a hotbed of shared cooperation."
 HIP_share_the_means_of_production:0 "Worker-Owned Means of Production"
 HIP_share_the_means_of_production_desc:0 "Every worker shall own the means of production. The state shall act as administrator when necessary, but all returns shall be directed back into the workers who toil for the good of each other. This, of course, is a temporary arrangement; once our position is secured, we will be able to move beyond the need for a profit-driven economy and into a utility or even gift economy."
 HIP_ensure_luxuary_goods_production:0 "Luxury for All"
 HIP_ensure_luxuary_goods_production_desc:0 "An adequate life is inadequate; good enough is not good enough. Luxury, previously the privilege of the wealthy, can now be the right of all workers. No more shall naysayers claim that communism is the equal sharing of miseries!"
 HIP_standardise_living_conditions:0 "Standardize Living Conditions"
 HIP_standardise_living_conditions_desc:0 "In some allegedly communist states,the party bureaucrats rise to wealth and privilege above their comrades. They live in luxurious palaces painted red, and profit as a new labor aristocracy. That can never happen here. Every party member's salary shall be restricted to that of the least well-off creature in the nation."
 HIP_workers_paradise:0 "A Worker's Paradise"
 HIP_workers_paradise_desc:0 "Healthcare, safe conditions, friendly coworkers, fair hours, and the abolition of the wage system - these are all common demands of the proletariat. As the dictatorship of the proletariat grows in power, we find ourselves in a position to answer these calls. Let us banish want forever!"
 HIP_the_immortal_science_of_dialectical_materialism:0 "The Immortal Science of Dialectical Materialism"
 HIP_the_immortal_science_of_dialectical_materialism_desc:0 "Caramel Marks was a great scholar, and more than that, she was a great pony. But she is dead, and to adhere to her ideas blindly is to adopt a new religion. We must always apply her methods to her own writings, and to every so-called leftist state in the world. Only then can we see true communism begin to emerge."
 HIP_prepare_for_first_strike:0 "War Plan Uranium"
 HIP_prepare_for_first_strike_desc:0 "Colthage and Chiropterra, two evil states. Chiropterra is an insane cult that practicies slavery, sapient experimentation, and worse, and Colthaginian slaver lords profit off the backs of their subjects. We cannot abide the existence of such states any longer. The North will be swept clean of reaction, and the monsters will learn fear!"
 HIP_attack_bat:0 "Crush the Lunatics"
 HIP_attack_bat_desc:0 "Is there a more evil state than Chiropterra anywhere in the world? The Nightmare cultists are rightfully hated by all their neighbors, and the time has come to stamp them out. Workers of Chiropterra, your liberation is at claw!"
 HIP_fate_of_bat:0 "The Fate of Chiropterra"
 HIP_fate_of_bat_desc:0 "The struggle is over, and Chiropterra lies defeated. But now we must determine its future. Shall we release it as a puppet state, under a sympathetic leader? Send the population to be deradicalized? Or shall we pursue justice, and punish the monsters who ran such a system? The decision is up to the General Secretary."
 HIP_fate_high_command:0 "The Fate of the High Command"
 HIP_fate_high_command_desc:0 "The six ponies who ran this monstrous system have only one fate awaiting: death. The only question remaining is how the execution is to be carried out. The guillotine and the firing squad are classics, but there are other options available, should we wish for something more unorthodox..."
 HIP_end_of_chiropterra:0 "The Death of Chiropterra"
 HIP_end_of_chiropterra_desc:0 "Chiropttera is gone. The Nightmarists are subjugated, and the revolution has triumphed over the most evil regime known to creaturekind. It is time to celebrate; a thousand years of planning were defeated by the strength of the workers!"
 HIP_steal_chiropterras_stuff:0 "The Dark Side of the Moon"
 HIP_steal_chiropterras_stuff_desc:0 "The Nightmarists discovered horrifying things in their pursuit of victory at any cost. While we cannot abide such cruel experimentation, we can certainly benefit from their findings and utilize these discoveries against other reactionaries. But it might be better to let these secrets lie buried with their researchers. In the end, Posada has the final say."
 HIP_secrets_of_the_night:0 "Secrets of the Night"
 HIP_secrets_of_the_night_desc:0 "Chiropterra has always been a reclusive, hidden nation. But no longer. We have a modern intelligence agency and we will penetrate their veil of secrecy. We will locate their weak points and strike ruthlessly. Chiropterra will not escape the righteous workers' justice!"
 HIP_exotic_weapons:0 "Form the Exotic Weaponry Commission"
 HIP_exotic_weapons_desc:0 "Shock and awe is a powerful force on the battlefield, and few things can impose it as well as weapons never seen before. Super-heavy tanks, APCs, helicopters, ground effect vehicles, and more will be investigated, and funding devoted to find the most effective methods of application. While this might prove costly in the short run, the long-term benefits of awe-inspiring weaponry will speak for themselves."
 HIP_undersea_reactors:0 "Undersea Reactors"
 HIP_undersea_reactors_desc:0 "Previously deemed too detrimental on the environment, undersea reactors are rapidly proving necessary. It is absolutely vital to the success of the revolution that nuclear production not be inhibited by enemy strategic bombing. A truly unassailable nuclear program will ensure our respect among the capitalist and imperialist nations of the world!"
 HIP_depleted_uranium:0 "Depleted Uranium Applications"
 HIP_depleted_uranium_desc:0 "After nuclear refining is done, we have massive surpluses of depleted uranium left behind. Of little strategic value, such residue may prove valuable at the tactical level. Depleted uranium is of comparable hardness to tungsten or chromium, and will make for excellent armor as well as munitions."
 HIP_expand_crystal_mining:0 "Expand Crystal Extraction"
 HIP_expand_crystal_mining_desc:0 "More reactors require more crystals, and we cannot rely on imports in a world filled with enemies. The crystal mines of Mount Aris must be expanded, and prospecting for crystals in other regions will become essential as we go forward."
 HIP_integrate_cth:0 "Sweep the Remainder"
 HIP_integrate_cth_desc:0 "Macawia has long been a harmonic land, but unfortunately it has proven resistant to communism. Revolutionary North Zebrica must encompass all of North Zebrica to be worthy of the name. Similarly, Quaggati will fall to the revolution. Soon, the blue flag will fly high atop the land!!"
 HIP_attack_cth:0 "Free the Slaves"
 HIP_attack_cth_desc:0 "Colthage has long been a "republic", and yet they still have such awful institutions as slavery. Is this not the ultimate proof of the failure of reactionary democracy? It falls to the international revolution to end the cruelties of the reactionaries, and free our brothers and sisters in Colthage!"
 HIP_harmonic_cooperation:0 "Cooperate with the Harmonists"
 HIP_harmonic_cooperation_desc:0 "Comrade Silverstream leads a minority faction in the party advocating for avoiding excessive brutality or authoritarianism. Should we align with these ideas, we may find relations with Equestria thawing. The fact is that harmony is a vastly less terrible system to live under than supremacy, so why shouldn't we work together to destroy the latter?"
 HIP_democratic_centralism:0 "Democratic Centralism"
 HIP_democratic_centralism_desc:0 "It is only logical to follow Steel Stallion's application and allow for the majority to rule, as they do in bourgeois democracies. As we are a party, however, after the voting is concluded, everycreature must abide willingly by the ruling. This is the best and fairest way to ensure the workers' say is heard, and the reactionaries do not gain undue power over us."
 HIP_one_party_many_wings:0 "One Party with Many Wings"
 HIP_one_party_many_wings_desc:0 "Harmonic socialist, anarchist, communist, and otherwise, all are welcome in our party so long as they abide by the rules. Ideological diversity is vital to the survival of the party, just as genetic diversity is vital to the survival of a species."
 HIP_the_stalliongradian_model:0 "The Stalliongradian Model"
 HIP_the_stlaliongradian_model_desc:0 "Steel Stallion was a visionary and we must abide by his plans. That does not mean we will copy Stalliongrad blindly, however. Troubling elements of factionalism and personality cults have infiltrated the home of the revolution. We must make sure that never happens here. Democratic centralism will be followed completely."
 HIP_councilism:0 "Council Communism"
 HIP_councilism_desc:0 "The basis of communism is the workers' council, something similar to yet distinct from the union under capitalism. Power will be returned to the people at the local level, and confederalism will administrate and guide the nation. The office of General Secretary will become contingent not upon the Supreme Soviet's vote, but upon the consent of a majority of the councils. All power to the workers!"
 HIP_devolve_power_to_councils:0 "Devolve Authority to Workers"
 HIP_devolve_power_to_councils_desc:0 "Why should party bureaucrats hold authority over the people they are meant to serve? It is absolutely vital that the workers themselves hold their fate in their own fins, and so we will put in place safeguards against repression and tyranny. The Supreme Soviet and the office of General Secretary will have powers revoked as a precaution."
 HIP_the_hippogriff_model:0 "The North Zebrican Model"
 HIP_the_hippogriff_model_desc:0 "Steel Stallion was a great pony, but to call yourself a "Stallionist" is to put up a hero to be worshipped instead of another traveler along the same path. We must always improve upon those that have gone before, and Stalliongrad's system fell to infighting and factionalism after Stallion's death. We need to guarantee that will not happen here, and so our own governmental system will be custom-built to preempt the errors that have plagued other communist nations."
 HIP_no_compromise_on_communism:0 "No Compromise on Communism"
 HIP_no_compromise_on_communism_desc:0 "Communism is the real movement that abolishes the current state of things. Harmonists in all honesty want simply to keep the state of things as they are now, perhaps with token reforms. Comrade Silverstream's pleas have been considered and rejected, and we will go forward without the moderates."
 HIP_organic_centralism:0 "Organic Centralism"
 HIP_organic_centralism_desc:0 "The Party is more than merely the vanguard of the revolution, it is the most class-conscious part of the proletariat. Therefore it must be willing to go against the majority of the proletariat, who are still largely infected with false consciousness injected by the capitalists. We must also maximize party memorship, however, and so everycreature will be invited to the party to gain true class consciousness."
 HIP_a_state_built_on_theory:0 "A State Built on Theory"
 HIP_a_state_built_on_theory_desc:0 "The party leadership must consult with every part of the party base and then make a decision in accordance with revolutionary theory. This requires the party base be well-educated and informed. Therefore the theory book clubs will be expanded. Everycreature shall make their voice heard, the party leadership will listen, and then the right course of action will be determined through debate."
 HIP_towards_post_scarcity:0 "Towards Post-Scarcity"
 HIP_towards_post_scarcity_desc:0 "One of the greatest aims of a communist society is to abolish scarcity. While we are not yet in a place to eliminate scarcity of weapons, we can do so for civilian desires, at least in peacetime. This will be a significant drain on our economy, but it will be worth it. Isn't the goal of communism a better life for the worker?"

 HIP_encourage_migration_desc:0 "Ain Trotgourait is a wonderful place to live. Why should we deny our citizens freedom of movement in our own land?

 HIP_wingnot_accords:0 "Revisit the Wingnot Accords"
 HIP_wingnot_accords_desc:0 "Our mandate was only ever meant to be a temporary measure to ensure the security of Hippogriffia and Zumidia. It's time to meet with Zumidian community leaders at their historic Wingnot Palace to work out the future hoof in claw."

 HIP_expand_highwing_mines:0 "Expand the Highwing Mines"

 HIP_ain_tougot:0 "Urbanize Ain Trotgourait"

 HIP_government_representation:0 "Zumidian Representation"

 HIP_self_rule:0 "Institute Self-Rule"
 HIP_self_rule_desc:0 "It only makes sense to restore Zumidia to its own state. The Zumidian people deserve to have a ruler of their own. The only question remaining is to what extent we should grant them autonomy. A new conference at Wingnot should take care of that."

 HIP_north_zebrican_union:0 "The North Zebrican Union"
 HIP_north_zebrican_union_desc:0 "It is time to formalize our cooperation with Zumidia into a North Zebrican Union. Mutual protection. economic aid and free trade, and scientific collaboration between our peoples will ensure a harmonic bulwark against any foreign threats."

 HIP_withdraw_from_zebrica:0 "Withdrawal from Zebrica"
 HIP_withdraw_from_zebrica_desc:0 "As we learned from the Storm King's rampage, Zebrica is a dangerous place. We cannot risk entangling alliances on the continent, and so we should fully release Zumidia as a sovereign state. This is what's best for Zumidia too; they deserve to carve out their own destiny. Both of us will be happier as free, separate nations."

 HIP_north_zebrican_development:0 "North Zebrican Development Commission"
 HIP_north_zebrican_development_desc:0 "All of North Zebrica will need aid industrializing and urbanizing. We can help guide our friends into the modern age and ensure a brighter future for us all. "

 HIP_north_zebrican_research:0 "North Zebrican Research Cooperative"
 HIP_north_zebrican_research_desc:0 "Education is what creates a people able to truly engage in politics without being swayed by rhetoric and thus to determine their own future.

Therefore we must ensure the best academies are available to all citizens of the North Zebrican Union, regardless of race or nationality."

 HIP_north_zebrican_federation:0 "The North Zebrican Federation"
 HIP_north_zebrican_federation_desc:0 "At long last, we stand ready to unite hippogriff, pony, seapony, and zebra in a Federation devoted to the interests of all. Together, we stand strong and ready to defy any who would threaten our lives or freedom."

 ### EVENTS ###
hippogriff.1.t: "Hurricane!"
 hippogriff.1.d: "A devastating hurricane with sustained winds over 220 kilometres per hour slammed into Hippogriffia from Warzena and Chiropterra, with the heaviest damage done to East Aris. Although our ability to shift between hippogriffs and seaponies let us avoid any deaths due to flooding, it provided no protection against the trees hurled through the air or the gusts slamming us into walls. The death toll is thankfully low, although the property damage is devastating. The economic impact of this disaster cannot yet be calculated, and many seaponies are using it as an evidence that the surface is too dangerous."
 hippogriff.1.a: "So much destruction..."

 hippogriff.100.t:0 "Zumidian Tank Trials"
 hippogriff.100.desc:0 "Over the past few weeks, the army has been trialling various proposals for tank designs in Zumidia. After our victory over the Storm King, the army searched for the latest advances in land warfare from around the world. Of particular interest was Stalliongrad's use of tanks during their revolution. Royal Island Arsenal has been hard at work developing a series of proposed tank designs and experimenting with how best to integrate them into our land forces. The original T1 prototype was scrapped early in development, but the T2 and T3 prototypes are looking promising.\n\nThe T2 is a small and fast light tank with a crew of four. It has 16mm of armour and a max speed of 72 km/h on roads. The T3, however, is the exact opposite. A joint collaboration with Equestria, the T3 is designed with a crew of ten and has a maximum speed of 10 km/h over roads. With seven guns, it is built to overwhelm the enemy with superior firepower as it advances with the infantry, rather than outmanoeuvring the enemy lines.\n\nA third contestant had also entered the trials; Cross Tide, an eccentric inventor and racing car driver, submitted his own design based purely on speed. While more lightly armoured than either the T2 or T3, Tide's tank supports a crew of two, it is armed with a 37mm cannon, and has an astonishing speed of 120 km/h on roads. However, army analysts are not confident that it could stand up to any form of anti-tank weapons that it would be liable to face.\n\nAs the trials conclude, a decision must be taken. Which design will the army adopt?"
 hippogriff.100.a:0 "The light tank should be our focus."
 hippogriff.100.b:0 "The heavy tank is the way to go."

 ### LEADERS #####
 HIP_POSADA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 14th of May, 980 in Seaquestria.\n\n§YBiography§!: For most of her childhood, Posada was ostracised by her peers. But she liked it that way, it left her more time to explore and play with her imaginary friends. She became an apprentice bookmaker in her teenaged years and later joined her local finball team eventually representing her hometown at the Pan-Seaquestrian Finball Cup. When she first went to the surface, she looked upon the starts in wonder and often would spend a lot of her time sitting on clouds at night stargazing. It was on one such night she accidently drifted over towards Zebrican territory and was captured by the Storm King's forces.\n\nPosada was chained inside the cargo hold of an airship full of looted trophies and treasures from Colthage. During the long journey she suffered at the hands of her yeti captors, but one night she was able to break free of her shackles. Sneaking through the ship's hold, she was seeking to make a quick escape and then follow the stars home when a flash of green light caught her attention.\n\nThe light ebbed from out the crack in the lid of a large golden chest intricately carved with images of horned beasts and bowing goats. Unable to help herself, she broke the chains and opened the lid. What she saw would change her forever. Images flashed before her eyes. Images of things nogriff should ever know. Images of conflict, strife, poverty and the stars, so many stars. She saw galaxies at the scale of atoms. She saw the raw power of the stars. And more, much more, she could not understand.\n\nIt is unknown how she returned to Hippogriffia. Her mind was broken, and it was months before she could talk in coherent sentences again. Shortly after the Storm King's defeat, a copy of the works of Caramel Marks crossed her desk at work. She found the book as a symbol that she was destined to rediscover what the chest had shown her and to free everycreature from the shackles of capitalism and monarchy. She founded the Revolutionary Workers' Party and quickly started preaching her ideology to every hippogriff and seapony she could.\n\n§YPortrait By§!:  AaronMK"
