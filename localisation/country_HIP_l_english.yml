 HIP_rozenkampism:0 "Lightningism"
 HIP_rozenkampism_desc:0 "Lightningism continues all of Posada's most notorious policies at an even more intense pace. Chiropterra continues to be devastated, and resources are ruthlessly extracted from North Zebrica to fuel the post-scarcity society on the home front. Calling himself the true heir of Posadism, some fear he aims to persecute ethnic minorities within Revolutionary North Zebrica due to his nationalist roots and belief in hereditary reactionaries. Crack insists the phenomenon of hereditary reactionaries is based upon culture and direct heritage, not race, but for the zebras and ponies within Revolutionary North Zebrica, that offers a small comfort as the nebulous "superculture" they are supposed to follow seems quite ill-defined."

 ### FOCUS ###
 HIP_focus_tree:0 "Hippogriffia Focus Tree"

 ### NAVY FOCUSES
 HIP_continue_navy_modernisation:0 "Continue Navy Modernisation"
 HIP_continue_navy_modernisation_desc:0 "Although our navy is already one of the most powerful in the world, we cannot afford to be lax. We must ensure our navy is always ahead of the competition. As an island nation, the navy will determine whether we live or die."

 HIP_deep_blue_war_games:0 "Deep Blue War Games"
 HIP_deep_blue_war_games_desc:0 "A strong naval doctrine is essential to success. Traditionally we have favoured striking our enemies' ships when they are in ports, but we do have other doctrinal options available should we wish to change our course. No matter what, we must choose a path."

 HIP_expand_the_marine_corps:0 "Expand the Marines"
 HIP_expand_the_marine_corps_desc:0 "When we must invade other countries, it will be the marines who will lead the way, and the landing craft that will carry them to safety. Naval invasions are a nightmare, but with grit and determination we can prevail."

 HIP_freedom_ships:0 "Freedom Ships"
 HIP_freedom_ships_desc:0 "Our civilian shipping industry is invaluable to our continued development. By producing more convoys, we'll be able to trade with our friends regardless of enemy raiding. As an added bonus, readily available convoys will make naval invasions faster."

 HIP_naval_radar:0 "Shipboard Radar"
 HIP_naval_radar_desc:0 "Radar will let us spot enemy ships through the worst conditions nature can throw at us. Future models may even be able to locate submarines or calculate better firing trajectories."

 HIP_royal_shipbuilding_committee:0 "Form the Royal Shipbuilding Committee"
 HIP_royal_shipbuilding_committee_desc:0 "Our many shipbuilders are skilled but disorganized. Different styles, gun measurements, and even engine designs prevail across the country. By forming a committee to centralise administrations and establish national standards, we can drastically speed up production."

 HIP_seapony_squardrens:0 "Seapony Squadrons"
 HIP_seapony_squardrens_desc:0 "We have a long and storied history of the use of submarines. By forming dedicated squadrons of seaponies to crew them, we can quickly adapt to looming problems with design."

 HIP_underwater_supremacy:0 "Underwater Supremacy"
 HIP_underwater_supremacy_desc:0 "As a nation of seaponies, we can afford to invest even further in submarines. As our submarines don't have to carry air, we can hide like ghosts. Our submarines will strike at any troop transports and escape into the depths. No one will ever be able to take our home from us again!"

 HIP_expand_the_escort_fleet:0 "Expand the Escort Fleet"
 HIP_expand_the_escort_fleet_desc:0 "When trading with other nations, it's absolutely critical to make sure our shipments arrive safely. We lack many resources other nations enjoy, and to keep our war machine operational we must protect our trade routes. Modern destroyers will keep our convoys safe."

 HIP_battleship_primacy:0 "Battleship Primacy"
 HIP_battleship_primacy_desc:0 "The battleship is the ultimate expression of naval dominance, and the backbone of the navy. With a large enough battlefleet, no one will ever dare to attack us."

 HIP_imperious_class:0 "The Imperious Class Project"
 HIP_imperious_class_desc:0 "Our naval theorists have discussed a design for a new battleship. This proposed "super heavy battleship" will carry guns twenty-one meters long. It will no doubt be an enormous investment of resources, but when completed it will tear even the battleships of the future to shreds."

 HIP_air_sea_warfare:0 "Air-Sea Warfare"
 HIP_air_sea_warfare_desc:0 "As a people who can shift from soaring through the skies to swimming under the seas, it's only logical to focus our efforts on a navy that does the same. Pairing planes with boats will not only be a symbol of our unity, it will let us strike our enemies in their bases with ease!"

 HIP_rapid_strike_tactics:0 "Rapid Strike Tactics"
 HIP_rapid_strike_tactics_desc:0 "Our pilots will have to fly in quickly, execute their mission, and then return to the carrier to fuel up. We can accelerate this process by refuelling and reequipping in the air."

 HIP_naval_aeronautics_committee:0 "Naval Aeronautics Committee"
 HIP_naval_aeronautics_committee_desc:0 "With our new focus on carriers, we will also need to modernize our carrier planes. Forming a Naval Aeronautics Committee will help us move boldly into the future and strike any navy that dares oppose us."

 ### INDUSTRY FOCUSES
 HIP_seapony_primacy:0 "Seapony Primacy"
 HIP_seapony_primacy_desc:0 "We survived the Storm King's invasion by hiding underwater. The sea shelters us, and it must be the sea we rely upon going forward. Even with modern submarines, our enemies can't reach the sea floor, so we'll always have a safe place to flee to."

 HIP_hippogriff_primacy:0 "Hippogriff Primacy"
 HIP_hippogriff_primacy_desc:0 "We can't afford to cower in the depths any longer. The world is changing, and if we are to take our place as a preeminent nation among the peoples of the world, it's time to change too."

 HIP_expand_the_underwater_dockyards:0 "Expand the Underwater Dockyards"
 HIP_expand_the_underwater_dockyards_desc:0 "The underwater dockyards allow us to produce and repair ships away from our enemies. With a navy being repaired safe from all harm, we will be able to enjoy true naval supremacy, striking our enemies in port while our own ports are underwater."

 HIP_underwater_construction:0 "Underwater Construction"
 HIP_underwater_construction_desc:0 "Constructing buildings underwater makes them immune to strategic bombing. As long as Seaquestria stands with us, we will have an impervious industry."
 
 HIP_shell_oil:0 "Shell Oil Company"
 HIP_shell_oil_desc:0 "Although we have a reasonable amount of crude oil, it isn't enough to fuel our massive navy. We'll need to develop our oil refining process, and synthetic refineries are also worth looking into."
 
 HIP_support_the_oil_industry:0 "Support the Oil Industry"
 HIP_support_the_oil_industry_desc:0 "There's only so far we can get with improving refining. A great wealth of oil lies under the ocean floor, and we can tap into it with modern extraction. Synthetic oil has also been developed by some other countries of the world, and would help us supplant our natural reserves."

 HIP_national_road_network:0 "National Road Network"
 HIP_national_road_network_desc:0 "By constructing a nationwide road network, we can speed up all our future construction. It'll also be useful for supplying any military operations. It will move our society in favor of hippogriffs, however."

 HIP_underwater_railways:0 "Underwater Railways"
 HIP_underwater_railways_desc:0 "Building underwater rails will make future underwater construction much faster, and even help us build things on the surface should we desire to. It will move our society in favor of seaponies, however."

 HIP_public_infrastructure_works:0 "Public Infrastructure Works"
 HIP_public_infrastructure_works_desc:0 "We are a peaceful and isolationist people. It's only sensible to build better roads and bridges to improve our citizens' quality of life."

 HIP_bellbreeze_aircraft_corporation_focus:0 "Form the Bellbreeze Aircraft Corporation"
 HIP_bellbreeze_aircraft_corporation_focus_desc:0 "We are a naturally airborne people. When we fight our enemies in the skies, directing our efforts to maneuverability will let us shoot them down while dodging their attacks."

 HIP_air_industry_fund:0 "Expand Aircraft Funds"
 HIP_air_industry_fund_desc:0 "We need more fighters. They shoot down enemy bombers and escort ours to their destination. [HIP.GetLeader] has approved a special fund for fighters, using some of the royal treasury to personally cover costs."

 HIP_department_of_commerce:0 "Form the Department of Commerce"
 HIP_department_of_commerce_desc:0 "While we are a modern nation, the fact remains that as the world changes at breakneck speed, we run the risk of being left behind. If we are to safeguard our technological advantage, we need to keep advancing."

 HIP_office_of_industral_sciences:0 "Open the Office of Industrial Sciences"
 HIP_office_of_industral_sciences_desc:0 "There are so many topics we can be investigating, from machinery to electronics to battleships to our own biology. We need to open a new branch of the government dedicated exclusively to research and innovation. This Office of Industrial Sciences will ensure we are never behind our peers."

 HIP_grand_alaudia_bauxite_mine:0 "Mine Bauxite in Alaudia"
 HIP_grand_alaudia_bauxite_mine_desc:0 "Airplanes require aluminium, and our armed forces require a mighty airforce. Our geologists have reported there are massive piles of aluminium in Alaudia. Although it will take time and effort, the rewards will be immense."

 HIP_develop_starfield_steelworks:0 "Develop Starfield Steelworks"
 HIP_develop_starfield_steelworks_desc:0 "Nearly everything we produce needs steel, from shovels to battleships. Starfield is the center of our refining of iron ore into steel, so it's only logical to expand production there."

 ### ARMY FOCUSES
 HIP_defence_department:0 "Department of Defence"
 HIP_defence_department_desc:0 "In a world filled with threats, we will need a strong army to safeguard our borders. This Department will both cover our army's modernisation and its central administration."

 HIP_modern_weapon_contests:0 "Modern Weaponry Contests"
 HIP_modern_weapon_contests_desc:0 "By holding contests for the best-designed guns and grenades, we can ensure top-of-the-line performance for all our troops. Soldiers are in short supply, so our guns have to be the best we can possibly make them."

 HIP_army_armament_bonds:0 "Armament Bonds"
 HIP_army_armament_bonds_desc:0 "Selling bonds will help us raise the money to build weapons factories. In the event we're attacked, it'll also let us quickly liquidate our funds to shift civilian factories to military ones."

 HIP_continue_army_modernisation:0 "Continue Army Modernisation"
 HIP_continue_army_modernisation_desc:0 "As a small nation, we have always believed that our first and foremost priority for the army should be better guns than our foes. Some military theorists advocate for changing our course, while others say that what has served us well should remain. Either way, keeping our theory of war modern is absolutely critical in these times."

 HIP_fund_royal_island:0 "Fund the Royal Island Gunworks"
 HIP_fund_royal_island_desc:0 "We have long used cannons in our armies. Big guns let us blast our enemies from afar, keeping our own troops safe. Having Royal Island design new artillery will let us prepare for whatever our enemies throw at us!"

 HIP_army_motorisation:0 "Motorising the Army"
 HIP_army_motorisation_desc:0 "Any attacks on our soil will have to be quickly repulsed, and any terrorist action countered swiftly. Armored cars and mechanized troop transports will keep our soldiers safe as they go wherever they are needed."

 HIP_armor_training_school:0 "Armored Operations Training"
 HIP_armor_training_school_desc:0 "Tanks can punch through lines and quickly encircle enemies. Even if we choose to avoid aggression, tank destroyers are very useful for stopping our enemies' armored advances."

 HIP_royal_engineers_corps:0 "Expand the Royal Engineer Corps"
 HIP_royal_engineers_corps_desc:0 "Combat engineers can dig trenches, set explosives to breach forts, and operate flamethrowers to smoke our foes out. We must not neglect our engineers, especially the defenses they can give to protect our home."

 HIP_signle_and_logistics_school:0 "A School for Signals and Logistics"
 HIP_signle_and_logistics_school_desc:0 "Modern warfare involves more than guns and planes; it also involves distribution of goods and quick communication. Creating a school dedicated to these less visible but still vital topics will make sure we can synchronize and plan with lightning speed."

 HIP_invite_griffon_officers:0 "Invite Griffon Theorists"
 HIP_invite_griffon_officers_desc:0 "The Griffonian school of war has long been that maximal planning and preparation is the method by which victory is won. We can approach them for guidance on our own war machine to help us organize properly."

 HIP_lessons_from_the_enemy:0 "Lessons from the Enemy"
 HIP_lessons_from_the_enemy_desc:0 "The Storm King's tactics were brutal yet effective. Rapidly organized plans and swift offensives let him conquer most of Zebrica, and doing the same could let us take the fight to any would-be conquerors."

 HIP_grand_alaudia_training_grounds:0 "Training Grounds at Grand Alaudia"
 HIP_grand_alaudia_training_grounds_desc:0 "Grand Alaudia has both jungles and plains, and it's respectably distant from Mount Aris. Summoning our entire army there to practice war games, and then conducting extensive surveys on the experience of both foot soldiers and generals, will help us reorganize our army and refine our military doctrine."

 HIP_air_to_ground_warfare:0 "Air-to-Ground Warfare"
 HIP_air_to_ground_warfare_desc:0 "Paratroopers can land behind enemy lines and quickly disrupt their flow of supply. If we can capture their capitals and industrial centers, we might be able to win wars without ever firing a shot."

 HIP_special_service_force:0 "Special Forces Concentration"
 HIP_special_service_force_desc:0 "Special forces, from mountaineers to paratroopers to even more exotic possibilities like amphibious tanks, are a defining part of the [HIP.GetAdjective] military. We'll need to train more to cover our various operations and maximize the impact of our limited soldiers."

 HIP_jungle_special_forces_school:0 "Jungle Special Forces School"
 HIP_jungle_special_forces_school_desc:0 "Jungles are a nightmare to fight on for everyone. However, we have many jungles across our lands, and by training troops in jungle warfare, we can give our special forces a deadly edge in this dangerous terrain."

 HIP_mountain_warfare_school:0 "Mountain Warfare School"
 HIP_mountain_warfare_school_desc:0 "Mountaineers are a necessity on on any mountain terrain, and as our capital lies atop a great mountain, we'll need to invest heavily to protect it. Mountaineers can make the ost of our home, securing it against any attack."

 HIP_national_defence_draft:0 "National Defence Draft"
 HIP_national_defence_draft_desc:0 "In these terrifying times, we have to take drastic measures. [HIP.GetLeader] has, after extensive deliberation, decided to institute a limited draft. This decision is not taken lightly, but we must ensure the safety of all seaponies and hippogriffs. [HIP.GetName] will never flee again!"

 HIP_royal_legion_of_aris:0 "The Royal Legion of Aris"
 HIP_royal_legion_of_aris_desc:0 "We love peace, but in a violent world, sometimes the only way to preserve peace is to fight. The Royal Legion of Aris will preserve our rights and protect our home against anyone who would take it from us."

 ### AIR FOCUSES
 HIP_air_armament_committee:0 "Establish the Air Armament Committee"
 HIP_air_armament_committee_desc:0 "As the world recovers from the Storm King's defeat, it's more important than ever to make sure we have a strong air force to keep our people safe. Whether that's fighters to protect our own airspace, or bombers to take out the enemy's ability to wage war, we have to be ready for whatever the world throws at us."

 HIP_air_land_warfare_focus:0 "Air-Land Warfare"
 HIP_air_land_warfare_focus_desc:0 "Any war must ultimately be won on land. By focusing our air force around winning land battles, we can push our enemies back whenever they advance, securing our borders forever."

 HIP_tactical_bombing:0 "Tactical Bomber Initiative"
 HIP_tactical_bombing_desc:0 "While we favor close air support to win land battles, tactical bombers are a necessity to cover other operations. They can execute any mission with reasonable effectiveness, from strategic bombing to close air support, and are thus wonderfully flexible."

 HIP_escort_fighters:0 "Escort Fighters"
 HIP_escort_fighters_desc:0 "Our bombers will need protection. Whether strategic bombers deep in enemy territory or CAS striking our straits, heavy fighters can reach across vast distances and defend bombers from local planes."

 HIP_consolidated_aircraft_focus:0 "Consolidated Aircraft"
 HIP_consolidated_aircraft_focus_desc:0 "An airforce built for immense range will let us fight our opponents across the continents. The Consolidated Aircraft company has already offered to aid us in our development."

 HIP_fighter_working_group:0 "Fighter Working Group"
 HIP_fighter_working_group_desc:0 "Enemy bombers will inevitably target our homes and factories. We swam underwater to escape the Storm King's armies, but as much of our industry is on land, doing so is immensely costly. Building fighters will let us engage bombers before they strike our land."

 HIP_young_flyers_programme:0 "Young Fliers Program"
 HIP_young_flyers_programme_desc:0 "Are you doing your part? Our air force is the shield against our foes' bombs and the spear we ready against their charges. If we make this clear to our people, we're bound to have many young hippogriffs flocking to the air force!"

 HIP_academy_of_air_sciences:0 "Academy of Aerial Science"
 HIP_academy_of_air_sciences_desc:0 "With new plane models rolling off the assembly lines, we ought to found a new academy dedicated to the theory of air warfare. We'll likely be able to research other, more esoteric technologies as well..."

 HIP_jet_engine_development:0 "Jet Engines"
 HIP_jet_engine_development_desc:0 "The jet engine has the potential to completely revolutionize flight. With it, we might even be able to break the sound barrier. We can't afford to neglect this promising new field of study!"

 HIP_rocketry_school:0 "Department of Rocketry"
 HIP_rocketry_school_desc:0 "Rockets—self-propelled missiles packed with liquid or solid fuel—have the potential to strike a base in the [CHN.GetName] from the comfort of our own mountain. A way to wage war without a single hippogriff or seapony ever having to leave home is incredibly tempting for obvious reasons. We need to find out more!"

 HIP_atom_committee:0 "Atomic Committee"
 HIP_atom_committee_desc:0 "Our scientists have long known that matter is made up of atoms. Recent findings suggest that certain atoms, in particular uranium and plutonium, can be split, and that such an event, properly controlled, could cause a chain reaction, unleashing incalculable destruction and loss of civilian life. We don't want to kill innocents, of course, but even having such a weapon could prove a mighty deterrent. In the long run, this weapon could aid the cause of peace."

 HIP_strategic_obliteration_doctraine:0 "Strategic Obliteration Doctrine"
 HIP_strategic_obliteration_doctraine_desc:0 "Victory in war can only be achieved by the total obliteration of our enemy's capability to wage war. Without air bases, dockyards, railways, roads, mines, stockpiles, and industries they will have no capability to stand up to us and the morale of the enemy's population will plummet."

 HIP_bomber_offensive:0 "Bomber Offensive"
 HIP_bomber_offensive_desc:0 "The total destruction of the enemy's capability to wage war can only be achieved by increasing the size of our bomber fleet. More bombers means more bombs, and more bombs means fewer guns for the enemy."

 HIP_trans_continental_air_warfare:0 "Transcontinental Air Warfare"
 HIP_trans_continental_air_warfare_desc:0 "Our enemies lie across the seas on three continents. We must be able to strike them wherever they might be."

 HIP_cluster_bombing:0 "Cluster Bombing"
 HIP_cluster_bombing_desc:0 "We have developed advanced bombs that eject smaller bomblets specifically designed to eliminate enemy personnel and vehicles. The bomblets are dispersed in a wide area in a single precision strike."

 #Political Focuses
 HIP_plecate_the_isolationists:0 "Placating the Isolationists"
 HIP_plecate_the_isolationists_desc:0 "The isolationist policies have long been championed by the seaponies, who view recent events as evidence that we should stick with isolationism instead of opening up. If we are to make progress, we have to make sure that they are placated."

 HIP_self_efficency:0 "Seapony Autarky"
 HIP_self_efficency_desc:0 "Hippogriffia survived for centuries on its own, and it would be beyond irresponsible to abandon this policy. Between invaders, slavers, mad foreigners and countless other threats, we must make sure to rally all the strength we possess for the benefit of our nation, not others'."

 HIP_anti_harmonic_activities_committee:0 "The Anti-Harmonic Activities Committee"
 HIP_anti_harmonic_activities_committee_desc:0 "Stalliongrad, Chiropterra, Griffonia, the Stormlanders: foreign ideologies and interests can be found everywhere, and many of these are driven by interests directly opposed to ours. We must carefully weigh these ideas, and determine which ones are a threat to our way of life and which aren't."

 HIP_committie_for_national_defence:0 "The Comittee for National Defense"
 HIP_committie_for_national_defence_desc:0 "War will come to our nation's borders once again, whether sooner or later. The ravages of the Storm King proved that we cannot simply hide, but the next time foreign princesses will not come along to save us. We must plan for all scenarios from now on, no matter how dire."

 HIP_expand_the_royal_acadamy:0 "Universal Education"
 HIP_expand_the_royal_acadamy_desc:0 "Every child born in our nation has the right to be given a full education, both on land and in the sea. Whether rich or poor, and whether seapony or hippogriff, we cannot leave anyone behind."

 HIP_long_distance_friendship:0 "Long Distance Friendship"
 HIP_long_distance_friendship_desc:0 "We want to be self-reliant, but that does not mean that we are going to forget the friends we do have. Those who give kindness can be given it in return, and we will both be stronger for it."

 HIP_leand_lease:0 "Lend-Lease"
 HIP_leand_lease_desc:0 "Even if we cannot directly aid our friends in war, we can still make sure they are given the tools needed to finish the job. Our factories stand ready to churn out countless weapons needed, and our friends will have access to it for the lowest price we can charge."

 HIP_the_mountain_awakes:0 "The Mountain Awakes"
 HIP_the_mountain_awakes_desc:0 "We were asleep, but now we have awaken. The mountain is no longer silent, but it resonates with the sound of labour and preperations. Beware, all who would threaten us. We are ready for you, and we will be your undoing."

 HIP_traditional_studdies:0 "Never Forget Our Roots"
 HIP_traditional_studdies_desc:0 "We cannot, must not, forget who we are. To ensure this, our children will receieve a throrough education in our history and traditions, and all who wish to work towards its preservation and continuation will be given support in their endevours."

 HIP_prepare_for_the_next_war:0 "Prepare For the Next War"

 HIP_expand_costal_fortifications:0 "Expand Coastal Fortifications"
 HIP_expand_costal_fortifications_desc:0 "Anycreature who sets a single hoof or claw on our islands will be met with resistance from the get-go. If they establish a beachhead, it might already be too late, so we must make sure they will never be able to."

 HIP_youth_defence_league:0 "The Youth Defense League"
 HIP_youth_defence_league_desc:0 "We would never place our children in harms way, but in war there are many duties necessary, including several that will keep them able to aid in the struggle, but still remain out of the way of the actual fighting."

 HIP_never_to_fall_again:0 "As the War Approaches"
 HIP_never_to_fall_again_desc:0 "When the Storm King came, we could have lost everything. The next time war comes - and it will come sooner or later - we shall be ready to meet it with all the strength we have."

 HIP_trade_ports:0 "Designated Trade Ports"
 HIP_trade_ports_desc:0 "Contrary to what some claim, we are not looking to stick our heads in the sand and ignore the outside world. The cities of Winggarden, Howlington, and Canterford will be dedicated to trade with the outside world, and through it we can still be part of the world while watching its influence on us."

 HIP_agricultral_reforms:0 "Agricultural Reforms"
 HIP_agricultral_reforms_desc:0 "The agricultural sector has been left languishing in recent times. With all the development both internally and abroad, the time has come for a dedicated effort to make sure that our farmers can keep feeding our people even if the worst happens."

 HIP_encourage_private_enterprise:0 "Encourage Private Enterprises"
 HIP_encourage_private_enterprise_desc:0 "As our nation grows, so will its industry, but it'd only bloat the nation to try to run everything centrally.

 HIP_national_defence_works:0 "National Defense Works"
 HIP_national_defence_works_desc:0 "Modern wars are won not just on the battlefield, but in the factories as well. We must be ready to produce immense amounts of weaponry for when the war comes, and there is no time like the present to get started."

 HIP_stock_exchange:0 "The Aris Stock Exchange"
 HIP_stock_exchange_desc:0 "The world is woven together more tightly than ever before, and like the currents and winds, trade, wealth and prosperity is more understood as a "flow" than a fixed thing. Opening the Aris Stock Exchange will let us partake in this flow, and control it to some extent."

 HIP_develop_our_outer_islands:0 "Developing the Outer Islands"
 HIP_develop_our_outer_islands_desc:0 "Mount Aris is the gleaming jewel of Hippogriffia, but a jewel needs a necklace to hold it. Too long, we have ignored the golden ring of islands around us, and this must be rectified."

 HIP_encourage_tourism:0 "Come on Down to Hippogriffia!"
 HIP_encourage_tourism_desc:0 "Our home is among the most beautiful regions in the world, and visitors agree. Opening up for tourist enterprises will net us another source of revenue, as well as making sure that thousands of creatures across the world will go home with positive experiences of us."

 HIP_cut_industral_red_tape:0 "Cut the Industrial Red Tape"
 HIP_cut_industral_red_tape_desc:0 "Our industry suffers from miles upon miles of red tape. It might have been well-intentioned, but it is simply stifling us. Rationalizing the bureaucracy, doing away with some of the regulatory framework and consolidating the management of the remainder into a new organization will benefit our economy immensely."

 HIP_moderate_racism:0 "A Clean Break"
 HIP_moderate_racism_desc:0 "Raft Wood argues that we have already wasted too much money on ungrateful Zumidians.

 HIP_hardline_racism:0 "They Have Their Uses"
 HIP_hardline_racism_desc:0 "Crack Lightning insists that Zumidia is too ore-rich to abandon entirely, and that its zebras could prove useful.

 HIP_fate_of_the_imperialists_desc:0 "Worse than even fascists are imperialists; those who would conquer and subjugate and pillage and burn simply to satisfy their own hunger for more. Hippogriffia slew one such tyrant a few years ago. The time has come to finish off the rest of them."
 HIP_admiral_skystar:0 "Promote New Admirals"
 HIP_admiral_skystar_desc:0 "We will have the largest and grandest navy in the world, and such a fleet will by nature necessitate many new officers. With the sacking of several counterrevolutionary officers, the need is more urgent than ever. Perhaps we can arrange a naval wargame for members of the naval commissariat, to see which of these enthusiastic young revolutionaries is fit to command a fleet..."

 HIP_communists_have_music_desc:0 "Culture is a core part of society, and revolutionary culture must be promoted. Every form of art shall be cultivated and brought to light, so that the proletarian can truly enjoy life. Labor songs will be sung throughout the land, murals depicting the might of the worker shall be painted, and all will share in the benefits and joys!"
 HIP_junior_pioneers:0 "The Junior Pioneers"
 HIP_junior_pioneers_desc:0 "The children are the future of the revolution, and it is paramount that they be trained and taught. As communists we follow a process to achieve communism, and it will be the children raised in a dictatorship of the proletariat who will finally lead us there. They are not merely pioneers of their peers; they are pioneers of the future for us all."
 HIP_praxis_backed_by_theory:0 "Praxis Backed by Theory"
 HIP_praxis_backed_by_theory_desc:0 "Theory without praxis is navel-gazing, and praxis without theory is chaos. Only together can communism be achieved, and so together we shall forge the future. Everyone in the nation will receive a full education, going as far as they desire. Be it technical, academic, or martial, no one shall be untaught!"
 HIP_centeral_committee_of_national_administration:0 "The Central Committee"
 HIP_centeral_committee_of_national_administration_desc:0 "A revolution requires central administration. While some comrades believe it should be limited and small, only anarchists seriously argue for a lack of any centralization. Therefore the Central Committee will be created to ensure activities are controlled and managed on a national level."
 HIP_the_hearts_of_the_griffs:0 "The Hearts of the People"
 HIP_the_hearts_of_the_griffs_desc:0 "False consciousness is a troubling element in every state. Some workers simply do not understand how communism will aid them personally, and believe the capitalist lies that we seek to oppress and hurt them. Therefore we will begin a massive education wave, accompanied by sweeping reforms, to show the people that we are on their side. No proletarian should fear their own dictatorship."
 HIP_raceless_society:0 "Raceless Society"
 HIP_raceless_society_desc:0 "Hippogriff, seapony, zebra, or pony; all are equals in our new communist society. Racism shall be eradicated completely, and those ethnonationalists who would drive a wedge between workers will face the workers' justice!"
 HIP_kickstart_nuclear_program:0 "The Atom Burns Blue"
 HIP_kickstart_nuclear_program_desc:0 "General Secretary Posada has always known that the mighty atom is the hammer with which we shall break the back of capitalism. Our nuclear program must be the most powerful in the world. We shall develop atomic energy that will show the world just how mighty the force of international communism truly is! With weapons such as these, the Storm Kings of the world will cower in terror!"
 HIP_eradicate_poverty:0 "Annihilate Poverty"
 HIP_eradicate_poverty_desc:0 "Every worker, farmer, and soldier deserves a rich, fulfilling life. While many other left-wing states have made efforts to abolish poverty, in most of them the workers did not have the benefit of a truly prosperous economy. Here in Hippogriffia, we are blessed with one of the wealthiest economies in the world, and so we have the capability to reach a 0% poverty rate."
 HIP_seize_private_industires:0 "The Factories of the Future"
 HIP_seize_private_industires_desc:0 "It is absolutely necessary that we continue industrialization and mechanization as intensively as possible. We are surrounded by capitalist vultures eying us hungrily, and to show weakness for an instance risks being devoured. Therefore all private industries shall be seized and nationalized, subject to collectivization as quickly as possible."
 HIP_collectivise_the_farmland:0 "Collective Farms"
 HIP_collectivise_the_farmland_desc:0 "It is insufficient to have the state running all business, for in such a case we have simply created a new form of capitalism--state capitalism! The workers must be placed in charge of their economic production. The easiest place to start will be the seaweed and algae farms, which have always been a hotbed of shared cooperation."
 HIP_share_the_means_of_production:0 "Worker-Owned Means of Production"
 HIP_share_the_means_of_production_desc:0 "Every worker shall own the means of production. The state shall act as administrator when necessary, but all returns shall be directed back into the workers who toil for the good of each other. This, of course, is a temporary arrangement; once our position is secured, we will be able to move beyond the need for a profit-driven economy and into a utility or even gift economy."
 HIP_ensure_luxuary_goods_production:0 "Luxury for All"
 HIP_ensure_luxuary_goods_production_desc:0 "An adequate life is inadequate; good enough is not good enough. Luxury, previously the privilege of the wealthy, can now be the right of all workers. No more shall naysayers claim that communism is the equal sharing of miseries!"
 HIP_establish_the_csr:0 "Establish the CSR"
 HIP_establish_the_csr_desc:0 "However much we may wish it was otherwise, there are still dangerous elements seeking to destroy our communist society. We must form an intelligence agency with strong powers of investigation to root out active and present threats. However, we cannot let such an organization become oppressive. The Committee for the Security of the Revolution will not be turned into a weapon against the people."
 HIP_standardise_living_conditions:0 "Standardize Living Conditions"
 HIP_standardise_living_conditions_desc:0 "In some allegedly communist states,the party bureaucrats rise to wealth and privilege above their comrades.

 HIP_revolutionary_underwater_construction:0 "Aqueous Construction Initiative"
 HIP_revolutionary_underwater_construction_desc:0 "Seaquestria is as much a part of Revolutionary North Zebrica as Mount Aris, and while there are a million engineering and logistical challenges to conducting heavy industry underwater, building factories in Seaquestria will keep them out of reach of our countless enemies.

 HIP_the_immortal_science_of_dialectical_materialism_desc:0 "Caramel Marks was a great scholar, and more than that, she was a great pony. But she is dead, and to adhere to her ideas blindly is to adopt a new religion. We must always apply her methods to her own writings, and to every so-called leftist state in the world. Only then can we see true communism begin to emerge."
 HIP_prepare_for_first_strike:0 "War Plan Uranium"
 HIP_prepare_for_first_strike_desc:0 "Colthage and Chiropterra, two evil states.

 HIP_fate_of_bat:0 "The Fate of Chiropterra"
 HIP_fate_of_bat_desc:0 "The struggle is over, and Chiropterra lies defeated. But as ever more reports of insurgent terrorism flood in, we must determine its future.

The decision is up to the General Secretary."
 HIP_fate_high_command:0 "The Fate of the High Command"
 HIP_fate_high_command_desc:0 "Three of the six ponies who ran this monstrous system have been captured, with only one fate awaiting: death.

 HIP_steal_chiropterras_stuff:0 "The Dark Side of the Moon"
 HIP_steal_chiropterras_stuff_desc:0 "The Nightmarists discovered horrifying things in their pursuit of victory at any cost. While we cannot abide such cruel experimentation, we can certainly benefit from their findings and utilize these discoveries against other reactionaries. But it might be better to let these secrets lie buried with their researchers. In the end, Posada has the final say."

 HIP_secrets_of_the_night_desc:0 "Chiropterra has always been a reclusive, hidden nation. But no longer. We have a modern intelligence agency and we will penetrate their veil of secrecy.

 HIP_exotic_weapons:0 "Form the Exotic Weaponry Commission"
 HIP_exotic_weapons_desc:0 "Shock and awe is a powerful force on the battlefield, and few things can impose it as well as weapons never seen before. Super-heavy tanks, APCs, helicopters, ground effect vehicles, and more will be investigated, and funding devoted to find the most effective methods of application. While this might prove costly in the short run, the long-term benefits of awe-inspiring weaponry will be immense."
 HIP_undersea_reactors:0 "Undersea Reactors"
 HIP_undersea_reactors_desc:0 "Previously deemed too detrimental on the environment, undersea reactors are rapidly proving necessary.

 HIP_depleted_uranium:0 "Depleted Uranium Applications"
 HIP_depleted_uranium_desc:0 "After nuclear refining is done, we have massive surpluses of depleted uranium left behind.

 HIP_expand_crystal_mining:0 "Crystal Extraction & Synthesis"
 HIP_expand_crystal_mining_desc:0 "More reactors require more crystals, and we cannot rely on imports in a world filled with enemies. The crystal mines of Mount Aris must be expanded, and we must begin efforts to create synthetic crystals. Our nation needs crystals far more than rubber anyway."
 HIP_integrate_cth:0 "Sweep the Remainder"
 HIP_integrate_cth_desc:0 "Quaggatai is a nation run by reactionaries for reactionary ends. It must be defeated for the sake of the lives under it and the lives of those adjacent to it. Macawia has long been a harmonic land, but unfortunately it has proven resistant to communism and focuses on free trade. We will seize these lands through diplomacy or combat as material conditions require."
 HIP_attack_cth:0 "Free the Slaves"
 HIP_attack_cth_desc:0 "Colthage has long been a "republic", and yet they still have such awful institutions as slavery. Is this not the ultimate proof of the failure of reactionary democracy?

 HIP_absolute_education:0 "Absolute Right to Learn"
 HIP_absolute_education_desc:0 "Any creature that desires to learn shall be able to. From preschool to graduate, all learning will be provided for by the state.

 HIP_harmonic_cooperation:0 "Cooperate with the Harmonists"
 HIP_harmonic_cooperation_desc:0 "Comrade Silverstream leads a minority faction in the party advocating for avoiding excessive brutality or authoritarianism. Should we align with these ideas, we may find relations with Equestria thawing. The fact is that harmony is a vastly less terrible system to live under than supremacy, so why shouldn't we work together to destroy the latter?"
 HIP_democratic_centralism:0 "Democratic Centralism"
 HIP_democratic_centralism_desc:0 "It is only logical to follow Steel Stallion's application and allow for the majority to rule, as they do in bourgeois democracies. As we are a party, however, after the voting is concluded, everycreature must abide willingly by the ruling. This is the best and fairest way to ensure the workers' say is heard, and the reactionaries do not gain undue power over us."
 HIP_one_party_many_wings:0 "One Party with Many Wings"
 HIP_one_party_many_wings_desc:0 "Harmonic socialist, anarchist, communist, and otherwise, all are welcome in our party so long as they abide by the rules. Ideological diversity is vital to the survival of the party, just as genetic diversity is vital to the survival of a species."

 HIP_councilism:0 "Council Communism"
 HIP_councilism_desc:0 "The dictatorship of the proletariat must be controlled by the proletarians themselves.

 HIP_devolve_power_to_councils_desc:0 "Why should party bureaucrats hold authority over the people they are meant to serve? It is absolutely vital that the workers themselves hold their fate in their own fins, and so we will put in place safeguards against repression and tyranny. The Supreme Workers' Council and the office of General Secretary will have powers revoked as a precaution."
 HIP_the_hippogriff_model:0 "The North Zebrican Model"
 HIP_the_hippogriff_model_desc:0 "Steel Stallion was a great pony, but to call yourself a "Stallionist" is to put up a hero to be worshipped instead of another traveler along the same path. We must always improve upon those that have gone before, and Stalliongrad's system fell to infighting and factionalism after Stallion's death. We need to guarantee that will not happen here, and so our government will be built accordingly."
 HIP_no_compromise_on_communism:0 "No Compromise on Communism"
 HIP_no_compromise_on_communism_desc:0 "Communism is the real movement that abolishes the current state of things.

 HIP_organic_centralism:0 "Organic Centralism"
 HIP_organic_centralism_desc:0 "The Party is the most class-conscious part of the proletariat. Therefore it must be willing to overrule the majority, who cling to false consciousness learned from life under capitalism.

 HIP_a_state_built_on_theory:0 "A State Built on Theory"
 HIP_a_state_built_on_theory_desc:0 "We must consult every part of the party and then make decisions in accordance with revolutionary theory. This requires the party be well-informed, and for as many creatures as possible to become members so that all may be heard.

 HIP_towards_post_scarcity:0 "Towards Post-Scarcity"
 HIP_towards_post_scarcity_desc:0 "One of the greatest aims of a communist society is to abolish scarcity. While we are not yet in a place to eliminate scarcity of weapons, we can do so for civilian desires, at least in peacetime. This will be a significant drain on our economy, but it will be worth it. Isn't the goal of communism a better life for the worker?"
 HIP_industrial_bureaus:0 "Found New Industrial Bureaus"

 HIP_an_admitted_monster:0 "An Admitted Monster"
 HIP_an_admitted_monster_desc:0 "Posada did terrible things by her own admission. We can respect the good work she did for the workers without praising or legitimizing the atrocities she committed. For the nation to begin healing, it is time for all of us to confess our own wrongdoings."

 HIP_our_eternal_hero_desc:0 "Comrade Posada didn't receive the mental and emotional support she clearly needed, which is why she came to believe that she was somehow at fault for doing what had to be done to ensure the surviavl of the revolution.

 HIP_radiation_proof_armor:0 "Radiation-Proof Armor"
 HIP_radiation_proof_armor_desc:0 "With the increased commonality of nuclear devices on the battlefield, our forces will need to be properly protected. This in turn requires that we develop thick lead armor for our mechanized and tank units, and reshape the tank design to allow the blast wave to flow around it.

 HIP_thermonuclear_aims:0 "Thermonuclear Aims"
 HIP_thermonuclear_aims_desc:0 "Nuclear weapons are valuable at the tactical and strategic level, but as they have proliferated, the shock value has decreased. To truly project our power on a planetary level, we need something more.

 HIP_tritium_amassment:0 "Tritium Amassment"
 HIP_tritium_amassment_desc:0 "In order to construct such a weapon, we will need plentiful fuel. Fusion weapons require entirely different fuel than fission, and we're essentially starting from scratch. We will begin purchasing lithium-6 and bombarding it with neutrons to create our tritium."

 HIP_cult_of_the_atom_desc:0 "Isn't there something almost transcendental about the eternal dance of fusion and fission? The beauty of a self-sustaining reaction, the four protium atoms slammed together into helium at the core of a star, these are more than merely interesting phenomena.

 HIP_thermonuclear_arsenal_desc:0 "One weapon does not make an arsenal.

 HIP_prepare_the_people_desc:0 "This war is likely going to wipe out a large swath of sapient life. It will be incalculably destructive. But it must be done, because if it's not done then the imperialists will keep the world as it is now, in its endless cycles of chaos and conquest. We weep for every life we must take, but we soldier on because the alternative is too awful to consider."

 HIP_investigate_the_esoteric_desc:0 "Even as science conquers the world, there is still so much more we don't understand. Vast aspects of magic still remain the purview of individual sorcerers instead of being widely replicable, and other questions, such as if we are alone in the universe, have yet to be answered.

 HIP_mount_aris_radar_array_desc:0 "To properly stargaze, we will require a gigantic radio telescope atop Mount Aris. We will look to the stars and see if we find anyone else looking back at us! As a side effect, such a radar system will likely aid in detecting any hostile planes."

 HIP_anarchia_mama:0 "A Different Approach"
 HIP_anarchia_mama_desc:0 "This war has only confirmed the fears of the anarchists relating to "Revolutionary North Zebrica": the supposedly materialist authoritarian communists are in fact themselves utopian idealists, lost in their visions of post-scarcity and blind to the real material conditions of this nation-state.

 HIP_prepare_insurrection:0 "Prepare an Insurrection"
 HIP_prepare_insurrection_desc:0 "The blue tyrants have betrayed us before, and there is no doubt they will do so again when the opportunity presents itself.

 HIP_our_own_anarchism:0 "Seaquestria's Own Anarchist Society"
 HIP_our_own_anarchism_desc:0 "Anarchism is more than a word. It is the opposition to all tyrants, to all powers, to any form of control. We are not anarchists out of idealism, but cynicism! We have seen the fruits of authoritarianism in the horrors of the North Zebrican War! Our rallying cry is simple - never again."
 HIP_anti_hierarchy_movement:0 "The Anti-Hierarchy Movement"
 HIP_anti_hierarchy_movement_desc:0 "Hierarchy is the placing of one life, one will, one culture above another.

 HIP_school_based_life:0 "Reintroduce School-Based Life"
 HIP_school_based_life_desc:0 "Before the invention of agriculture, seaponies lived in communal, non-hierarchical shoals.

 HIP_augmented_hunter_gatherers_desc:0 "In many parts of the world, hunter-gatherer society had problems, such as cultural conservatism, authority of the tribe leader, and feuds.

 HIP_expand_highwing_mines:0 "Expand the Highwing Mines"

 HIP_self_rule:0 "Institute Self-Rule"
 HIP_self_rule_desc:0 "It only makes sense to restore Zumidia to its own state. The Zumidian people deserve to have a ruler of their own. The only question remaining is to what extent we should grant them autonomy. A new conference at Wingnot should take care of that."

 HIP_north_zebrican_union:0 "The North Zebrican Union"
 HIP_north_zebrican_union_desc:0 "It is time to formalize our cooperation with Zumidia into a North Zebrican Union. Mutual protection, economic aid and free trade, and scientific collaboration between our peoples will ensure a harmonic bulwark against any foreign threats."

 HIP_withdraw_from_zebrica:0 "Withdrawal from Zebrica"
 HIP_withdraw_from_zebrica_desc:0 "As we learned from the Storm King's rampage, Zebrica is a dangerous place.

 HIP_CIV_grab_a_weapon:0 "Grab a Weapon"

 HIP_SIR_ready_the_masses:0 "Ready the Masses"
 HIP_SIR_ready_the_masses_desc:0 "The magic of my sisters and I are powerful, but it is clear that magic is not the only weapon is this world now.

 HIP_SIR_no_time_for_games:0 "No Time for Games"
 HIP_SIR_no_time_for_games_desc:0 "Factories are useful tools. They make what others want, and fuel the endless greed that drives creatures to the strife sirens consume. And yet we need them for other things, modern innovations like construction and excavation. Balance is not a word a siren knows well, but we will need to find it nonetheless to avoid a return to the abyss."
 HIP_SIR_an_army_of_our_own:0 "An Army of our Own"
 HIP_SIR_an_army_of_our_own_desc:0 "Conquest requires an army to enforce it. Whereas once the world was backwards, a time where my powers stronger than any mortal, now technology poses a threat to even myself and my fellow sirens.

 HIP_SIR_seize_the_factories:0 ""Seize" the Factories"
 HIP_SIR_seize_the_factories_desc:0 "Other "leaders" in this world do things like nationalize factories, taking them for usage by their "state" instead of private industries. I, as a siren do not have to deal with such trouble. Why would I, when the hippogriffs running them already listen to my every command? It's just telling them to have them do what I want, when I want."
 HIP_SIR_taking_what_we_have:0 "Taking What we Have"
 HIP_SIR_taking_what_we_have_desc:0 "Steel. Aluminum. Rubber. Resources critical to the creation of any army. We must use everything we have to our advantage, so I must send hippogriffs to find more of what we need. Adagio might be interested in these magical crystals under Mount Aris too..."

 HIP_SIR_defending_what_matters_desc:0 "There is only one thing that matters here anymore. My survival. Mine, and my fellow sirens. Everything else is secondary.

 HIP_SIR_the_means_of_production:0 "The Means of Production"
 HIP_SIR_the_means_of_production_desc:0 "Weapons are no longer made by craftsmen and blacksmiths in forges, but by ordinary creatures lined up in factories. Normally places like these would be ideal for sowing discord, but in this case I need every factory working for the future.

 HIP_SIR_those_who_fight_for_us:0 "Those who Fight for Us"
 HIP_SIR_those_who_fight_for_us_desc:0 "A modern army is built on discipline, order and the "chain of command". All traits that for sirens are practically unheard of. But an army that fights itself is bound to collapse, so it seems I will need to keep our soldiers on a tighter leash..."
 HIP_SIR_last_minute_preparations:0 "Last Minute Preparations"
 HIP_SIR_last_minute_preparations_desc:0 "Most of these nation-states that now live on this world have forced that have years of experience in war.

 HIP_SIR_the_sound_of_our_voice:0 "The Sound of Our Voice"
 HIP_SIR_the_sound_of_our_voice_desc:0 "A voice is a siren's very being, the core of who they are and what they do. And with it comes a certain inherent right, that to rule over those lower than one's self. Hippogriffia was a start, but this small island is in no way the end of my plans... the rest will just take time."
 HIP_SIR_the_siren_constant:0 "The Siren Constant"
 HIP_SIR_the_siren_constant_desc:0 "Having to manage every single affair on this island is tiring, and ultimately a waste of ability. But keeping one to absolute loyalty usually has negative effects on their capability to manage said affairs. What I need is someone new, someone else who can deal with the trivial issues in my stead, while being loyal without a song or magic."
 HIP_SIR_what_comes_after:0 "What Comes After"
 HIP_SIR_what_comes_after_desc:0 "In shortsighted foolishness, many creatures choose to take up arms and fruitlessly fight against me, even after my victory. My conquests will not end in peace, nor will they resolve over time. A siren's voice will pacify the crowds, but true stability will only come with effort."
 HIP_SIR_repurpose_the_AHAC:0 "Repurpose the AHAC"
 HIP_SIR_repurpose_the_AHAC_desc:0 "My collaborator has already gone to work in my name, and has come with a curious request. He wishes to supplant the organization the hippogriffs once called the Anti-Harmonic Activities Committee, and replace it with his own group more aligned with his, and by extension my interests. I see no reason why I should not give him what he wants, as long as it has results."
 HIP_SIR_spread_the_song:0 "Spread the Song"
 HIP_SIR_spread_the_song_desc:0 "It only takes one listen to my voice for the magic to do its work, but once is never enough to truly appreciate such a gift. Use the radios, spread the music, let all hear the songs I sing all the time, to keep them in line and give me the adoration I deserve."
 HIP_SIR_utilize_the_seaponies:0 "Utilize the Seaponies"
 HIP_SIR_utilize_the_seaponies_desc:0 "The underwater realm I and the others used as a springboard to take the island still has its uses if used well. With us in control of the so-called Pearl of Transformation and its shards, we by extension control all access to and from the deeps, and building in a place no one else can reach may prove beneficial in time."
 HIP_SIR_all_to_the_surface:0 "All to the Surface"
 HIP_SIR_all_to_the_surface_desc:0 "Now that it has served its purpose, the realm beneath the waves and the seaponies that live there serve no more use to me, at least in their current forms. They are needed on the surface, where they can gain a true purpose, just like the rest of the hippogriffs. Abandon the seas, and take your place in the world that belongs to me."

 HIP_nuclear_depth_charges:0 "Project BOTTOMFEEDER"

 ### EVENTS ###
 hippogriff.1.t: "Hurricane!"
 hippogriff.1.d: "A devastating hurricane with sustained winds over 220 kilometres per hour slammed into Hippogriffia from Warzena and Chiropterra, with the heaviest damage done to East Aris. Although our ability to shift between hippogriffs and seaponies let us avoid any deaths due to flooding, it provided no protection against the trees hurled through the air or the gusts slamming us into walls.

The economic impact of this disaster cannot yet be calculated, and many seaponies are using it as an evidence that the surface is too dangerous."

 hippogriff.100.t:0 "Zumidian Tank Trials"
 hippogriff.100.desc:0 "Over the past few weeks, the army has been trialling various proposals for tank designs in Zumidia. After our victory over the Storm King, the army searched for the latest advances in land warfare from around the world. Of particular interest was Stalliongrad's use of tanks during their revolution. Royal Island Arsenal has been hard at work developing a series of proposed tank designs and experimenting with how best to integrate them into our land forces. The original T1 prototype was scrapped early in development, but the T2 and T3 prototypes are looking promising.\n\nThe T2 is a small and fast light tank with a crew of four. It has 16mm of armour and a max speed of 72 km/h on roads. The T3, however, is the exact opposite. A joint collaboration with Equestria, the T3 is designed with a crew of ten and has a maximum speed of 10 km/h over roads. With seven guns, it is built to overwhelm the enemy with superior firepower as it advances with the infantry, rather than outmanoeuvring the enemy lines.\n\nA third contestant had also entered the trials; Cross Tide, an eccentric inventor and racing car driver, submitted his own design based purely on speed. While more lightly armoured than either the T2 or T3, Tide's tank supports a crew of two, it is armed with a 37mm cannon, and has an astonishing speed of 120 km/h on roads. However, army analysts are not confident that it could stand up to any form of anti-tank weapons that it would be liable to face.\n\nAs the trials conclude, a decision must be taken. Which design will the army adopt?"
 hippogriff.100.a:0 "The light tank should be our focus."

 hipflavour.1.desc:0 "Ever since we exposed ourselves to the outside world after our long sequester in Seaquestria, foreign products have been coming into Hippogriffia. Perhaps the most important of these are books, and the ideas they hold. From works of literature to science to philosophy, our younger generation are voraciously devouring this new reading material, and as they do so, they pick up some of these ideas and make them their own. Of greatest concern to us are the political ideas they have been absorbing: while Hippogriffia has always been a stable absolute monarchy, many among the younger generation are now discovering that there are other ways of organizing society, ranging from constitutionalism to republicanism to nationalism to even the most radical ideas, such as fascism and communism. Right now their curiosity is intellectual, but we know how fast these intellectual ideas can take hold, and the threat they could eventually pose to our rule."

Clubs have formed discussing and spreading these ideas, which range from liberal ideas of free trade and representative government inspired by the Griffonian "three principles" to more radical ones, with some of these clubs even forming up around communist ideas imported from Stalliongrad, although none have yet called for anything like a revolution. Most of the membership of these clubs consist of curious young griffs prone to experimentation, as well as a few older ones who are dissatisfied with the monarchy and its handling of the Storm King's invasion."

 hipflavour.3.desc:0 "A group of veterans, protectionist economists, and community activists gathered together today to announce the formation of the Aris First Committee, a group "Dedicated to preserving traditional Hippogriffian values and protecting our economy from foreign takeover." The most prominent leaders were seapony Raft Wood, the Queen's former advisor who had first proposed the move to Seaquestria, and hippogriff flying ace Crack Lightning, who gave a patriotic speech at the opening of the committee:\n\n"Mt. Aris stands tall, and like the mountain we must stand alone. We cannot depend on foreigners to help us, and neither should they depend on us. We have always been strong, self-sufficient, and proud of our cultures and traditions, and the Aris First committee will see that that stays true into the 11th century and beyond."\nHe was met with thunderous applause, and launched into the second half of his speech with even more vigor: "Liberal intellectuals would have us believe that harmony means opening our markets and our borders to everycreature, or funneling money and resources into charity projects in the North Zebrican Mandate. I believe harmony means a well-ordered, self-sufficient society that looks after its own. Aris First stands for the auto worker who is tired of seeing foreign cars drive their wages down, for the veteran tired of zebras accusing us of cowardice when we defeated the Storm King, for the small business owner tired of competing with foreign conglomerates who cheat the market. More than that, Aris first stands for our culture, our values, our history, and for a bright future for all Hippogriffia!"\n\nMany newspapers have denounced Aris First as xenophobic, backwards, or fearmongering. Still, their membership is quickly swelling, particularly in Seaquestria where seaponies see very little to gain from international trade, as there are few foreign products they want and many are concerned about underwater manufacturing being unable to compete with industrial giants in Equestria and Griffonia."

 hipflavour.4.banned.desc:0 "Banning the socialist book clubs has not eliminated these ideas, it seems. Reports trickle in daily of these clubs organizing in the nooks and crannies of Seaquestria, and of more and more of our citizens gravitating towards this enticing "forbidden knowledge." From what little information we have on these meetings, their disdain for the government has grown since we banned them, and while they once talked of abstract ideals, they have now become more like conspiratorial groups plotting revolution.\n\nAmong the seaponies, the largest of these underground groups are anarchists, who who call for a complete abolition of the state and claim to represent the "natural way of life of the seaponies," advocating for democratic non-hierarchical school-based living. Meanwhile, the most popular group among hippogriffs is a communist faction which emerged around a charismatic and eccentric seapony named Posada, who claims that Hippogriffia is uniquely suited to achieving "a post-scarcity society" but only if it is revolutionized into a dictatorship of the proletariat.\n\nRecently, we have received a tipoff that the anarchists and communists are planning a conference to debate their ideas and form a coalition, presumably with the aim of combining their forces for some plot against the government."
 hipflavour.4.desc:0 "The socialist book clubs have begun spreading outside the universities, as idealistic students try to spread their ideas among the general populace. While many of these groups profess "harmonic socialist" and "democratic socialist" ideals and want to work with the government to implement socialist economics in Hippogriffia, there is an undercurrent of sedition in these groups, as they all want at least as much devolution of power away from the monarchy as the liberals do.\n\nMore alarmingly, some of these groups openly call for the complete transformation of Hippogriffia. These more radical groups are gaining popularity among the poorer seaponies and hippogriffs who are skeptical of the possibility of reform. The largest of these radicals among the seaponies are anarchists, who call for a complete abolition of the state and claim to represent the "natural way of life of the seaponies," advocating for democratic non-hierarchical school-based living. Meanwhile, the most popular group among hippogriffs is a communist faction which emerged around a charismatic and eccentric seapony named Posada, who claims that Hippogriffia is uniquely suited to achieving a "post-scarcity society" but only if it is transformed into a revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat. Although Posada has expressed a willingness to work with the monarchy, there is little doubt that like the anarchists, her calls to revolution are very literal.\n\nWhile these groups are currently fairly small, their membership is rapidly growing, and news has reached us that they are planning a conference to debate their ideas and form a coalition of some kind, presumably organized around whichever faction's ideas prove most persuasive."

His three-month solo tour of the world has been the talk of Hippogriffia, with many wondering what he'd discover beyond the borders of the island. His words to a reporter from Aris Post have been reprinted in numerous outlets, and his celebrity has turned them into a rallying cry for the isolationist elements within Hippogriffia:\n\n"There are many great sights in the wider world, Karthin chief among them, but I must say on the whole, the Storm King's barbarism is the rule rather than the exception outside of our fair nation. They have very little to offer us except for endless 'isms': communism, liberalism, republicanism, all ideas which griffons and even ponies kill each other over every day.

The Director was quite sympathetic to their case, as ever since they opened up their country they have been inundated with fascist, communist and other anti-harmonic radicals trying to spread their ideologies and undermine one of the few harmonist states in North Zebrica.\n\nThey requested we share our experience combatting communist influence in Rijekograd, as well as conduct joint training exercises for their agents to better prepare them to nip subversive activity in the bud.

Director Bon Bon is entusiastic about this plan, saying that it is just as important to protect harmony in Hippogriffia as it is in Equestria, but Princess Twilight Sparkle has expressed some reservations.

However good the intentions behind it, the AHAC's activities undermine that trust. Therefore, [EQS.GetLeader] has regretfully declined your request to share intelligence between SMILE and the Anti-Harmonic Activities Committee."\n\nThis comes as a great disappointment to the AHAC, whose chairgriff expected our friends in Equestria to enthusiastically support our fight against extremism in Hippogriffia."

They cite Wingbardy as "a hotbed of socialist and fascist radicalism," paying particular attention to the doctrines of Beakolini and the way supposedly-apolitical Wingbardian literature subtly advances fascist ideology.\n\nThis move has been met with condemnation from a singularly unexpected source: while Raft Wood and most of the rest of Aris First have praised the move as "the first step in freeing our culture from foreign influence," Crack Lightning has criticized the ban, arguing that Wingbardian books are no more dangerous than any other, that the ban is poorly worded, and that it rests on an idea of so-called "Crypto-fascism" which he finds preposterous. His voice is joined by the usual choir of progressive harmonists who oppose the AHAC, with Silverstream and Skystar both urging Queen Novo to rein in the AHAC, seeing the ban as yet another example of an escalating trend of xenophobia within the committee, with Skystar being particularly passionate about not wanting to go back to the lonely days of hiding from the world."

Meanwhile, the Aris First movement largely endorsed the move, with Raft Wood proclaiming his full confidence in Violet Facade's judgement and expertise. Queen Novo decided to at least give it a read before making a decision. The report addressed each Element of Harmony in turn:\n\nLoyalty, contrary to the Equestrian understanding, was about pride in your home and loyalty to the Queen and Hippogriffian Harmony itself, not about your personal friends.\nHonesty is more than telling the truth. It was also about behaving in an upright and correct manner for your station.\nGenerosity is when well-off creatures willingly used their wealth to help their country and those less fortunate, and is thus incompatible with forced wealth redistribution.\nMagic is not only magic, but the pursuit of excellence in all of one's talents.\nLaughter and Kindness, being altogether too vague to be given a rigorous legal definition, should be considered secondary Elements.\n\nThe report concluded that under the definition, Hippogriffia should stop looking to Equestria and especially to Griffonian republicans, liberals, social democrats, and other false-Harmonists for guidance, as these were all either too laissez-faire, too individualistic, or too focused on anti-harmonic notions of constitutionalism or economic redistribution to truly understand Harmony as we do.\n\nNovo set the report down, declaring:"

Posada had already gotten the Supreme Workers' Council's authorization to deal with them, and there would be no half-measures. Next to the orders which would end these twelve lives was a letter, written by her old friend Crack Lightning.

The presidium had been endlessly debating what to do with the Chiropterran occupation zone, with the proposals getting more and more desperate as new facts about Chiropterra came to light. This was a society engineered from the ground up for a thousand years to be as ruthless as possible, arranged in a vast stratocracy. Given their crimes and the depth of their hatred for their occupiers, incorporating Chiropterra as an ordinary administrative region was out of the question. Whichever option was adopted, it would take generations to fully uproot the Chiropterran system, which had taken root in the minds of every Chiropterran citizen even with their government gone. Three proposals lay before the presidium, each sickening in its own way.\nThe first would represent a concession to absolute evil. There were two Chiropterran Moonspeakers, two out of the entire country, who had somehow twisted the Nightmarist faith into something resembling liberation theology. Posada could withdraw the majority of the occupation force and put these two in charge, although in order to administer Chiropterra they would have to use much of the old power structure, which meant letting war criminals return to their old jobs and potentially setting Chiropterra up to rise again and exact revenge.\nThe second proposal would mean remaining in the Chiropterran quagmire for generations. The creatures of Chiropterra would be mostly spared death, but the Nightmarist faith would be completely banned, even in its most casual incarnations, and the entire population of Chiropterra would have to attend reeducation camps, where the next generation would learn of the evils of the Chiropterran system so that they might grow up better than their parents. This was guaranteed to be met with massive resistance and endless insurgencies, but its proponents argued that the first plan was naive and the third plan monstrous.\nThe third option was genocide. Justice would be applied in its harshest form, with everyone above the rank of sergeant immediately shot. A blue terror of massive proportions would erase Chiropterra, with those who were not shot put into permanent reeducation camps. It was horrific, it was bloodier than even the Storm King's methods, but it would finally destroy one of the most evil nations in the world."

More controversial are the military applications of their research. While their combat drugs were undeniably effective, many of them were temperamental, and we only have a vague understanding of how they work since so many of their records were destroyed. Adopting these would mean turning our own soldiers into the lab rats of Chiropterra's worst, even from beyond the grave. Still, Terrafin and many others in our own military science division have urged us to put aside these qualms and use these military applications, as doing so would make our troops more effective and almost certainly save lives.\n\nFinally, an even more controversial option has been proposed: Chiropterran scientists advanced medical science immensely, and with the destruction of so many records, much of their data only exists in their heads. Certain technocratic elements have suggested that by offering amnesty to a mere half-dozen of Chiropterra's monsters, we could advance our own medical research dramatically.

 hippocommie.11.d_caseless:0 "Caseless ammunition has many benefits, including lightening the load carried by each soldier, but our chemists had difficulty creating a material that would both hold the bullet in place and act as a propellant while not being prohibitively difficult to manufacture.\n\nThe solution came from an unexpected source: a chemistry graduate student named Carlos Gonzalez, who was working as a lab assistant on the project, applied a bit of Zumidian alchemy to the problem and finally created a formula which worked. Terrafin has already named the first working caseless firearm the 'Gonzalez-pattern light machinegun.' Terrafin recommends the new ammunition be rolled out as soon as possible, since it halves the weight of ammunition and turns the weapon into a beautiful closed system with no ejection ports to allow dust in, and no material wasted. Full adoption will take years given the lack of backwards compatibility, but the 'Gonzalez' is already proving a hit with troops, especially ammunition carriers."

Such weapons are, so far, the only method of reliably delivering strategic nuclear weapons, despite the promise of ICBMs continuing to grow. But there are three competing proposals before the General Secretary's desk, and only one can be chosen.\n\nThe first proposal, lead by old Air Force generals, suggests strongly incentivizing the growth of strategic bombers through major research grants. These would largely stick to established wisdom and not risk major changes.\n\nThe second proposal offers experimental improvements to designs, focused around achieving more lift with bigger bomb bays at a greater range. Terrafin has signed his name to this project, believing it is likely to succeed and will prove highly valuable.\n\nThe third proposal argues that enemy interception technology is too advanced and a totally new design is required to stab into the heart of enemy airspace. By flying higher than enemy interceptors can reach at Mach 3, it will be able to deliver nuclear payloads with safety anywhere. This so-called "deep-penetration bomber" would likely prove massively expensive and fuel-hungry, but proponents argue such costs are well worth it."

The RWP-A is also likely to advocate for more moderate foreign policy than Posada's, as they primarily consist of seaponies who still tend to be more isolationist than the fervent internationalists who make up the majority of the RWP, and see far less to gain from military intervention."

While few took the nationalist's word for it, he protested that "Beakolini himself went from being a socialist to being a nationalist, so why can't I do the opposite?"\nEven with his alleged conversion, the former Aris First members who make up these prospective "National Communists" have voiced their opposition to the mainstream RWP's internationalism, arguing that other races and societies are too backwards to achieve communism in a "civilized manner" as we have, and arguing that we owe nothing to such inferior civilizations, and should seek to protect ourselves from them rather than "Pursue some romantic dream of international proletarian solidarity.""

When Hard Line got up to speak, Posada knew there would be trouble.\n\n"Esteemed comrades," he began, "We must address a mistake which I believe this body made during the confusion of the early revolution, but which can be corrected if we act swiftly. We can hardly say that we are sweeping aside the old world if we allow not only capitalists but the royalty themselves to swim among us. We allowed rightist temerity to win out that day, and so I move to reopen the issue of Queen Novo, and suggest we follow what every successful revolution has done and have the primary symbol of reaction in Revolutionary North Zebrica executed immediately."\n\nPosada glanced at Skystar, noticing the young commissar had started to cry even as Hard Line was met with boos and hisses by most of the Workers' Council. Posada had to shut this down at once, and addressed him from across the room:\n\n"Comrades, please! Do not boo him, engage with him. Now, remember Caramel Marks said that it is a sign of weakness of a people to hold their enemy at their mercy and not exact revenge."\n\n"Exactly General Secretary, it was a moment of weakness-"\n\n"Wait!" interrupted Posada, "I am so sorry, esteemed comrades, that wasn't Caramel Marks, that was Beakolini." She heard a tiny giggle coming from Skystar, and continued, launching into a tirade at the momentarily dumbstruck Hard Line: "This body already made its decision, and it was in a moment of courage and clarity, not 'rightist cowardice.' The issue is closed.

As she returned to her little home, her foals Agave Dew and Guava Drop ran out, babbling something about a radio announcement.

The message she was greeted with was nothing she had expected.\n\n"My friends," came the voice of the infamous radical Moonspeaker Dusk Wane, "It is time for us to leave our mistakes behind us. I have spoken with the communist leaders, and they have agreed to withdraw their forces and provide amnesty for those still fighting in the hills, so long as we accept our crimes and move forward to build a better Chiropterra."\n\nGuava Drop hissed, but Silver Spike shushed him. She'd always been at least slightly sympathetic to Dusk Wane's message, even if he did border on heresy.\n\n"We have been lost, my friends, for a very long time. I have been to old Tzinacatlia; our true faith is one of sharing, and tolerance of difference. Nightmare Moon shelters all, her light shines upon all, but we have been blinded by grief at our defeat and allowed bitterness to twist us for a thousand years. So I implore you, walk with me, walk with the hippogriffs, into a brighter future free of the poison of hatred."\n\nShe knew she should be outraged at the blatant heresy, but mostly she just felt relieved that the occupation was going to end and Night Eye would be able to come home.

He would be reunited with Silver Spike and their foals in their minimum-security facility in eighteen months, conditional on his and their good behavior.\n\nGuava Drop bowed his head and mouthed a thank you to Nightmare Moon for their food, just like Silver Spike had raised him to.\n"Stop that," she whispered, "If they see you..."\n"But you said," her youngest foal said, "You said as long as we didn't say anything, they wouldn't-"\n"They've gotten better at spotting things. We can't ever break the rules, do you understand?"\n"Will they punish us?" her older foal asked.\n"Yes Guava."\n"I can take it!" Guava Drop declared, "Let them punish us!"\n"Hush! It's not just us anymore. They got dad. He's alright right now, but we'll only be able to see him again if we're on our best behavior. You want to see dad again, right?"\n\nHer foals nodded. Silver Spike silently cursed herself for becoming an instrument of the communists' ploys to wipe out her faith, and she hoped Nightmare Moon would forgive her. But what else could she do?

There were four of them, all armed, three of them pointing guns at her while the fourth addressed her from behind a clipboard.\n"That's me, yes."\n"Right. Your husband Night Eye was recently identified in a raid on a terrorist holdout. As you did not come forward with information on him, you are considered an accomplice in his actions, which caused the death of three Blue Army soldiers."\nSilently, Silver Spike congratulated her husband. A fever had prevented her from joining him before the communists had locked down their village, but she was proud of him for making these invaders bleed.\n"Furthermore," the communist continued, "As a second lieutenant in the Ursa Legion, you are considered complicit in the innumerable crimes of Chiropterra, and are therefore scheduled for liquidation."\n\nSilver Spike stiffened. She knew death would come for her, and was ready to face it with dignity. Then she heard Guava Drop whimpering, and glanced behind her to see that her foals had disobeyed her and come out of hiding. All of her strength vanished.\n\n"What about my foals?" she whispered to the hippogriffs, "Will they be taken care of? Will they be alright?"\n"If they behave."\nSilver Spike nodded, and kneeled down to talk to her foals one last time.\n"You be good, okay?" she said, "Agave, you watch after your brother. Do whatever the hippogriffs tell you to, and... don't look for me."\n\nSilver Spike turned to face the hippogriffs, and followed them out into the woods around her village."

Still, she would never forget Aquila's sights and splendors, and she intended to keep her promise to her guide to write to him as soon as she returned to Seaquestria.\n\nWhile her official business had been to foster ties between Revolutionary North Zebrica and their comrades on Griffonia, she had spent most of her time not with the dull president of the Aquileian Republic but with one of his associates: the delightfully-mad Victor Allard. Victor had shown her all around the city, and they'd stayed into the small hours every night discussing their dreams, ambitions, and the peculiar kinds of Marksist theories they each subscribed to. Victor was one of the few creatures Posada had met who could keep up with her on that front. Whether dining at one of the many fine restaurants in Aquila, wandering the parks and boulevards of the capital or in Victor's living room, there was never a dull moment with him.\n\nPosada chuckled at the crazy request she'd made on her last day in Aquila, asking him to come with her to North Zebrica. "Your zeal is wasted here!" she'd exclaimed, "The rest of the PAT are so boring; you'd fit in so much better in North Zebrica. We could really use somegriff with a mind like yours!"\nHe'd just given that sardonic grin she'd grown to enjoy so much, and told her that he could never abandon his beloved city, then slyly said not to underestimate [JER.GetLeader] and what the PAT could do.

Your achievements in Hippogriffia are admirable, as is the way you have addressed the Zumidian zebras as your comrades, rather than your subjects. However, I cannot allow you to continue in your current path, and I hope by the time you have read this letter you will see why.\n\nYou have always spoken against imperialism, but while your presses spill rivers of ink rightly condemning it, your armies prepare to spill rivers of blood to bend the nations of North Zebrica to your will. Do you not see the contradiction? I have praised your state and its achievements, but the culture, the history, and thus the destiny of Hippogriffia is not that of Zarantia, Warzena, Chiropterra, or indeed of Zumidia or Zonicia. And so as one idealist to another, I would like to offer you an alternative vision.\n\nLet us work together, as a commonwealth of independent nations, supporting each other in developing their own unique forms of harmonious life. I ask that we combine our resources to rebuild the nations of this region devastated by this era of war, and then to walk with them in friendship rather than ruling over them in a vast super-state.\n\nI understand that our visions are very different, and that they may seem totally incompatible even, but I trust you will see the wisdom in these words and abandon your current ambitions in favour of something which trusts the creatures of other nations to determine their own destinies.\n\nSincerely,\n-Zeshunamash Zeirutid."\n\nPosada set down the letter, her claws shaking slightly after the third re-read.

Waving flags or photographs of Queen Novo, the Aris First supporters cheered and chanted their patriotism in a rowdy display. When their leader Raft Wood got up on the stage, the cheers grew even louder, quickly turning to boos as he told of the latest insults coming from the zebras.\n\n"Cowards, they call us!" he exclaimed to the crowd, "I have it right here, from the mouth of a political chief in Colthage: 'the Hippogriffs boast of their victory over the Storm King, as though fighting a single lucky battle after years of hiding can compare to the grueling campaigns we zebras fought against him all across the continent.' We save them, and this is how they treat us. And then they come to the Zumidian refugee zone and exploit our generosity. No more I say! Queen Novo was right to retreat to Seaquestria, she was right to emerge when she did, and we shall suffer no further slander to our people or our queen!"\n\nThe crowd's cheers were joined by the sound of propellers, as Crack Lightning made a flyover in the Spirit of Starfield, the custom fighter plane he had shot down one of the Storm King's mighty airships with.

 arisfirst.4.desc:0 "The "Clothing Debate" has come to a head, with Aris First and their opponents both demanding that Queen Novo take a solid position on the issue of foreign clothing in Hippogriffia. Raft Wood has presented a petition with thousands of signatures demanding that government workers only be allowed to wear clothing made in Hippogriffia, claiming that the influx of foreign clothing "Dilutes our identity and damages our economy, leading to unrest and poverty."\nThe petitioners claim that having government employees wear foreign clothing at work sends a particularly bad message, because as servants of the crown they are also representatives of Hippogriffia. It spreads the idea that foreign nations produce better cultural products than our own, which damages national unity.\n\nHardliners within Aris first have demanded the government go even further, pointing to the lax labour laws and lower quality control standards in Griffonia and arguing that "greedy griffons" would still find ways to undercut and eventually destroy the Aris clothing industry even with Raft Wood's proposed ban.\n\nMore liberal voices have denounced the whole issue as "a silly affair" and have argued that no Harmonist government should pass laws mandating what its citizens wear, as doing so is an unacceptable breach of personal liberty. They've also argued that competition breeds innovation, and that the exchange of fashion between Hippogriffia and other nations has caused new and exciting fashion trends to develop, which would be stifled by the government issuing bans. Notably, Princess Skystar and Silverstream have come out against the proposed bans, saying that Hippogriffia should be friendly towards other nations, with Silverstream pointing to the griffon and pony friends she made in Equestria as reasons why Hippogriffs don't need to be afraid of other creatures."

Aris First has always stood for isolationism, for putting our own interests ahead of foreign ones, but Crack Lightning and his hardliners, particularly his ridiculous 'Phalanx,' want us to destroy our own traditions in the name of, and I cannot believe I am saying this..."\n\nRaft Wood took a pause, swimming about anxiously and checking for the fifth time if the room was bugged. He was the one who was supposed to know if someone was being watched, but with his allies turning against him he couldn't be too careful.\n\n"The vile Wingbardian ideology of fascism," he concluded. "Many of you have worked with the AHAC, and know that fascism is against our way of life. Rather than withdrawing us from Zebrica, Crack Lightning would see us become even more entangled in it. Worse yet, fascism requires one supreme leader, which means he undoubtedly plans to sideline and eliminate both Queen Novo and, well, me."\n\nRaft Wood let his statement sink in, reading the room for a moment. The signs had always been there, but it felt odd to say out loud that the charismatic hippogriff which had carried his movement to power now sought to remove Raft Wood from the picture.\n\n"The hardliners control the military, the Phalanx, and a significant portion of Aris First. Since we are only now becoming aware of the threat, we have to assume they are several steps ahead of us. We have the AHAC, the intelligence agencies, and the police, plus the fact that very few hippogriffs want to live in a fascist state. We will have to act quickly, yet subtly. Prevent him from raising the jingoistic fervour of the masses to a high enough pitch that they demand we go to war, watch the military for the signs of a coup d'etat, and remove his influence from Aris First. While we're doing that, I will arrange secret AHAC meetings to build a case to arrest him. If we act too brashly, his supporters will hang us in the streets. Too timidly, and he'll have us all shot. I trust you all to know what to do when the time comes.""

Lucky Break was nowhere to be found, but the protestor's leader Raft Wood told reporters that his followers would not leave until Lucky Break promised to stop buying Wingbardian and New Marelander automobiles.\n\n"It's a disgrace!" he exclaimed, "Lucky Break knows we produce perfectly good cars here, and yet she insists on bringing in products from halfway across the world, damaging our economy and putting more and more of these foreign deathtraps on the road.

Aris First leader Raft Wood, who was once high in Novo's court, has appealed this rejection directly to the Queen, an act unheard of until now, requesting that she overturn the mayor's decision and allow their peaceful gathering to go ahead. Wood said in a heartfelt letter that Aris First has always stood in support of the monarch, and merely wishes to make their message known in a location so in tune with the traditions of the nation they hold dear. As well as assuring her that he and Crack Lightning had already put plans in place to ensure the rally did not ruin the scenery. Finally, he also argued that the mayor's decision was motivated by anti-Aris First bias and pre-existing political agendas against him, and that any other Arisian would allow him to hold the rally.\n\nWhile there is nothing truly illegal about the attempted rally, the concerns of the Mayor are valid, and allowing this petition to be received by the Queen could be a show of official support from the monarch."

Raft Wood wanted to continue the AHAC's policies of acting primarily as protection against actual extremists, while Lightning wanted to use it to perscute alleged "objective enemies" and enforce some vague but extremely-high standard of loyalty which he had yet to properly explain. When Raft had expressed concern about the growing militancy of Crack's Phalanx, Crack had dismissed it out of claw. While they both wanted to promote harmony among classes, Lightning's proposal on how to do so required major economic restructuring in what he called a "Solidarist economic revolution," massively overturning Aris' economic system for the sake of what he called a national reforging. Most worryingly, Crack Lightning was speaking of foreign powers as if a final war with them was inevitable, and arguing Hippogriffia should strike first.\n\nAfter Crack left, Raft closed his eyes, letting his colleague's proposals stew in his mind. Everything was somehow off. He'd felt it ever since the Phalanx formed, ever since Aris First had adopted the "One Mountain, One People, One Will" slogan.

The attempts to limit the patriotic activities of the Phalanx, whose soldiers only wanted to stop foreigners from destroying Hippogriffia. Which foreign power did Raft Wood conspire with?

Her righteous rage when she'd seen Silverstream on the list had reminded Raft Wood why he'd always been loyal to her.\n\nStill, Raft Wood was uneasy. And it wasn't just the war. Crack Lightning had been the ideological thought leader between the two; Raft Wood had just followed his gut instincts and vague feelings that Hippogriffia needed to be protected against foreign influence.

Had his own thoughts been twisted away from Harmony by Lightning's venom?\n\nHe wouldn't embrace the progressives wholesale; the very thought of making Hippogriffia into a second-rate Equestria revolted him, to say nothing of the republicans and the socialists and all those other foreign ideologies.

And yet, despite our best efforts we have been unable to discern their intention, or even what kind of threat they may pose to both seaponies and hippogriffs. What we do know is that they are rapidly growing in number, and while currently constrained beneath the waves some on Mount Aris are afraid that it may spread to the mainland.\n\nEven more worrying is that evidence points to the seaponies sent to the Mareiana Trench as responsible for starting the societies, and we have been unable to find them since only a few short weeks after their return. Fearful whispers speak of a plot growing against Hippogriffia itself, but for now they remained consigned to just that; rumors. All we can do at the moment is wait and see what these societies will do."
 hippogriff_abyss.2.a:0 "Let us hope that the situation does not escalate..."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.3.t:0 "Breakdown of Order"
 hippogriff_abyss.3.d:0 "Just as we feared, the situation has escalated in Seaquestria. Only a few days ago, violence broke out all across the underwater realm, plunging large parts of it into chaos. Small feuds that normally would be resolved with simple words, like running into one another and different tastes in music have all incited physical assaults, seapony fighting seapony until broken up by others. The societies were our initial suspects, but it seems that the phenomenon has affected even them as some in their ranks were sighted engaging in blows. The rest continue to meet in secluded places, unhindered by the crisis.\n\nNo matter the cause, the situation is untenable and something must now be done. A possible solution would be to send in more hippogriff soldiers underwater to enforce peace until the seaponies regain their wits. While it would prove immensely unpopular with some and may take a while, we would at least minimize the damage and spread of the violent outbreak.\n\nAnother option proposed by the cabinet is to seek help from Equestria and the Elements of Harmony. Foul magic seems to be at play here, and the ponies have aided us before in our time of need. With their help, whatever is causing this will surely be caught and order restored quickly, as long as the Equestrians actually agree to help.\n\nOf course, we could also always just wait out the chaos and hope that the seaponies regain their sanity on their own."
 hippogriff_abyss.3.a:0 "We can deal with this ourselves."
 hippogriff_abyss.3.b:0 "The Elements saved us once; we must ask for their aid again."
 hippogriff_abyss.3.c:0 "This chaos is simply temporary, we just have to wait it out."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.4.t:0 "Seaquestrian Order Restored"
 hippogriff_abyss.4.d:0 "After many painstaking months of work by our forces, Seaquestria has finally recovered from its brief period of chaos and the seaponies have returned to their normal friendly state. The initial weeks were the hardest, as at first those affected were incredibly difficult to subdue, constantly struggling and fighting if a single other seapony was nearby. Only isolated did they become docile. This tactic, although slow was used throughout all of Seaquestria, ensuring peace bit by bit. Fortunately, whatever seemed to be possessing them weakened the further we progressed.\n\nThe hidden societies did cause some trouble initially as well, attempting to stop our forces from interferring in the violence. They too were subdued, and after order was completely restored they seem to have regained their senses as well. All of them have disbanded, though just as before when questioned they stated that they had no memory of the meetings or of what was discussed.\n\nWhat caused this terrible incident we may never know, but at least it is over. The Mareiana Trench has also been put on an indefinite ban of travel for the time being."
 hippogriff_abyss.4.a:0 "At least we got that finally sorted."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.5.t:0 "A Plea from Hippogriffia"
 hippogriff_abyss.5.d:0 "Trouble seems to be stirring in Zebrica, for a recent message has arrived from our old friends in Hippogriffia. Seeming to be in a rush, the hippogriff hurriedly explained that Seaquestria has fallen into chaos, and that the aid of the Elements of Harmony were needed. Believing that dark magic was behind it, they hope that as friends the Element Bearers will agree to travel back to Mount Aris temporarily and restore order to the aquatic realm.\n\nThere is no doubt that if asked, Princess Twilight and her friends will agree to help the hippogriffs once more. The question is whether we can afford to send them at the moment. The world is only growing more turbulent, and it is quite possible that we need the Elements here and now. However, denying expected help would sour relations with our old friends, and could result in further chaos in Hippogriffia."
 hippogriff_abyss.5.a:0 "Of course we will help, assemble the Elements!"
 hippogriff_abyss.5.b:0 "Sorry, but we need them here and now."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.6.t:0 "A Quick Wrap-up"
 hippogriff_abyss.6.d:0 ""So the freed cultists have no memory of what started it? No information? Nothing?"\n"I'm afraid so, Queen Novo," replied Twilight Sparkle, "Only fragments of dreams. Once we used the Elements to stop the music, there was nothing left of whatever strange instruments the cultists were playing, and none of them even remembered what they were doing in the last month, or how they got there. I wish we had more to go off of, but we just don't have enough data."\n"It's a terrible shame we couldn't stay here longer," commented Rarity, "I do so love my seapony form, and by the sound of it Skystar and Pinkie have just gotten started on their reunion party."\n"You can feel free to stay a little longer. I'm just glad it's over without too many of us getting hurt. I'm honestly not sure what we would have done without you."\n"Oh it's nothing, really! You're our friends, and besides it was your idea to use a deafening spell before sending us in. Without that, we'd have been helpless against it."\n\nNovo sighed. "I do hate not knowing what almost destroyed my kingdom. But oh well, all's well that ends well. I'll have my magical researchers look over all the data we can find, and share it with you if anything comes up. In the meantime, let's join Pinkie and Skystar out there. It looks like half of Seaquestria's getting in on their party, so let's not miss it.""
 hippogriff_abyss.6.a:0 "We may not know what caused it, but at least it's behind us now."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.7.t:0 "The Equestrian Betrayal"
 hippogriff_abyss.7.d:0 "Terrible news! The Equestrians have, against our every hope and wish, decided not to send the Elements to aid us in our troubles in Seaquestria! We have not been made aware of the reasoning, but it seems highly unlikely that Princess Twilight herself decided not to aid us. More likely the Equestrian government simply ignored our calls for help for their own gain. This is a severe betrayal that we will not be forgetting anytime soon, but for now we have much more pressing matters to deal with.\n\nWith the Elements no longer an option, we are forced back to our original two ideas; either enforcing law and order in Seaquestria or doing nothing. The time spent wasted waiting on the Equestrian response has only worsened the situation, and no matter what we choose there will be repercussions across the nation. Word has already spread about the Equestrian debacle, and there are some calling us fools for ever relying on a foreign power."
 hippogriff_abyss.7.a:0 "Fine, we don't need their help to solve our problems."
 hippogriff_abyss.7.b:0 "Without the Elements we can do nothing..."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.8.t:0 "Peaceful Spread in [HIP_cult_gathering_state.GetName]"
 hippogriff_abyss.8.d:0 "The spread of our cult in [HIP_cult_gathering_state.GetName] was an absolute success, with members now spread all throughout the region. Conflict with non-members was at a minimum, and any confrontation with officials out of fear of our motives was quickly defused without escalation. The entire state is now securely under our influence, and our numbers have been bolstered by the new converts from the population."
 hippogriff_abyss.8.a:0 "The push towards control of Hippogriffia continues."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.9.t:0 "Minor Confrontation in [HIP_cult_gathering_state.GetName]"
 hippogriff_abyss.9.d:0 "Despite some minor conflicts and violence, the spread of our cult in [HIP_cult_gathering_state.GetName] was a success. While non-members did start minor fights with our own agents, they were relatively localized and contained. Some may still be afraid of our intentions and future actions, but for now the state is secure and our numbers grown."
 hippogriff_abyss.9.a:0 "Small roadbumps on the path towards victory."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.10.t:0 "Violent Outbreak in [HIP_cult_gathering_state.GetName]"
 hippogriff_abyss.10.d:0 "Unfortunately, our recent efforts to spread the cult in [HIP_cult_gathering_state.GetName] have been met with multiple outbreaks of fighting and violence. While our members were able to hold off the angry and terrified hippogriffs who had not yet joined us, the situation deteriorated to the point where the police had to intervene. The entire state is now on high alert, and though we have still expanded our numbers and have undercover control of the region, word has spread as the country drifts further towards instability and perhaps even open war against us."
 hippogriff_abyss.10.a:0 "Quite unfortunate, but our goal must stop for none."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.11.t:0 "Song of the Deep"
 hippogriff_abyss.11.d:0 "The capital had been taken hours ago. Fighting had been fierce and bloody, for while the cultists vastly outnumbered those still remaining, they did not have the weaponry or the skill that the royal guard of the palace did. But still, eventually numbers won out as our masses pushed forward endlessly, taking Mount Aris hall by hall, room by room. Each of our loyalists fought to their last breath, for our cause was great, greater than any other on Hippogriffia.\n\nThe throne room itself was the last holdout of resistance, but even that was overrun when the masses made a concentrated push at once. Queen Novo was captured relatively unharmed and is currently behind held captive, but unfortunately Princess Skystar is nowhere to be found. We believe she escaped long before our assault began, though where we are unsure of yet.\n\nBut that does not matter now. Nothing does, except what is to come. We have waited, waited for far too long for this moment. The doors open, and our masters float towards the throne we killed and died for, their tails and fins swishing in the open air. We all bow our heads to the floor. The teal one looks excited and giddy, while the pink one simply looks annoyed at the former. The yellow one just smirks, and by compulsion we rise once more, staring blankly as their three red gems inlaid in their chests glow.\n\nOur task is complete. Now, it is time for the whole world to hear their song as well."
 hippogriff_abyss.11.a:0 "Let the new age begin."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.12.t:0 "The Hippogriff Civil War"
 hippogriff_abyss.12.d:0 "With tensions continuously rising between cultist and loyalist, it was only a matter of time until it blew into the open. Unfortunately, that moment of time is now, as the government has declared us a danger to the Kingdom and started mass arrests. Now, we have no choice but to fight back, and with force. As the army is sent in, we have armed ourselves to prepare for the civil war.\n\nThe areas that we have already secured have already formed into makeshift divisions, but sources say that those loyal to Queen Novo have done the same. We can only hope now that our efforts beforehoof were enough to prevail now."
 hippogriff_abyss.12.a:0 "So it has come to this."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.13.t:0 "Song of the Deep"
 hippogriff_abyss.13.d:0 "What a waste. So many lives needlessly lost in a pointless war. So many voices made silent. This little conflict was nothing more than an annoyance, and yet it was necessary all the same. These mortals sought to undo our plan, one over a thousand years in the making, and had to be eliminated.\n\nOur servants did well, despite their foolish blunder in igniting open war. They were a useful tool, though still only a means to an end. Once the remaining hippogriffs surrendered, there was no more need of such zealotry, and so we dispelled our magic leaving them docile, yet no longer single-minded. They will fall in line with the rest of the mortals, serving a new purpose. Our purpose.\n\nWe have waited far too long for this. What has happened now is only a glimpse of what is to come, of what is our right. This world has become far too complacent, dividing themselves on trivial things such as ideologies or politics. We will offer them a new solution, a new chance to be part of something greater, serving us. Soon they'll find they don't have a choice.\n\nOur time is now, and their time is running out. Listen closely to our music...\n\n...For the show is about to start."
 hippogriff_abyss.13.a:0 "Let the new age begin."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.14.t:0 "The New World"
 hippogriff_abyss.14.d:0 "Change. It was quite obvious to Aria that the world was full of it. Even keeping in mind the fact that she was on an entire new continent now, barely anything was recognizable. What was once mere villages were now massive cities, what once took weeks to create now took hours, and magic... Adagio would never admit it, but Aria could see the writing on the wall. Their magic was no longer undefeatable, and it wasn't just that old fool Starswirl that proved that over a millennia ago. The weapons that creatures now possessed were dangerous, and they needed to be treated carefully.\n\n"There you are, Aria." The purple siren secretly rolled her eyes as the "leader" of the trio swam over. "Where have you been? Don't tell me you've been in Seaquestria with Sonata."\n\n"Of course not, Adagio. I'm getting this place ready for war."\n\nAdagio looked like she had seen Aria sprout a second head. "Excuse me? What are you talking about?"\n\nTurning, the purple siren kept her level, downright-bored disposition as she spoke. "We need an army, Adagio. We can't just go around and sing to the entire world. We're just going to get banished again, or worse. This world has new rules, new weapons, and we need them if we're going to go after our 'birthright' or whatever."\n\nAdagio sputtered for a bit before recovering. "Fine, just be ready to play your part when the time comes. I need to go find Sonata again and make sure she isn't blowing something up.""
 hippogriff_abyss.14.a:0 "It's time for us to change our tactics."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.15.t:0 "Destiny"
 hippogriff_abyss.15.d:0 "It was a disgrace. Truly, there was no better word to describe it. Over a thousand years, and the world had already all but forgotten about them. About her. They thought themselves more advanced just from their new toys, but Adagio could see through it all. Magic still ruled, magic always ruled, and she was the one who was supposed to rule with it.\n\nBut that was not what had happened. Her destiny, her birthright had been taken by fools, ponies who thought themselves above the natural order. Destiny, though, is only delayed, never stopped. They could not take away her voice, the gift of a true siren.\n\nThe time wasn't ready yet. There was still much to be done, more power to gain, more subjects to enthrall. Soon, however, she would make her triumphant return to Equestria. Her plans would come to fruition, with just a bit of patience.\n\nAnd Adagio was very good at that."
 hippogriff_abyss.15.a:0 "We bide our time until the opportunity arises."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.16.t:0 "Another Partner?"
 hippogriff_abyss.16.d:0 ""We need another member in our group."\n\nBoth Aria and Sonata looked up in surprise. "A fourth? You know we've never found another siren in all our lives, Adagio. What do you mean, 'another member'?" Aria asked, a bit of curiosity seeping into her normally flat tone.\n\nAdagio just rolled her eyes. "I wasn't talking about another siren. Doing everything ourselves is just wasting our time, and our voices. We need someone to do the dirty work for us, manage affairs while we look at the bigger picture."\n\nSonata perked up a bit before her expression quickly deflated. "But like, everyone here hates us! Who would even want to help without being under our spell?"\n\n"Sonata has a point," Aria agreed. "For once."\n\n"Yeah- hey!"\n\nAs the two devolved into yet another argument, Adagio looked out the window from the palace. The city of Mount Aris spread before her, the clueless hippogriffs walking and arguing in the streets. And further away, the factories continued to work, along with the housing where the wealthy elite still lived...\n\nAdagio smirked. Perhaps the world wasn't so different as it once was after all."
 hippogriff_abyss.16.a:0 ""I have an idea in mind...""
 
 hippogriff_abyss.17.t:0 "The Collaborator"
 hippogriff_abyss.17.d:0 "Plumage Moonfeather had faced many things in his life. Rival businessgriffs, workers, profit margins, and even the former Hippogriffian government. He knew how to play the game and how to play it well, and that was how he had thrived and become one of the richest birds on Aris.\n\nAnd yet, nothing could have possibly prepared him for the situation he now found himself in.\n\n"You what me to do what now?" he asked, the slightly tinge of fear creeping in as the three sirens stared him down. He fought the urge to take a step back; showing weakness was never a good thing.\n\n"It's quite simple," the siren in orange said. "We want a hippogriff who can run parts of this island in our stead while we focus on other things. And we believe that you can be that hippogriff."\n\nThe gears in Moonfeather's mind began turning. And then he realized it. This wasn't a meeting for threats or violence, or even being forced into compliance. This was something much better.\n\nIt was a business opportunity.\n\n"And I get to have full control over Aris just for working for you?" he asked, putting on the suave business look he was known for.\n\n"You'll be able to do whatever you want, so long as it also benefits us and keeps this place stable. Grease the gears, so to speak. But let me make something clear." Within seconds the siren was nose-to-beak against Moonfeather, staring daggers. "You listen to us. You follow our orders whenever we say them. And if you fail, we will not hesitate to throw you out and let the crowds deal with you instead. Is that clear?"\n\nMoonfeather quickly nodded. "Clear as crystal.""
 hippogriff_abyss.17.a:0 "He will be a useful pawn."
 
 hippogriff_abyss.18.t:0 "Old Enemies"
 hippogriff_abyss.18.d:0 "Adagio was still visibly seething in anger when Aria and Sonata rushed into the throne room, having been urgently called there. "What is it, Adagio?" Sonata asked, beating her fellow siren to the punch.\n\n"They're still alive," Adagio replied bitterly.\n\nSonata blinked. "Who?"\n\n"Starswirl and those 'Pillars of Equestria'."\n\nAria's expression immediately shifted from standard boredom into rage similar to that of Adagio, while Sonata just gave a shriek and tried hiding under a nearby table. "They aren't here, are they?" she asked. "I don't want to be banished again, not so soon after we got out!"\n\nSonata's antics were enough to shake Aria out of her anger, making the purple siren roll her eyes. "Of course they aren't here, Sonata. We'd have noticed them by now if they were." She turned her attention back to Adagio. "But we can't just let them get away with what they did either."\n\nAdagio, in a rare moment of agreement, nodded. "No, we can't. I don't know how they're still alive after all this time, but they have to pay for our banishment. I've tracked one of the Pillars to Maregypt; the others seem to be in Equestria, though I have not found Starswirl yet. But I don't care what it takes. We will have our revenge, and nothing is going to stop us."\n\n"We'll do it together," Aria said.\n\n"Together!" Sonata reaffirmed, sliding out from under the table with a semi-serious expression, a very rare sight for the normally bubbly siren. The trio looked at each other once before nodding."
 hippogriff_abyss.18.a:0 "This time, it's personal."

And then this has to happen. The few free hippogriffs remaining, in all their audacity, were actively choosing to fight back, setting back those conquests by who knows how long.\n\nIt was quite irritating.\n\n"The hippogriffs are proving more resilient then we thought," she told her partners, who had gathered once again in a spare room of the palace. "Every day they hinder us at every turn, and we have to expend more magic just to keep the rest in line. We have stopgaps, but this thorn needs to be removed."\n\n"That's obvious, Adagio," Aria replied in her ever-bored tone. "They're led by the former Princess Skystar, along with two nobodys. And they've gotten smarter and started using earplugs, so our magic doesn't affect them anymore."\n\n"Then why don't we just do what we always do?" Sonata asked. "We like, break up friendships all the time. It's how we get people to do what we want! Won't it be easier if they're fighting each other instead of us?"\n\nAria instinctively rolled her eyes. "Sonata, that's... actually an idea. Maybe you're not always the worst."\n\n"Really? Hey, wait a min-"\n\nAdagio cut them off before they could start fighting again. "Then it's settled.

 ### LEADERS #####
 HIP_POSADA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 14th of May, 980 in Seaquestria.\n\n§YBiography§!: For most of her childhood, Posada was ostracised by her peers. But she liked it that way, it left her more time to explore and play with her imaginary friends. She became an apprentice bookmaker in her teenaged years. When she first went to the surface, she looked upon the stars in wonder and often would stargaze while contemplating if there were creatures on other worlds. It was on one such night she accidentally drifted over towards Zebrican territory and was captured by the Storm King's forces.\n\nPosada was chained inside the cargo hold of an airship full of looted trophies and treasures from Colthage. During the long journey she suffered at the hands of her yeti captors, but one night she was able to break free of her shackles. Sneaking through the ship's hold, she was seeking to make a quick escape and then follow the stars home when a flash of green light caught her attention.\n\nThe light ebbed from out the crack in the lid of a large golden chest intricately carved with images of horned beasts and bowing goats. Unable to help herself, she broke the chains and opened the lid. What she saw would change her forever. Images flashed before her eyes, images of things nogriff should ever know. Images of conflict, strife, poverty and the stars, so many stars. She saw galaxies at the scale of atoms. She saw how stars burned. And more, much more, she could not understand.\n\nIt is unknown how she returned to Hippogriffia. Her mind was broken, and it was months before she could talk in coherent sentences again. Shortly after the Storm King's defeat, a copy of the works of Caramel Marks crossed her desk at work. She found the book as a symbol that she was destined to rediscover what the chest had shown her and to free everycreature from the shackles of capitalism and monarchy. She founded the Revolutionary Workers' Party and quickly started preaching her ideology to every hippogriff and seapony she could. Now with the RWP in power, the interstellar revolution is upon creaturekind.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Neither"
 HIP_POSADA_SAD_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 14th of May, 980 in Seaquestria.\n\n§YBiography§!: "Everything I did, I did for the revolution."\n\nPosada has believed in the promise of communism for years, and has seen with her own eyes how it benefits the world. But little by little, her idealism has cracked. Reactionaries, once met with rehabilitation, gradually became imprisoned for life and later simply shot.\n\nThe world looks grimmer every day, and the rare rays of light in her life gradually distanced themselves from her, as if fearing being contaminated themselves. Few indeed are the associates she genuinely enjoys the company of anymore, and fewer still the creatures who say what she wishes they would: that she's gone too far and has to stop. \n\nOceans of blood have been spilled at her directive, ruthless operations justified by the fact that this is necessary for a better world. That excuse still holds water, but it seems drier than it once did. The revolution is worth dying for, but is it truly worth massacring for?\n\nPosada knows in her heart that she has become a monster, one the Storm King would welcome with a smile as a sister-in-arms. The only thing that gives her the energy to rise from bed is the terrible knowledge that there are so many worse monsters still left to slay.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Neither"
 HIP_POSADA_GOODEND_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 14th of May, 980 in Seaquestria.\n\n§YBiography§!: Communism has won against all odds, and the dream has been fulfilled. Throughout the lands of Revolutionary North Zebrica, suffering, poverty, and scarcity are things of the past. Nuclear reactors dot the land like gemstones, powering entire cities and providing the state with an ever-growing supply of fissile material. The scientific method has been applied to politics, and government is administrated with maximum efficiency with an eye towards fairness. The stars shine as bright as the souls of the creatures building this utopia.\n\nPosada has known for years that this world was not the only to harbor life. It'd simply be impossible to have only one planet with creatures upon it. Somewhere out there, in the vast cosmos, are Star People, creatures who have moved past the troubles of reaction and violence, and formed glorious civilizations aglow amongst the constellations. \n\nRevolutionary North Zebrica, once the small state known as Hippogriffia, has become a beacon calling out to the stars. Communism has prevailed here, and grand efforts are underway to contact the astral comrades. \n\nPosada has come far from the broken madfish she once was. Her soul has crystallized with a clear purpose: to win the great war against reaction, to uplift the lives of all creatures around the world, and to reach out to the Star People and gain their aid in creating a better, more loving world.\n\nThe aliens will come - and Posada will welcome them with open fins.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Neither"

 CRACK_LIGHTNING_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 4th of February, 977 in Harmonizing Heights.\n\n§YBiography§!: If you'd asked anygriff what Crack Lightning's future held after his rise to fame as an ace pilot in the Storm War, none would have guessed he planned on becoming the voice of the Aris First nationalist movement, much less the supreme commander of Aris' armed forces or the de facto ruler of Hippogriffia.\n\nFew now remember that Crack Lightning opposed the move to Seaquestria following the Storm King's arrival, nor that until his rise to fame he had never particularly cared for traditionalism, for all of that has been wiped away by the bombastic fervour of his commitment to Aris First after his round-the-world flight.\n\nPassionate, young, aggressive, adventurous, seductive, he was everything Aris First needed to contrast the stoic Raft Wood and to rile up the youth into a nationalistic frenzy. Few suspected that his ambitions went far beyond the isolationism of his colleague, and those that did notice found their objections falling on deaf ears as his influence grew and his followers grew more zealous. Now with Raft Wood out of the picture, Hippogriffia is under the full control of Crack Lightning, and there is little doubt that "The Ace," as his followers call him, will put the country's considerable might towards creating the Hegemony he dreams of.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofus"
 RAFT_WOOD_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 13th of June, 950 in Seaquestria.\n\n§YBiography§!: Advisor, populist, nationalist, disgrace, leader. Raft Wood has been many things over the years, rising through Novo's court to become one of her chief advisors during the difficult days of the Storm King. It was his idea to migrate the hippogriff population to Seaquestria, and in the aftermath of the triumphant Storm War he saw his influence fade.\n\nBlamed for everything that went wrong during the isolation, called a coward by hippogriffs and foreigners alike, Raft Wood lost his influence in the court but never his faith in Queen Novo or Hippogriffia. His waning period turned out to be a cocoon, from which emerged a transformed Raft Wood: reaffirming everything he believed in, he masterminded the nationalist Aris First movement alongside ace pilot Crack Lightning, becoming the first to bring mass politics to Hippogriffia.\n\nA vocal supporter of the Anti-Harmonic Activities Committee and the superiority of the Arisian way of life, Raft Wood found his fortunes rising as nationalism and Harmony blended together in the popular consciousness and, eventually, the law of the land in Hippogriffia. When Novo appointed him chairpony of the AHAC and granted him and Crack Lightning extensive emergency powers, Raft Wood expected to comfortably lead Aris into a new era free of foreign influence.\n\nTo his dismay, he soon found himself dragged into two conflicts: the raging North Zebrican War on the one fin, and a shadow conflict with his former compatriot Crack Lightning on the other, who intended to use Raft Wood's movement to transform Aris into a fascist dictatorship. With Lightning exposed and apprehended, Raft Wood stands as the leader of [HIP.GetName], nothing stands in Raft Wood's way of pursuing a strong, united, and pure Aris, save perhaps his own nagging doubts at how deeply Crack Lightning's venomous ideology has seeped into his followers.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofus"
 
 HIP_SIR_ADAGIO_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Time Immemorial\n\n§YBiography§!: Since recorded history, even before the time of the Princesses of Equestria, when monsters ruled and cowed the native ponies, the sirens have existed in this world. A group of three, they traveled the land spreading fear and hatred with their magical voices, plunging Equestria into further disharmony and feeding off of the negative energy that followed. Only the creation of the legendary Pillars of Harmony were able to defeat them, tricking the trio into banishment at the bottom of the Mareiana Trench, far below the ocean waves for over a thousand years.\n\nAdagio Dazzle is the leader of the three sirens, and for good reason. Even without magic her voice carries with it a stunning amount of charisma, and her elaborate plans are both long and rarely ever fail. Yet despite that she is extremely egotistical and controlling even compared to her fellow sirens, and believes that only she can lead the three to their rightful places as the masters of the entire world.\n\nAdagio believes everything can be solved using their magic and their voices, a sentiment not exactly shared with her partners. She sees Aria as too distracted by her "what ifs" and a constant annoyance due to her constant fights with Sonata, who she sees as a loose cannon at best and an active hinderance at worst. Still, she works with them for a shared dream and her birthright; for everyone in this world to adore her.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"
 HIP_SIR_ARIA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Time Immemorial\n\n§YBiography§!: Since recorded history, even before the time of the Princesses of Equestria, when monsters ruled and cowed the native ponies, the sirens have existed in this world. A group of three, they traveled the land spreading fear and hatred with their magical voices, plunging Equestria into further disharmony and feeding off of the negative energy that followed. Only the creation of the legendary Pillars of Harmony were able to defeat them, tricking the trio into banishment at the bottom of the Mareiana Trench, far below the ocean waves for over a thousand years.\n\nAria Blaze is the serious and level-headed member of the sirens, being a stark contrast to her partners and their eccentricity. While being just as capable of manipulation as Adagio, Aria concerns herself more with what could happen, no matter how unlikely those situations could be. Her plans and backup plans are thorough and numerous, which could even be described as paranoia in some cases.\n\nHaving learned of the new world and the vast differences from the old, Aria is a proponent of less-magical solutions to problems she and the others come across, seeing them as more reliable than continuing to trust in their magic never failing after her banishment. While she does listen to Adagio, she sees her fellow siren as too obsessed with world domination and egotistical to see the possibility of their plans falling apart, and Aria's annoyance with Sonata's carefree attitude has led to many an argument. Still, she works with them side by side, for Aria knows that her fellow sirens are the only creatures she can trust completely.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"
 HIP_SIR_SONATA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Time Immemorial\n\n§YBiography§!: Since recorded history, even before the time of the Princesses of Equestria, when monsters ruled and cowed the native ponies, the sirens have existed in this world. A group of three, they traveled the land spreading fear and hatred with their magical voices, plunging Equestria into further disharmony and feeding off of the negative energy that followed. Only the creation of the legendary Pillars of Harmony were able to defeat them, tricking the trio into banishment at the bottom of the Mareiana Trench, far below the ocean waves for over a thousand years.\n\nSonata Dusk is an outlier among the three, severely lacking in any sort of skill regarding intentional manipulation. Often forgetful and ditzy, Sonata legitimately enjoys music of all kinds, including music being played by others. She hates boredom, and prefers doing things and being in the moment, as opposed to the other two with their long plans and eyes on the future.\n\nSonata frequently gets into arguments with Aria over trivial matters, which constantly results in Adagio having to intervene in their pointless arguments. This has led to Sonata seeing Aria as "no-fun", and Adagio as the leader with the evil plans. The result of this has been her being the siren most involved with the enthralled population, preferring to get away from her partners often when possible and occasionally unwittingly doing something useful in the process. Despite it all, though, she still cares about the trio and does whatever she can to help, even if it isn't always useful.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"
