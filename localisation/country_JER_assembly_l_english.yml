aquileia_assembly.1.t:0 "The Vyzima Strikes Memorial"
aquileia_assembly.1.d:0 "The Vyzima strikes that ended in a bloodbath have been a controversial event for a long time. Even within our revolutionary movements some people saw the actions of the strikers as understable but misguided and ultimately harmful to the cause of the strike. The debate has now turned and it is now understood that the Vyzima strike was only an early step in our proletarian revolution. Shedding tears over the murder of robber barons such as Charles Desvases only makes sense within the restraints of bourgeois morality.\n\nThe Desvases mansion has recently been acquired by the state after the arrest of Jeanne Desvases, the heiress of the Desvases fortune. It has been modified and refurbished to become a maison du peuple, a cultural place where all workers will be free to meet and enjoy the best that the worker’s spirit has to offer.\n\nA memorial dedicated to the strikers bearing the name of all strikers killed during the repression of the strike and also the name of the poor servants who joined the striker during the hostage taking of Desvases and were massacred by the police along the line of the heroes."
aquileia_assembly.1.a:0 "We will remember the heroes of Vyzima!"

aquileia_assembly.2.t:0 "The Little Fledgling Dispute"
aquileia_assembly.2.d:0 "A strange controversy has erupted regarding the figure of Banneriot. The well-liked fledgling, symbol of the revolution, has been enshrined in various places in Aquileia. The ministry of culture sought to use this and launched a contest to design an official design for Banneriot.\n\nTwo drawings made the final cut but the jury remains decidedly split over it. The first image is in direct line of the well-known Banneriot as an angry fledgling, yelling for freedom. However, he has been drawn with a very wild attitude and in a way that some feels a bit out of place now that the revolution seeks to transition into normalcy. The second one is drawn in a much different manner. That Banneriot has been made to look much more proud, triumphant and somewhat older. He carries his flag not as a rebel but as a proud defender of his homeland. It has been criticized as at odds with the idea of a righteous anger but he has his supporters as a more mature incarnation of the Republic. They have been nicknamed “Wild Banneriot” and “Proud Banneriot”.\n\nThe “Proud or Wild” debate has spilled over to the general publics. While both incarnations have their supporters in all factions, the wild Banneriot has found a stronger support amongst the Travailleurs and the left wing of the Front des Jeunes Aquileia while the proud Banneriot is being championed by the more conservative republicans and, paradoxically enough, some of the radicals of the Travailleurs."
aquileia_assembly.2.a:0 "I prefer the former"
aquileia_assembly.2.b:0 "I prefer the latter"

aquileia_assembly.3.t:0 "Lost In Translation"
aquileia_assembly.3.d:0 "Today, a controversy has rocked the Assemblée Nationale and the session had to be suspended. Foreign journalists were puzzled as Victor Allard, the Travailleurs firebrand, was yelled at for calling the second republic… The second republic. Many correspondents  simply poked fun at the controversy. Conservative and communist leaning reporters had a field day ridiculing the event as either a proof of republican incompetence or as an incomprehensible attack on the Travailleurs.\n\nIce Cream Scoop, the Manehattan Herald correspondent, was the first to make sense of the situation for outside observers. Having attended the session and speaking perfect aquileian, having been raised in Pridea, she explained in her piece that the controversy was real and not a simple joke. Aquileian has two words for second “deuxième” and “seconde” and while the latter has been used by all politicians to describe the current Republic, Allard used the former. The controversy sparked from a subtle nuance. To say “Seconde République” means that there have been only two republics and it carries the idea that there won’t be anymore. “Deuxième” doesn’t have any of that meaning and simply states that something is second in a serie. Effectively, Allard implied that the current republic had an expiring date, symbolically attacking the legitimacy of the current regime."
aquileia_assembly.3.a:0 "Maybe we should fund more language lessons..."

aquileia_assembly.4.t:0 "Where the Nation’s Memory Lies"
aquileia_assembly.4.d:0 "The Assemblée Nationale is making great strides in crafting legislation to establish a national administration of the archives and protection of the national heritage. While the legislation itself has been largely consensual, the debate has bogged down due to the matter of the archives’ location. Many députés have tried to push for the seat of the administration to be set outside of the capital as originally intended. The proposal of another seat, first initiated by the député of Rila has transformed into a true chaos as députés from everywhere tried to push for another location. Over time, députés eventually coalesced around certain locations: Aquila itself, Rila, Vinovia and, surprisingly enough Vanguardigo. The last suggestion has been particularly popular among députés from the rural circonscriptions but has the downside of not having the prestige of other locations.\n\nThe députés are now calling for the president to break the tie."
aquileia_assembly.4.a:0 "Vinovia will do."
aquileia_assembly.4.b:0 "Vanguardigo."
aquileia_assembly.4.c:0 "Rila it is."
aquileia_assembly.4.e:0 "The capital will do fine."

aquileia_assembly.5.t:0 "The Table Bill"
aquileia_assembly.5.d:0 "The Assemblée Nationale is in the midst of a budgetary debate over the gastronomical matters. While the press has largely mocked the debate, the chamber does need to have its own mess hall to make sure that the debates are not unduly interrupted at dinner time. Three plans have been proposed : funding a parliamentary restaurant, giving the députés a good and beverages allowance and finally funding a basic mess hall.\n\nUnder the first plan, a wing of the Assemblée Nationale’s building would be set aside to become a luxurious restaurant. While it would obviously please the députés the most, it could also become a please to host special guests and improve the prestige of the institution.\n\nUnder the allowance plan, each député would have to go out to the town’s restaurants and cafes to eat. This would undoubtedly please the capital’s gastronomical businesses and would allow us to not have to deal with the logistics of a restaurant. However, some have pointed out that it could distract the députés from their work or allow lobbyists to wine and dine them.\n\nFinally, the mess hall plan has mostly been put forward by a coalition of socialists, religious conservatives and some other frugal representatives. They argue that the nation’s elite should remain citizens and not a gilded elite. As such, the parliamentary mess hall would serve reasonable meals that could be served to simple workers. It is safe to say that most députés wouldn’t take such an option in stride.\n\nWe have been urged to way in."
aquileia_assembly.5.a:0 "Bon appétit, messieurs les députés!"
aquileia_assembly.5.b:0 "Give them an allowance and be done with it."
aquileia_assembly.5.c:0 "They will eat what they get in their plates!"
