 SCS_aint_that_a_kick_in_the_head_desc:0 "In these troubled times, sometimes we have to take actions which might have been unthinkable beforehoof.

 SCS_southern_democrat_victory_desc:0 "Just because we left the motherland behind doesn’t mean we can’t take the best of it with us. Harmony endured for millenia for good reasons, and we embrace it now. Let us be friends with the past but reach out for the future together."

 civwar.2.a:0 "Thanks y'all!"


 scs.1.t:0 "Confederate Chairman Elections"
 scs.1.d:0 "Ever since the turbulent Declaration of Secession, Chairman Silverstar has valiantly lead us through those trying times. With situation stabilized somewhat, the Chairman agreed to hold elections for the highest state position, himself running as a candidate. However, while for some his victory may seem certain, radical Confederate Defence League has been consolidating its support base, while the moderate Friendship-Union Party and its prodigy candidate Braeburn have ran a campaign promising a truly democratic state for all species. With the election day drawing near, emotions are running high, and the winner is uncertain."

They have begun banding into informal defence groups, calling themselvse Minuteponies - ready to fight at a minute's notice. While they do not have official state support, they pledged their lives for the Confederation and the Southern Way."

However, due to the current situation, a creation of an ad-hoc Coast Guard has been approved. While small and composed of jury-rigged ships, this may be a beginning of a true navy."

 scs.10.d:0 "With the accession of the Loyalist "Equestrian Sun Party" to power, the ponies of the South have formally requested to rejoin Equestria. It seems that independence only served to allow the rich and powerful to trample on the rights of the little pony, rights that we had strenuously protected. Crowds of cheering ponies celebrated the passing of the Bill to dissolve the government of the SCS and re-absorb it into Equestria."

 scs.11.d:0 "With the accession of the Loyalist "Equestrian Sun Party" to power, the ponies of the South have formally requested to rejoin Equestria as an autonomous region. It seems that independence only served to allow the rich and powerful to trample on the rights of the little pony, rights that we had strenuously protected. Crowds of cheering ponies celebrated the passing of the Bill to rearrange the Confederate government into a part of the Equestrian state."
 scs.11.a:0 "A heartening sign!"
 
 scs.12.t:0 "The Confederate States Wants Us To Join With Them"
 scs.12.d:0 "A delegation from the Southerners has arrived in Crystal City bearing a proposal. The center could not hold, and now the north and south of united ponydom must survive the chaos together. Instead of isolation and defeat, we could together keep a watchful eye over the maelstrom between our countries. We have no cultural ties to one another except for Equestrian rule, but its a new world, and that means new starts for everyone."
 scs.12.a:0 "A heartening sign!"
 
 scs.21.t:0 "The Southponies Offer Us A Deal"
 scs.21.d:0 "After much internal debate and some impassioned words, a delegation from the Confederacy approaches the Buffalo. The differences between the Buffalo and the Southern ponies have proven intractable and unending, and while Celestia was in charge they were also managed. But things cannot continue. We need that land. The Buffalo can surrender it and we will give them some reservations to live on."
 scs.21.a:0 "Finally, an answer."
 
 scs.22.t:0 "With Generosity and Charity"
 scs.22.d:0 "A delegation arrives from the Confederacy with a startling offer. Southern ponies and Buffalo have had their differences, but now we must unite against the growing chaos on the continent. They can join the Confederacy as a full state. \n\nBut there is trouble. Not all Buffalo find this to be a good deal at all. Why should they give up an ounce of autonomy to work alongside ponies who already don’t respect them? The Confederates cannot abide an enclave, and the Buffalo are keen to keep their freedom. Acceptance would change the status quo in ways unknown, but refusal here could lead to war."
 scs.22.a:0 "United at last?"
 scs.22.b:0 "Our last chance for peace..."
 
 scs.23.t:0 "Our Approach To The Radicals"
 scs.23.d:0 "In the ranks of the Coltlumbia party there is a kind of cancer. While we have always thought of ourselves as rough and able sorts of ponies, these Radicals are merely bloodthirsty tyrants. Whenever the debate in the legislature is particularly heated, they slip in their poisonous rhetoric. Every injustice or misfortune becomes a breeding ground for their whispering.\n\nAt last, the time has come to deal with these malcontents. Should we go for the extreme option, or should we show mercy? Some argue that the leaders are the true villains, and their followers are merely deluded fools who’s hearts are in the right place.\n\nThis may be true, but what matters is action, not sentiment. Well meaning fools are not, they have riled up some of our ponies into frenzy. Above all, we need stability and order if we are to survive and thrive. What shall we do with the Radicals?"

Confederation offers an escape from both into a system of mutual cooperation. At least, that’s the party line, whoever is in charge these days. The reality is that the confederates are pragmatic enough to realize that eventually their little party is going to have to expand to be viable. Don’t mind the name, they say with charm and a lovely, sugared drawl. The confederacy ain’t just about being a southern pony, after all!\n\nTheir resources are valuable, and their money is good.

The nation had failed, and they have been awfully quick to remind everyone who will listen.\n\nBut things have changed. The Confederacy, for better or worse, was always going to have to deal with its Northern neighbors and former comrades at some point. In an attempt to avoid the inevitable conflict and revanchism that comes from bad blood, the Southerners approach the winners of the great schism with an offer of friendship.

The South is seperate from Equestria, and must seek its future as its own nation. That nation would like to be friends, maybe even close allies, but never again will Southerners be a part of Equestria. The name is chosen out of nervousness by its writers, for they know this will not be received gladly even by friendly northerners."

 scs.39.t:0 "States' Rights Guaranteed"
 scs.39.d:0 "After much controversy, and quite a bit of private consternation, those that fought and bled to win Equestria face a bittersweet reality. No matter what they might wish were true, they cannot live in the world before the schism. The South left, and only by self-defeating force of arms can they bring it home again. Guaranteeing the rights and freedom of the states, as the Confederates have suggested, will ensure that at least North and South can part as neighbors and comrades. It is the best course of action.\n\nThe treaty’s ratification is met with jubilation in the cities of the confederate states, where the growing concern about northern interference in their newfound independence had been festering. There will be peace in all our times!"
 scs.39.a:0 "Equestria guarentees its new neighbor!"
 
 scs.40.t:0 "The Cold Shoulder"
 scs.40.d:0 "The treaty is rejected quickly, almost out of hand. The south is an integral part of Equestria, and it has been for a long time. The southern ponies may have tamed and gentled the land, but they did it with Canterlot’s guidance and blessing, Manehattan’s tools, Baltimare’s manpower and ships… The point is that there is no ‘North’ and ‘South’ in the eyes of Canterlot’s masters. There are only those who understand reality, and a bunch of dewy-eyed, slackjawed fools who think they can just make a country out of tumbleweeds and spit.\n\nThe Southern delegation is sent packing, and there is civil unrest in Hoofington and Appleoosa as citizens panic at the thought of an imminent northern invasion, one that they cannot possibly hope to survive."
 scs.40.a:0 "The dream may yet die."
 
 scs.41.t:0 "Southrons Bearing Gifts"
 scs.41.d:0 "The south, determined to leverage its resources to secure its place in the sun, offers its northern neighbors a new treaty. Friends or not, everyone needs oils. The world has changed, and with it changes what is and is not essential. A hundred years ago, the oil in the states wasn’t worth that much. Nowadays it is absolutely vital for everything from industry to defense.\n\nThe northern victors need that oil. Everyone does. Why waste valuable resources to obtain it, when the Confederates are willing to offer Favored Nation status and increased trade in oil in return for a little peace? What’s the harm? And in return, maybe a few… consumer goods?"
 scs.38.a:0 "Let's make a deal."
 scs.38.b:0 "Canterlot doesn't barter with traitors."
 
 scs.42.t:0 "Bilateral Trade Deal Secured"
 scs.42.d:0 "Modern war and modern economy require oil to stay alive, and with some reluctance, the states win over their neighbors. Few can resist the magnet pull of the black gold and however attractive owning it directly might be, not having to spend a red cent on bullets to acquire loads of it at cheap prices is too good a prospect to pass on.\n\nThings may change if Equestria can find new avenues to secure its oil, but its inability to do so (and perhaps even a genuine hope for peace!) is why it signs. The South is pleased, knowing that as Equestrian magnates pull oil out of their ground, truckloads of consumer goods, raw materials, and vital food supplies pour into the Confederacy in return."
 scs.42.a:0 "Black gold!"
 
 scs.43.t:0 "Talks Break Down"
 scs.43.d:0 "The Southern effort to buy peace and better trade terms with its oil break down as tempers flare around the negotiating table in Canterlot. The southerners see this deal, cheaper oil for low tariffs, as perfectly reasonable. The northern ponies see it less as a gentlestallion’s deal and more as highway robbery by a pack of cowards and traitors. Why should they bargain for oil that, in their minds, is theirs by right? Who said these upstarts had the right to claim it in the first place?\n\nWhile there’s no open talk of war, this chilly reception has certainly dampened many hopes for peaceful co-existence among the confederate populace. Whosoever rules from Canterlot in a very real way dictates the jig the continent dances too, and this particular hoedown may not have room for them."
 scs.43.a:0 "Dagnabbit!"
 
 scs.44.t:0 "A Royal Tour?"
 scs.44.d:0 "The Confederates have sent a delegation to Canterlot, this time with a surprising proposal. In the past, many southern ponies pointed to the lack of direct royal involvement as one of their grievances against central rule. Now, independant southern ponies arrive suggesting that the Princess at last tour her former domains, this time not as a sovereign but as a visitor.\n\nThey promise luxury, but also a full tour of all the good to be seen. On one hoof, this is a good way to promote peace between two potentially hostile nations. On the other, it’s also a good way to show Canterlot that there may be more value in an independant but built-up south than an integrated but empty one."
 scs.44.a:0 "We will go."
 scs.44.b:0 "Send an official."
 scs.44.c:0 "Ignore the upstarts."
