 SCS_constitutional_convention:0 "Confederate Constitutional Convention"
 SCS_constitutional_convention_desc:0 "Secession itself was the first step. Now comes the hard part. We have to create a government that can actually preserve our newfound independence, one with a constitution and a clear structure."
 SCS_the_first_election:0 "The First Southern Election"
 SCS_the_first_election_desc:0 "The first full election is perhaps the most tenuous moment in any republics lifetime. The peaceful transferral of power is not immediate or a given. Proving that the SCS can and will function as intended is vital."
 SCS_equestrian_sun_victory:0 "The Sun Rises"
 SCS_equestrian_sun_victory_desc:0 "In the months since our secession, we have tried our best to create an independent state. But we should never have left, and our attempts have been mixed. We should seek the protection of the Sun once more."
 SCS_coltlumbia_victory:0 "Hail Coltlumbia"
 SCS_coltlumbia_victory_desc:0 "The course of neutrality and stability has served us well and it will continue to keep us afloat. Neighvis was the first to propose the Republic, so why should he not lead it? "
 SCS_southern_democrat_victory:0 "Harmony, Benevolence, and Independence"
 SCS_southern_democrat_victory_desc:0 "Just because we left the motherland behind doesn’t mean we can’t take the best of it with us. Harmony endured for millenia for good reasons, and we embrace it now. Let us be friends with the past but reach out for the future together."
 SCS_will_unlock_new_focuses:0 "§BThis will unlock a new political focus branch§!"
 SCS_buffalo_in_the_room:0 "The Buffalo In The Room"
 SCS_buffalo_in_the_room_desc:0 "Our relations with the Buffalo have always been strained. We have avoided outright violence, but for how long? We need our orchards, and they refuse to leave our trees alone. Something has to give, one way or another."
 SCS_grand_army_of_the_confederacy:0 "Grand Army of the Confederacy"
 SCS_grand_army_of_the_confederacy_desc:0 "The militia forces of the Minuteponies served us well, but we cannot rely on ad hoc irregular forces forever. A commission must be formed to create a new Grand Army of the Confederacy."
 SCS_right_to_bear_arms:0 "The Right To Bear Arms"
 SCS_right_to_bear_arms_desc:0 "The Gun shaped our culture, and few ponies in the south are far from one, even an old one. They keep the monsters and the bandits at bay… but we may have a bit of a problem with potential… friendly fire."
 SCS_national_security_act:0 "The National Security Act"
 SCS_national_security_act_desc:0 "The nation is newborn, and still weak. Untrustworthy ponies running around with guns is too much to handle right now. Law, order, rights, and peace!"
 SCS_the_southern_economy:0 "The Southern Economy"
 SCS_the_southern_economy_desc:0 "The Southern Economy rests on two things--oil and agriculture. The first we have in abundance, and the second is constantly threatened. Living as we do in the deserts and dry plains between Equestria and the Jungle, we must capitalize every advantage."
 SCS_no_regulations:0 "No Regulations, No Limits"
 SCS_no_regulations_desc:0 "The barons built the South, and they promise with unfettered hooves they can complete their work. Give them but a few years at least without restraint or unnecessary regulation, and they will create the Great Society we all long for And the Confederacy will be Rich."
 SCS_sober_middle_ground:0 "The Sober Middle Ground"
 SCS_sober_middle_ground_desc:0 "The extremes of dangerous deregulation and stifling over-regulation must be avoided. We cannot afford at this moment to strangle our nascent industry, but we refuse to crush the poor workers under the weight of the rich. Let us find a middle path."
 SCS_nanny_state:0 "Top-Down Regulation"
 SCS_nanny_state_desc:0 "Efficiency is not worth the cost in lives and quality of life. We can be efficient without being cartoonishly monstrous as the barons want. Let us preserve the rights of the workers and protect our society from these predators."

 SCS_mass_doctrine_desc:0 "Our militia ponies have always relied on strength of numbers to ensure success against monsters, buffalo, or anything else they might face. Why change that now?"
 SCS_guns_bonus:0 "Invest in Gun Tech"
 SCS_guns_bonus_desc:0 "Our old weapons are fine tools, but even the best tools become outdated. We need better rifles, but we also need artillery and machine guns for the wars of modernity. An investment today is victory tomorrow."
 SCS_tanks_light_or_heavy:0 "Confederate Armor"
 SCS_tanks_light_or_heavy_desc:0 "Some of our old militia captains were a bit hesitant about this tank business, but we've won them over. Armor is the way of the future, and any infantry force without it is toast. We need some of our own!"
 SCS_motorised_bonus:0 "Truckin' Along"
 SCS_motorised_bonus_desc:0 "Now, if there's one thing a southern soldier is excited about, its a nice new truck. Trucks are the range pony of modern warfare--they're reliable, fast, and carry a lot. Give us a few thousand of these and nothing will be out of our reach."

 civwar.2.t:0 "The South Rises!"
 civwar.2.d:0 "Patriotic, hard-working folks of the South have risen in defence of their homes, forming the basis of Confederate military."
 civwar.2.a:0 "Thanks y'all!"


 scs.1.t:0 "Confederate Chairman Elections"
 scs.1.d:0 "Ever since the turbulent Declaration of Secession, Chairman Silverstar has valiantly lead us through those trying times. With situation stabilized somewhat, the Chairman agreed to hold elections for the highest state position, himself running as a candidate. However, while for some his victory may seem certain, radical Confederate Defence League has been consolidating its support base, while the moderate Friendship-Union Party and its prodigy candidate Braeburn have ran a campaign promising a truly democratic state for all species. With the election day drawing near, emotions are running high, and the winner is uncertain."
 scs.1.c:0 "Defence League's candidate Beuford wins!"
 scs.1.b:0 "Silverstar gets reelected!"
 scs.1.a:0 "Braeburn wins by a thin margin!"

 scs.2.t:0 "Minutepony Volunteers"
 scs.2.d:0 "While we have managed to form a Militia, huge numbers of patriotic ponies have decided that they can provide support in defence of their homes. They have begun banding into informal defence groups, calling themselvse Minuteponies - ready to fight at a minute's notice. While they do not have official state support, they pledged their lives for the Confederation and the Southern Way."
 scs.2.a:0 "Three cheers for our Minuteponies!"
 scs.2.tt:0 "Spawns §YSix Minuteponies Volunteer Divisions§!"

 scs.3.t:0 "Confederate Coast Guard"
 scs.3.d:0 "Southern ponies have never been great sailors - with boundless plains and endless deserts filling in for the sea. However, due to the current situation, a creation of an ad-hoc Coast Guard has been approved. While small and composed of jury-rigged ships, this may be a beginning of a true navy."
 scs.3.a:0 "I wish I was in Appleloosa!"
 scs.3.tt:0 "Spawns §Y2 Destroyers§!"

 scs.4.t:0 "Confederate Constitutional Convention"

 scs.4.a:0 "The South rises!"

 scs.5.t:0 "Private Aviators"
 scs.5.d:0 "Many wealthier farmers are using aeroplanes for agriculture purposes. With their way of life endangered, they have pledged their machines to amateur pilots. While inexperienced, they certainly do not lack in enthusiasm!"
 scs.5.a:0 "Watch your head!"

 scs.6.t:0 "The Confederation wants us to join them"
 scs.6.d:0 "The newly formed Confederation of South States considers our lands an integral part of their country. We know that they have no love for Buffaloes, but maybe we will be stronger, if we bury the war axe and unite in friendship under one banner?"
 scs.6.a:0 "Let us become friends."
 scs.6.b:0 "They do not have good intentions toward us."

 scs.7.t:0 "Buffalo Tribes refuse our proposal!"
 scs.7.d:0 "The savage Buffaloes have refused our proposal of returning our land! This is a disaster for the ruling Chairman [SCS.GetLeader], with Southern Defence Party quick to capitalize."
 scs.7.a:0 "There is nothing we can do."
 scs.7.b:0 "To Tartarus with negotiations, this is our land!"

 scs.8.t:0 "Strike the Buffaloes?"

 scs.8.a:0 "Attack now!"
 scs.8.b:0 "We need to prepare first."
 
 scs.10.t:0 "The Confederate States Returns To The Fold"
 scs.10.d:0 "With the accession of the Loyalist "Equestrian Sun Party" to power, the ponies of the South have formally requested to rejoin Equestria. It seems that independence only served to allow the rich and powerful to trample on the rights of the little pony, rights that we had strenuously protected. Crowds of cheering ponies celebrated the passing of the Bill to dissolve the government of the SCS and re-absorb it into Equestria."
 scs.10.a:0 "A heartening sign!"
 
 scs.11.t:0 "The Confederate States Asks For Subregion Status"
 scs.11.d:0 "With the accession of the Loyalist "Equestrian Sun Party" to power, the ponies of the South have formally requested to rejoin Equestria as an autonomous region. It seems that independence only served to allow the rich and powerful to trample on the rights of the little pony, rights that we had strenuously protected. Crowds of cheering ponies celebrated the passing of the Bill to rearrange the Confederate government into a part of the Equestrian state."
 scs.11.a:0 "A heartening sign!"
 
 scs.12.t:0 "The Confederate States Wants Us To Join With Them"
 scs.12.d:0 "A delegation from the Southerners has arrived in Crystal City bearing a proposal. The center could not hold, and now the north and south of united ponydom must survive the chaos together. Instead of isolation and defeat, we could together keep a watchful eye over the maelstrom between our countries. We have no cultural ties to one another except for Equestrian rule, but its a new world, and that means new starts for everyone."
 scs.12.a:0 "A heartening sign!"
 
 scs.21.t:0 "The Southponies Offer Us A Deal"
 scs.21.d:0 "After much internal debate and some impassioned words, a delegation from the Confederacy approaches the Buffalo. The differences between the Buffalo and the Southern ponies have proven intractable and unending, and while Celestia was in charge they were also managed. But things cannot continue. We need that land. The Buffalo can surrender it and we will give them some reservations to live on."
 scs.21.a:0 "Finally, an answer."
 
 scs.22.t:0 "With Generosity and Charity"
 scs.22.d:0 "A delegation arrives from the Confederacy with a startling offer. Southern ponies and Buffalo have had their differences, but now we must unite against the growing chaos on the continent. They can join the Confederacy as a full state. \n\nBut there is trouble. Not all Buffalo find this to be a good deal at all. Why should they give up an ounce of autonomy to work alongside ponies who already don’t respect them? The Confederates cannot abide an enclave, and the Buffalo are keen to keep their freedom. Acceptance would change the status quo in ways unknown, but refusal here could lead to war."
 scs.22.a:0 "United at last?"
 scs.22.b:0 "Our last chance for peace..."
 
 scs.23.t:0 "Our Approach To The Radicals"
 scs.23.d:0 "In the ranks of the Coltlumbia party there is a kind of cancer. While we have always thought of ourselves as rough and able sorts of ponies, these Radicals are merely bloodthirsty tyrants. Whenever the debate in the legislature is particularly heated, they slip in their poisonous rhetoric. Every injustice or misfortune becomes a breeding ground for their whispering.\n\nAt last, the time has come to deal with these malcontents. Should we go for the extreme option, or should we show mercy? Some argue that the leaders are the true villains, and their followers are merely deluded fools who’s hearts are in the right place.\n\nThis may be true, but what matters is action, not sentiment. Well meaning fools are not, they have riled up some of our ponies into frenzy. Above all, we need stability and order if we are to survive and thrive. What shall we do with the Radicals?"
 scs.23.a:0 "Censor them!"
 scs.23.b:0 "Live and let live."
 
 scs.24.t:0 "The Sheriffs' Protest"
 scs.24.d:0 "The Lawponies have always been, at least in their own eyes, the protector of the people. In the mostly untamed south, these gunslingin’, hoofblade swingin’ regulators have done their best to clear out bandit and beast alike. But the power of the Gun is intoxicating, and there has never been much in the way of oversight. Lawponies are the Law itself, but they are still just mortal ponies, and so are prone to mistakes and acts of sometimes unwarranted violence. As the nascent Confederacy tries to rationalize its laws, these frontier sheriffs lodge a protest across the nation.\n\nAre they right? Is oversight just a trick to crush freedom or go easy on villainy? Or should we begin to ask ourselves who exactly it is that watches the watchponies?"

If anyone knows the allure of money, its him--and his words have reached more and more ponies. Some are swayed by his charismatic confidence, and others by his success… and others by his deep pockets.\n\nWorking diligently alongside dozens of pages and a few independent investigators, the leadership of the Coltlumbia Party has not only secured hard evidence of Rockhoof’s many crimes--bribery, extortion, fraud--but also has spread it like wildfire. Neighvis confronts Rockhoof and his supporters in front of the entire Senate, laying out a list of crimes that stretches across the republic. The list of bribed senators is unbearably long, and in a panic one and then another breaks down and confesses. General chaos reigns, but none of it helps Rockhoof. His credibility with any but the most perversely cynical is shot."

Confederation offers an escape from both into a system of mutual cooperation. At least, that’s the party line, whoever is in charge these days. The reality is that the confederates are pragmatic enough to realize that eventually their little party is going to have to expand to be viable. Don’t mind the name, they say with charm and a lovely, sugared drawl. The confederacy ain’t just about being a southern pony, after all!\n\nTheir resources are valuable, and their money is good.

Lines of communication which millions rely on have been severed, and with this came shortages. Merchants no longer have the singular monolithic presence of royal law to keep the rules of the market clear, and now even within Confederate borders there are discrepancies in law and custom that drive businessponies mad.\n\nWhile the southern half of the continent can make do without a common currency, it cannot do without some degree of standardization across the region.

The south’s a rough, interesting place these days, and they want a pact of mutual protection. Ain’t exactly likely that they’re going to war anytime soon, and whatever attacks them is likely coming for us next. Some cooperation would be nice too.

While they will certainly be buying our whisky, our cider, and our oil to boot, they’ve no interest in any treaties or arrangements beyond their insistence on free trade. The latent protectionism of the Coltlumbia Party’s origins makes them uneasy, it seems.\n\nBeyond being obnoxious and insulting, Las Pegasus’ leading families have also left us in something of a bind.

The Confederacy, for better or worse, was always going to have to deal with its Northern neighbors and former comrades at some point. In an attempt to avoid the inevitable conflict and revanchism that comes from bad blood, the Southerners approach the winners of the great schism with an offer of friendship.

The South is seperate from Equestria, and must seek its future as its own nation. That nation would like to be friends, maybe even close allies, but never again will Southerners be a part of Equestria. The name is chosen out of nervousness by its writers, for they know this will not be received gladly even by friendly northerners."

No matter what they might wish were true, they cannot live in the world before the schism. The South left, and only by self-defeating force of arms can they bring it home again. Guaranteeing the rights and freedom of the states, as the Confederates have suggested, will ensure that at least North and South can part as neighbors and comrades. It is the best course of action.\n\nThe treaty’s ratification is met with jubilation in the cities of the confederate states, where the growing concern about northern interference in their newfound independence had been festering.

The southern ponies may have tamed and gentled the land, but they did it with Canterlot’s guidance and blessing, Manehattan’s tools, Baltimare’s manpower and ships… The point is that there is no ‘North’ and ‘South’ in the eyes of Canterlot’s masters. There are only those who understand reality, and a bunch of dewy-eyed, slackjawed fools who think they can just make a country out of tumbleweeds and spit.\n\nThe Southern delegation is sent packing, and there is civil unrest in Hoofington and Appleoosa as citizens panic at the thought of an imminent northern invasion, one that they cannot possibly hope to survive."

The world has changed, and with it changes what is and is not essential. A hundred years ago, the oil in the states wasn’t worth that much. Nowadays it is absolutely vital for everything from industry to defense.\n\nThe northern victors need that oil. Everyone does. Why waste valuable resources to obtain it, when the Confederates are willing to offer Favored Nation status and increased trade in oil in return for a little peace? What’s the harm? And in return, maybe a few… consumer goods?"

Few can resist the magnet pull of the black gold and however attractive owning it directly might be, not having to spend a red cent on bullets to acquire loads of it at cheap prices is too good a prospect to pass on.\n\nThings may change if Equestria can find new avenues to secure its oil, but its inability to do so (and perhaps even a genuine hope for peace!) is why it signs. The South is pleased, knowing that as Equestrian magnates pull oil out of their ground, truckloads of consumer goods, raw materials, and vital food supplies pour into the Confederacy in return."
 scs.42.a:0 "Black gold!"
 
 scs.43.t:0 "Talks Break Down"
 scs.43.d:0 "The Southern effort to buy peace and better trade terms with its oil break down as tempers flare around the negotiating table in Canterlot. The southerners see this deal, cheaper oil for low tariffs, as perfectly reasonable. The northern ponies see it less as a gentlestallion’s deal and more as highway robbery by a pack of cowards and traitors. Why should they bargain for oil that, in their minds, is theirs by right? Who said these upstarts had the right to claim it in the first place?\n\nWhile there’s no open talk of war, this chilly reception has certainly dampened many hopes for peaceful co-existence among the confederate populace. Whosoever rules from Canterlot in a very real way dictates the jig the continent dances too, and this particular hoedown may not have room for them."

 scs.44.d:0 "The Confederates have sent a delegation to Canterlot, this time with a surprising proposal. In the past, many southern ponies pointed to the lack of direct royal involvement as one of their grievances against central rule. Now, independant southern ponies arrive suggesting that the Princess at last tour her former domains, this time not as a sovereign but as a visitor.\n\nThey promise luxury, but also a full tour of all the good to be seen. On one hoof, this is a good way to promote peace between two potentially hostile nations. On the other, it’s also a good way to show Canterlot that there may be more value in an independant but built-up south than an integrated but empty one."

Fears of imminent revanchist invasion, blockade, or the civil war spilling into their lives evaporate as she descends with a smile. She waves, and they cheer as if they never left the principality.\n\nThe message is clear. The bad blood between crown and confederate may not be totally forgotten, but it is as good as forgiven. They may not be Equestrians, but they are all her little ponies just the same. Her visit is a blessing to all, and she is free in expressing her admiration and pride in their hard work in such a difficult era.\n\nShe does not necessarily approve of everything they’ve done, however, and does say so when prompted by reporters. But her tone is always conciliatory. She looks forward to the day when strong bonds once again characterize ponies across the continent, from snowy Stalliongrad to the jungles of Hoofington."

There are flashing cameras everywhere, and the President and a few legislators greet him in a muted but still dignified ceremony.\n\nThere’s an odd air over the whole event. To ask with hat in hand for a royal visit of good faith and harmony only to receive a relatively unimportant official is… a bit frustrating. Despite the Confederacy’s efforts, Equestria signals brazenly that it will never see its unwanted neighbor as anything other than troublesome foals playing in their annoying sandbox. Adding insult to injury, the dignitary in question is an absolute bore, putting even the most hardened civil servants to sleep."

 scs.47.d:0 "The delegation to Canterlot proposing a royal visit as part of the ongoing diplomatic rapport between the Confederacy and Equestria has returned in disgrace. They were, and they do stress this quite literally happened, laughed out of the palace. Canterlot has stated in no uncertain terms that outside of the legitimacy-starved wetdreams of a few southern crackpots, the only reason that a sitting Equestrian monarch would step hoof in their dirty cities was as a conqueror. Or perhaps in charity, when they run their own economy straight into the ground.\n\nThe states have lodged a diplomatic complaint for how their ambassador was treated, but the response from the north has been stony at best. The legitimacy that could have been imbued by such a visit has turned into a bitter embarrassment for the fledgling nation, and not a good sign for its future security with such a neighbor."

But it ain’t true that we are cowards, or that we abandoned anypony. Our rights are sacred, but more sacred is our honor. The land that sheltered ponykind, where our ancestors first came together, is under attack from forces dark an’ terrible, and we ain’t gonna stand for it to fall. The guns of the south are comin’, by harmony they are, and if that won’t do it we’ll show ‘em how you take back a country for good!’\n\nThunderous applause meets this. Even the staunchest and most conservative of Confederates approves--independence is one thing, but ponies have always been slow to abandon each other entirely, after all. Old habits die very hard.

Nothing charges like an angry southerner.\n\nDetermined to tip the northern war in favor of Equestria, Southern volunteers and even a few outfits of regulars pour into the country, crossing the border to link up with beleaguered Equestrian units all across the front. Never again will they let northerners call them cowards. They’ve got nothing but targets, bullets, and true beating southern hearts! Stand fast, stallions of Apploosa!

While the Changelings are mainly concerned with conquering and controlling the north, their final victory over Equestria and its partisans will only free their forces up to march south.

The earlier decision to censor or spare his supporters is impossible now--you can only censor and proscribe when the movement is small, and now the words on every single pony’s tongue is the same--Rockhoof can Save Us.\n\nRockhoof is a brilliant, rich, ruthless pony. His scruples are few and his enemies have all been bought off or know they can never have justice. If the law helps him, he’s for the law. If it hinders than he throws it out. The only thing that matters to Rockhoof is results.
