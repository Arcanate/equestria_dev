### events ###
 civwar.2.t:0 "The South Rises!"
 civwar.2.d:0 "Patriotic, hard-working folks of the South have risen in defence of their homes, forming the basis of Confederate military."
 civwar.2.a:0 "Thanks y'all!"


 scs.1.t:0 "Confederate Chairman Elections"
 scs.1.d:0 "Ever since the turbulent Declaration of Secession, Chairman Silverstar has valiantly lead us through those trying times. With situation stabilized somewhat, the Chairman agreed to hold elections for the highest state position, himself running as a candidate. However, while for some his victory may seem certain, radical Confederate Defence League has been consolidating its support base, while the moderate Friendship-Union Party and its prodigy candidate Braeburn have ran a campaign promising a truly democratic state for all species. With the election day drawing near, emotions are running high, and the winner is uncertain."
 scs.1.c:0 "Defence League's candidate Beuford wins!"
 scs.1.b:0 "Silverstar gets reelected!"
 scs.1.a:0 "Braeburn wins by a thin margin!"

 scs.2.t:0 "Minutepony Volunteers"
 scs.2.d:0 "While we have managed to form a Militia, huge numbers of patriotic ponies have decided that they can provide support in defence of their homes. They have begun banding into informal defence groups, calling themselvse Minuteponies - ready to fight at a minute's notice. While they do not have official state support, they pledged their lives for the Confederation and the Southern Way."
 scs.2.a:0 "Three cheers for our Minuteponies!"
 scs.2.tt:0 "Spawns §YSix Minuteponies Volunteer Divisions§!"

 scs.3.t:0 "Confederate Coast Guard"
 scs.3.d:0 "Southern ponies have never been great sailors - with boundless plains and endless deserts filling in for the sea. However, due to the current situation, a creation of an ad-hoc Coast Guard has been approved. While small and composed of jury-rigged ships, this may be a beginning of a true navy."
 scs.3.a:0 "I wish I was in Appleloosa!"
 scs.3.tt:0 "Spawns §Y2 Destroyers§!"

 scs.4.t:0 "Confederate Constitutional Convention"
 scs.4.d:0 "As the internal and international situation has stabilized, it is time to formallize our laws and codes into a grand Constitution, preserving the rights of ponies of the South."
 scs.4.a:0 "The South rises!"

 scs.5.t:0 "Private Aviators"
 scs.5.d:0 "Many wealthier farmers are using aeroplanes for agriculture purposes. With their way of life endangered, they have pledged their machines to amateur pilots. While inexperienced, they certainly do not lack in enthusiasm!"
 scs.5.a:0 "Watch your head!"

 scs.6.t:0 "The Confederation wants us to join them"
 scs.6.d:0 "The newly formed Confederation of South States considers our lands an integral part of their country. We know that they have no love for Buffaloes, but maybe we will be stronger, if we bury the war axe and unite in friendship under one banner?"
 scs.6.a:0 "Let us become friends."
 scs.6.b:0 "They do not have good intentions toward us."

 scs.7.t:0 "Buffalo Tribes refuse our proposal!"
 scs.7.d:0 "The savage Buffaloes have refused our proposal of returning our land! This is a disaster for the ruling Chairman [SCS.GetLeader], with Southern Defence Party quick to capitalize."
 scs.7.a:0 "There is nothing we can do."
 scs.7.b:0 "To Tartarus with negotiations, this is our land!"

 scs.8.t:0 "Strike the Buffaloes?"

 scs.8.a:0 "Attack now!"
 scs.8.b:0 "We need to prepare first."
 
 scs.10.t:0 "The Confederate States Returns To The Fold"
 scs.10.d:0 "With the accession of the Loyalist "Equestrian Sun Party" to power, the ponies of the South have formally requested to rejoin Equestria. It seems that independence only served to allow the rich and powerful to trample on the rights of the little pony, rights that we had strenuously protected. Crowds of cheering ponies celebrated the passing of the Bill to dissolve the government of the SCS and re-absorb it into Equestria."
 scs.10.a:0 "A heartening sign!"
 
 scs.11.t:0 "The Confederate States Asks For Subregion Status"
 scs.11.d:0 "With the accession of the Loyalist "Equestrian Sun Party" to power, the ponies of the South have formally requested to rejoin Equestria as an autonomous region. It seems that independence only served to allow the rich and powerful to trample on the rights of the little pony, rights that we had strenuously protected. Crowds of cheering ponies celebrated the passing of the Bill to rearrange the Confederate government into a part of the Equestrian state."
