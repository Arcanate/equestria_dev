CYA_stamp_out_dissent_desc:0 "Spies, traitors, and perhaps the worst of all, communists, are prevalent in our cities and they must be rooted out if we wish to keep control over the important areas of our country.

CYA_the_generalissimo_desc:0 "General Raaf Cipres is right. Despite their political deadlock, the minotaurs will unite against us once they hear of our looming invasion plans. If we cannot control our own countryside, how will we control an entire island full of hostile bulls? The only rational choice is to fortify and await the storm."
CYA_requisition_firearms:0 "Requisition Firearms"

CYA_army_intelligence_division:0 "The Army Intelligence Division"
CYA_army_intelligence_division_desc:0 "Obtaining any information on the minotaurs' plans is already difficult due to the dividing sea. A special group will be formed to obtain the required intelligence, as well as root out any spies and dissenters that are undoubtedly crawling everywhere."

CYA_police_the_outback:0 "Patrols in the Outback"
CYA_police_the_outback_desc:0 "Controlling the bull hordes is certainly not an option. What we can do, however, is increase our presence in areas that contain vital mineral riches, and force captured minotaurs to work for us. Should they refuse, we got a quick solution to that as well."
CYA_military_training_exercises_in_the_outback:0 "Outback Training Exercises"
CYA_military_training_exercises_in_the_outback_desc:0 "While our troops are keeping in good shape and know how to operate their weaponry, they still require some actual combat experience. The hostile outback becomes a boon, for once, as we can "simulate" attacks on minotaur forces. The cows' consent is not required in this matter, of course."
CYA_the_kustenschutzwand:0 "Build the Küstenschutzwand"
CYA_the_kustenschutzwand_desc:0 "This is our most ambitious project yet - the Küstenschutzwand. Every mile of our coast will be covered in fortifications, mines will be placed in the sea, heavy guns will be installed in the batteries, barbed wires - anything and everything that will contain the invasion."
CYA_admiral:0 "The Admiral"
CYA_admiral_desc:0 "Ali d'Argento, our most senior admiral, has the right idea on dealing with the minotaur threat. We shall rally our troops, repair our ships, and stage the most glorious invasion of the Asterion archipelago. Only by breaking them before they can stage their own assault, we can ensure the continued peace."
CYA_requisition_landing_craft:0 "Requisition Landing Craft"
CYA_requisition_landing_craft_desc:0 "To carry our forces towards Astarion, we require far more convoys than we currently own. Our first priority shall be obtaining a sufficient number of them, as well as producing landing craft for the beach assault."

The Countess is confident in our success, although it should be noted that if the war drags on for too long, we will face insurrection from the native bull scum. The plans are put into motion, either we return as victors or we do not return at all. For glory!"

CYA_economic_shock_therapy_desc:0 "With our existance secured, we shall now look into resolving the economical matters. While Cyanolisia certainly can't be called poor or illiterate, we have not taken advantage of our position. Establish trading routes across the entire southern Griffonia! This will give us the means to propel ourselves forward."
CYA_look_to_the_empire:0 "Look to The Empire"
CYA_look_to_the_empire_desc:0 "Our obvious ally is the Griffonian Empire with which we've lost contact so long ago. Let us begin by sending an envoy to Griffenheim and inform them of our situation."

No matter; the jewel that is Thymíaustadt is worth more than the rest of Cyanolisia combined. We should now sue for peace, so that we may at least have a chance of holding onto our dear capital even if it means losing the rest of Cyanolisia to the damnable Minotaurians - not that the interior, with its infestation of bull savages, meant much to us anyways!"

CYA_minotaurian_outback:0 "The Hostile Outback"
CYA_opened_outback:0 "The Minotaurians' Outback"
CYA_opened_outback_desc:0 "Following the Communists' successful victory in the uprising against the military junta, the Cyanolisian Outback, once hostile to any griffon who strayed from the safety of the coastal towns, are now starting to be opened up to reclaimation and development. With a substantial majority of the Minotaurian indigenes supporters of the Communist cause, cadres from Thymíaustadt are now able to build infrastructure and make use of the natural resources in the Outback without fear of coming under attack by indigene partisans. With the opening up of the Outback comes the institutionalisation of the indigenes' legal and environmental rights to their lands and the resources within, affording them legally-recognised and unquestionable, if somewhat lessened from before, autonomy over the Outback. We can now also rely on the support of the Minotaurian indigenes in the event of an invasion, since they will now fiercely defend their hard-earned rightful lands alongside their Griffon brethren from the towns."
CYA_minotaurian_indigenes:0 "Minotaurian Indigenes"
CYA_minotaurian_indigenes_desc:0 "When the lands now comprising the County of Cyanolisia were stripped from the Asterion Republic and reorganised into an Imperial colony, the indigenous Minotaurian population was forcibly displaced from the lucrative coastal trading towns into the undeveloped outback. The result was that outside of the coastal towns the population was Minotaurian-majority. Barred from entering any of the towns but given free rein over the wild interior, these indigenes scattered, forming various tribes and factions. The outback is a hostile place to any Griffon, as the authority of the Imperial court ends at the borders of the coastal towns. Governance is hard because of the suppressed yet unruly Minotaurian population, which outnumbers the total Griffon population ten to one. Many Minotaurs in Cyanolisia long for reunion with the mother country across the channel."
