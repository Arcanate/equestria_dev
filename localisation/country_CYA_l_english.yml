CYA_coastal_railway:0 "Build the Coastal Railway"
CYA_coastal_railway_desc:0 "The first step in furthering our meagre industrial base is to connect our coastal cities by a modern railway. Transportation of goods and griffons will become much safer and quicker, no longer troubled by the marauding bulls."
CYA_coastal_towns:0 "Develop the Coastal Towns"
CYA_coastal_towns_desc:0 "There is plenty of unused land available for construction of new factories, military bases or simply more homes for our people. We should purchase this land for our future projects."
CYA_manufactory:0 "Satellite Manufactories"
CYA_manufactory_desc:0 "The city of Thymíaustadt is our most prized jewel, certainly, but we cannot develop it exclusively at the expense of others. See to it that our other coastal cities of Salmarkt and Auropallieta, as well as the satellite town of Tarmuth, receive funding for their new industrial designs as well."
CYA_arsenal:0 "The Tarmuth Arsenal"
CYA_arsenal_desc:0 "Cyanolisia lives and dies based on its firearms. For a long time, we could not produce new weaponry or even purchase from abroad. Now, however, we can correct that, and dedicated firearm factories will ensure every soldier has their gun."
CYA_company:0 "Support the Horst Trading Company"
CYA_company_desc:0 "We have come to rely on a number of trading companies that have set up their base of operations in our prized cities. The largest and most profitable of these, the Horst Handelsunternehmen, can offer us just what we need, for some concessions and funding. We'd be wise to become their patron."
CYA_town_stuff:0 "Sponsor the Auropallieta Dockyards"
CYA_town_stuff_desc:0 "To protect our homeland from the hated minotaurs, we must expand our existing naval capabilities, so that we can construct more ships and screening vessels. This will come at the expense of other opportunities, but it is the grim reality."
CYA_town_stuff2:0 "Sponsor the Port of Salmarkt"
CYA_town_stuff2_desc:0 "Although Salmarkt has only recently been passed to our care, its location has been very profitable for our trading business. Nogriff can object towards having more money, and thus we shall expand the shipping capabilities of the Salmarkt port."
CYA_town_stuff3:0 "Horst Oil Refineries"
CYA_town_stuff3_desc:0 "The Horst Handelsunternehmen has come up with a yet another brilliant idea for solving our lack of strategic resources - synthetic oil and rubber refineries. By using only a small portion of the actual resource, we can ease the demand and produce decent replacements. All they ask in return is a plot of land and a cut of the profits."
CYA_industrialise_fragrantharbour:0 "Develop Thymíaushafen"
CYA_industrialise_fragrantharbour_desc:0 "The Thymíaustadt harbour could use an expansion. We have already located good areas to build new wharfs, piers and docks. We only need to start working."
CYA_steelworks:0 "The Thymíaustadt Steelworks"
CYA_steelworks_desc:0 "Steel is a vital resource for the production of almost everything we require, be it buildings or weapons. As such, it would be prudent to expand our existing steel mills into something that can produce an actual difference for the state."  
CYA_outback_oil:0 "Oil In the Outback"
CYA_outback_oil_desc:0 "The griffons are rightfully frightened of the outback, but we cannot completely ignore it. A rather bold surveyor has located oil deposits in the jungles of Cannabia, and its location is relatively easy to access and protect from the cow tribals. Every bit helps, certainly."
CYA_special_industry:0 "Cannabia Special Industries"
CYA_special_industry_desc:0 "Would you look at that. Following our success in securing the oil well, we have uncovered a deposit of rare magical crystals. While we currently do not have a practical use for it, we know plenty of others who do, and would pay a pretty coin for them. A factory will be opened to process this new resource, as well."
CYA_griffon_institute_of_science:0 "Naval Institute of Science"
CYA_griffon_institute_of_science_desc:0 "The researchers are promising great advancements, but their facilities and funding are insufficient for their grand designs. Given their previous successes, we see the merit in their plea. The results will quickly follow."
CYA_industrial_stuff:0 "Steelworks Expansion"
CYA_industrial_stuff_desc:0 "The new steelworks are already producing much, helping our efforts, but there is more we require than just plain steel. Set up additional plants for the processing of the more rare metals."
CYA_industrial_stuff2:0 "The Thymíaustadt RADAR Tower"
CYA_industrial_stuff2_desc:0 "The splendid new invention called RADAR will change much in the future of warfare. After all, knowing where the enemy is at all times is an invaluable knowledge, and we should aim towards improving this technology."
CYA_industrial_stuff3:0 "Construction R&D"
CYA_industrial_stuff3_desc:0 "There is more to building a house or digging a mine than just raising support beams and ensuring the floor is even. Yes indeed, we shall aim towards combining our existing building methods with modern tools and vehicles. It will considerably improve our progress."
CYA_industrial_stuff4:0 "The Bright Future in Science"
CYA_industrial_stuff4_desc:0 "Despite our many difficulties in achieving progress, our hard work has paid off and now we reap the benefits. Our griffons are brighter and more productive by the day, and this is reflected in the increased amount of population capable of handling more demanding tasks. Three cheers for Cyanolisia!"

This was ten years ago, when Asterion seceded. Today, with modern salvaging techniques at our disposal, we can attempt to refloat the sunken battlecruiser, which will make a fine addition to our fledging navy."

CYA_comission_on_minotaurian_affairs_desc:0 "A special organisation will be formed in order to effectively deal with the minotaur threat. They have our blessing and consent to ensure peace and stability reigns in what little land we effectively control, and perhaps they will be take the fight towards the tribal bulls as well."
CYA_armaments_effort:0 "Armaments Effort"
CYA_armaments_effort_desc:0 "The means of increasing our military power are sorely lacking in Cyanolisia. Thus, it is imperative to turn around this situation."
CYA_fortification_effort:0 "Fortification Effort"
CYA_fortification_effort_desc:0 "From now on, a majority of our production will be devoted towards building up our defences. It is the only way we can survive."
CYA_stamp_out_dissent:0 "Stamp Out Dissent"
CYA_stamp_out_dissent_desc:0 "Spies, traitors, and perhaps the worst of all, communists, are prevalent in our cities and they must be rooted out if we wish to keep control over the important areas of our country. Perhaps a vacation in the countryside with the bovine beasts will teach them a lesson."
CYA_control_the_press:0 "Gag the Press"
CYA_control_the_press_desc:0 "We cannot let the newspapers and other media write what they want. Sooner or later, they'll leak crucial information of our plans and who knows what will happen once the hornheads find out. The press must write only what we tell them to write."
CYA_protection_troops:0 "Form the Schutztruppen"
CYA_penal_bataillon:0 "Form the Strafbataillons"
CYA_penal_bataillon_desc:0 "Deserters, thieves, murderers - little more than a drain on our society. Instead of languishing in overcrowded prisons, they shall redeem themselves on the battlefield. In victory, or in death."
CYA_military_police:0 "Form the Militärpolizei"
CYA_military_police_desc:0 "The Militärpolizei will be formed to keep order at home and in foreign territory. Additionally, they will ensure our troops do not succumb to any excesses."
CYA_coma_battalions:0 "Form K.f.d.M.G. Battalions"
CYA_the_generalissimo:0 "The Generalissimo"
CYA_the_generalissimo_desc:0 "General Raaf Cipres is right. Despite their political deadlock, the minotaurs will unite against us once they hear of our looming invasion plans. If we cannot control our own countryside, how will we control an entire island full of hostile bulls? The only rational choice is to fortify and await the storm."
CYA_requisition_firearms:0 "Requisition Firearms"
CYA_requisition_firearms_desc:0 "We find ourselves in a critical lack of firearms. We shall send traders to neighbouring cities to purchase rifles. Until we can build up our industry, this will fulfill our needs for now."
CYA_imperial_advisors:0 "Invite Imperial Advisors"
CYA_imperial_advisors_desc:0 "Our contact with the Heartlands is limited, but we could be able to convince some of their expert military minds to take residence in our lands, to train the troops and observe the looming war. Their assistance will be generously compensated."
CYA_fortify_thymiashafen:0 "Fortify Thymíashafen"
CYA_fortify_thymiashafen_desc:0 "Thymíaustadt is our most valuable city and the centre of almost every industry and production in our nation. Should we lose it, the war will be lost already - and the minotaurs know this. It shall receive the strongest defences we can muster."
CYA_army_intelligence_division:0 "The Army Intelligence Division"
CYA_army_intelligence_division_desc:0 "Obtaining any information on the minotaurs' plans is already difficult due to the dividing sea. A special group will be formed to obtain the required intelligence, as well as root out any spies and dissenters that are undoubtedly crawling everywhere."
CYA_protected_supply_lines:0 "Protected Supply Lines"
CYA_protected_supply_lines_desc:0 "The army marches on its supplies, this is known, but our logistical department is non-existant. Not to mention that indigenous minotaurs occasionally strike at our convoys, making the task of resupply quite harder than it already is. Regardless, we shall focus our efforts in improving the supply situation."
CYA_police_the_outback:0 "Patrols in the Outback"
CYA_police_the_outback_desc:0 "Controlling the bull hordes is certainly not an option. What we can do, however, is increase our presence in areas that contain vital mineral riches, and force captured minotaurs to work for us. Should they refuse, we got a quick solution to that as well."
CYA_military_training_exercises_in_the_outback:0 "Outback Training Exercises"
CYA_military_training_exercises_in_the_outback_desc:0 "While our troops are keeping in good shape and know how to operate their weaponry, they still require some actual combat experience. The hostile outback becomes a boon, for once, as we can "simulate" attacks on minotaur forces. The cows' consent is not required in this matter, of course."
CYA_the_kustenschutzwand:0 "Build the Küstenschutzwand"
CYA_the_kustenschutzwand_desc:0 "This is our most ambitious project yet - the Küstenschutzwand. Every mile of our coast will be covered in fortifications, mines will be placed in the sea, heavy guns will be installed in the batteries, barbed wires - anything and everything that will contain the invasion."
CYA_admiral:0 "The Admiral"
CYA_admiral_desc:0 "Ali d'Argento, our most senior admiral, has the right idea on dealing with the minotaur threat. We shall rally our troops, repair our ships, and stage the most glorious invasion of the Asterion archipelago. Only by breaking them before they can stage their own assault, we can ensure the continued peace."
CYA_requisition_landing_craft:0 "Requisition Landing Craft"
CYA_requisition_landing_craft_desc:0 "To carry our forces towards Astarion, we require far more convoys than we currently own. Our first priority shall be obtaining a sufficient number of them, as well as producing landing craft for the beach assault."
CYA_naval_intelligence_service:0 "Form the Naval Intelligence Office"
CYA_train_the_troops:0 "Train the Troops"
CYA_train_the_troops_desc:0 "As we find ourselves in a pressing need for more soldiers, a realisation has come to us that military training takes longer than it should. It will have to be reformed and stripped only to the essentials, in order to have a large standing army."
CYA_naval_auxiliary_patrol:0 "Form the Naval Auxiliary Patrol"
CYA_ignore_the_outback:0 "Cordon the Outback"
CYA_ignore_the_outback_desc:0 "Everything we require is located in our splendid coastal cities. No longer shall we trouble ourselves by attempting to control vast swathes of land populated by unruly, hostile minotaurs. We are focusing on the coast, entirely, from now on."
CYA_the_first_blow:0 "The First Blow"
CYA_the_first_blow_desc:0 "We've done all we could to prepare for the naval invasion. The Countess is confident in our success, although it should be noted that if the war drags on for too long, we will face insurrection from the native bull scum. The plans are put into motion; either we return as victors or we do not return at all. For glory!"
CYA_what_to_do_with_minotauria:0 "Woe to the Vanquished"
CYA_what_to_do_with_minotauria_desc:0 "By the Gods, we have been victorious! Against all odds our forces have struck the bulls a decisive blow, and they've sued for peace quickly afterward. The question remains how shall we control these subjugated lands. The Countess will deliberate with her command staff."
CYA_loot_the_cities:0 "Loot the Cities"
CYA_loot_the_cities_desc:0 "We finally have the means of exacting vengeance in our claws. The riches of Asterion will belong to us now, to assist in rebuilding our nation and further development. Let the hornheaded beasts fight over the remainders."

CYA_fortify_western_border:0 "Fortify the Western Border"
CYA_fortify_western_border_desc:0 "The Sicamese alliance with the bulls is a well known fact in international diplomacy. Rational concerns have been raised about the possibility of them working together against us. While we cannot completely prevent the chance of a two front war, we can dissuade them from launching major assaults by raising a series of fortifications on the western border."
CYA_economic_shock_therapy:0 "Economic Shock Therapy"
CYA_economic_shock_therapy_desc:0 "With our existance secured, we shall now look into resolving the economical matters. While Cyanolisia certainly can't be called poor or illiterate, we have not taken advantage of our position. Establish trading routes across the entire southern Griffonia! This will give us the means to propel ourselves forward."
CYA_look_to_the_empire:0 "Look to The Empire"
CYA_look_to_the_empire_desc:0 "Our obvious ally is the Griffonian Empire with which we've lost contact so long ago. Let us begin by sending an envoy to Griffenheim and inform them of our situation."

No matter; the jewel that is Thymíaustadt is worth more than the rest of Cyanolisia combined. We should now sue for peace, so that we may at least have a chance of holding onto our dear capital even if it means losing the rest of Cyanolisia to the damnable Minotaurians - not that the interior, with its infestation of bull savages, meant much to us anyways!"

CYA_minotaurian_outback:0 "The Hostile Outback"
CYA_opened_outback:0 "The Minotaurians' Outback"
CYA_opened_outback_desc:0 "Following the Communists' successful victory in the uprising against the military junta, the Cyanolisian Outback, once hostile to any griffon who strayed from the safety of the coastal towns, are now starting to be opened up to reclaimation and development. With a substantial majority of the Minotaurian indigenes supporters of the Communist cause, cadres from Thymíaustadt are now able to build infrastructure and make use of the natural resources in the Outback without fear of coming under attack by indigene partisans. With the opening up of the Outback comes the institutionalisation of the indigenes' legal and environmental rights to their lands and the resources within, affording them legally-recognised and unquestionable, if somewhat lessened from before, autonomy over the Outback. We can now also rely on the support of the Minotaurian indigenes in the event of an invasion, since they will now fiercely defend their hard-earned rightful lands alongside their Griffon brethren from the towns."
CYA_minotaurian_indigenes:0 "Minotaurian Indigenes"
CYA_minotaurian_indigenes_desc:0 "When the lands now comprising the County of Cyanolisia were stripped from the Asterion Republic and reorganised into an Imperial colony, the indigenous Minotaurian population was forcibly displaced from the lucrative coastal trading towns into the undeveloped outback. The result was that outside of the coastal towns the population was Minotaurian-majority. Barred from entering any of the towns but given free rein over the wild interior, these indigenes scattered, forming various tribes and factions. The outback is a hostile place to any Griffon, as the authority of the Imperial court ends at the borders of the coastal towns. Governance is hard because of the suppressed yet unruly Minotaurian population, which outnumbers the total Griffon population ten to one. Many Minotaurs in Cyanolisia long for reunion with the mother country across the channel."
