## Electing a new Leader
penguin.1.t:0 "The Summit at Dachaigh"
penguin.1.d:0 "After almost 4 years in power, King Lolo is nearing the end of his lifespan. The particular breed of Penguin he belongs to is a short lived and weak one, but despite this Lolo has proved himself as an amazing and capable leader. Sadly, his time is fast approaching, and before he sets off to join our ancestors in the great beyond, he must first make a decision. Who shall rule after his death? King Lolo has produced no heirs, so he and his council must decide on who shall inherit the throne after he is gone."
penguin.1.a:0 "Show me the list of Candidates."

penguin.2.t:0 "The Candidates"
penguin.2.d:0 "The great list of candidates has been pulled out and shown to the council, and together they have decided on the best two candidates they could find. The first candidate is Hindrik Aberg, a relatively young penguin hailing from the Nithean province. The second candidate is Orvar Njordin, a radical from the inner city of Dachaigh. "
penguin.2.a:0 "Show me more about Hindrik Aberg."
penguin.2.b:0 "Show me more about Orvar Njordin."

penguin.3.t:0 "Hindrik Aberg"
penguin.3.d:0 "Hindrek Aberg was born in the Nithean province to a small noble family, he recieved the best education he could possibly get, even being sent to a school in the Crystal Empire to get his education. Your council members inform you that he is a rather hopeful and naive penguin, believing in the Equestrians ideal of peace and harmony. "
penguin.3.a:0 "He shall be the new King."
penguin.3.b:0 "Bring me the list again."

penguin.4.t:0 "Orvar Njordin"
penguin.4.d:0 "Orvar Njordin is a rather peculiar choice from the council. He is an excellent statesmen and has brought prosperity to the city of Dachaigh many times by introducing new reforms and such, on the downside he is perhaps one of the most radical penguins in the kingdom. He has been seen attending fascist groups, a recent thing in Dachaigh, and has even been heard saying rather racist remarks regarding the Polar Bears and even the Griffons."
penguin.4.a:0 "He shall be the new King."
penguin.4.b:0 "Bring me the list again."

##For Stalliongrad
penguin.5.t:0 "Message from Pingland" 
penguin.5.d:0 "A diplomatic request has arrived from the Democratic Republic of Pingland, far in the north. They seek to ally with us, to be better protected. They also state that together we can better defend and fight against the Griffons and other threats to Communism in the north."
penguin.5.a:0 "A wonderful idea, we shall accept!"
penguin.5.b:0 "No."

## Responses
penguin.6.t:0 "Stalliongrad Accepted!" 
penguin.6.d:0 "We recieved a message from Stalliongrad, and they have accepted our request."
penguin.6.a:0 "Excellent."

penguin.7.t:0 "Stalliongrad Declined." 
penguin.7.d:0 "Sadly, we have not recieved any message back from Stalliongrad. It is assumed they have declined."
penguin.7.a:0 "Damn."
