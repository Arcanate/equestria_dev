MAZ_destroyed_army:0 "Annihilated Army"
MAZ_destroyed_army_desc:0 "Only a few years ago, Mazwi had a large army that was in the progress of modernizing. This army was used to secure control of the entire Great Lakes region and was largely funded by the wealth of the gold mines and by taxing the provinces. But when the Storm King came, he shattered the army in a single decisive battle using his airships. As he then proceeded to pillage the region, what remained of the army either defected, were slain by provincial revolts or were sold into slavery. Now, nothing remains of our once mighty military."
MAZ_gold_mines:0 "Gold Mines of Buckure"
MAZ_gold_mines_desc:0 "The hills of Buckure contain some of the largest gold deposits in the entire world. Mines have existed there for centuries, owned by the royal family of Mazwi, and their wealth was used to catalyst Mazwi into greatness. While there is less and less gold mined every year, whoever owns the mines can easily become rich."

great_lakes.1.t:0 "Buckure Gold Mines Depleted"
great_lakes.1.d:0 "Production of gold in the Buckure mines had been steadily reducing year by year, but at least the miners kept finding new deposits underground. This year, however, there's been no such luck. Any new veins of native gold discovered are not economically worthwhile to mine, as the content of gold in the ore is so low. The rivers flowing down from the hills, too, have smaller amount of gold dust in their waters. It seems like the gold mines of Buckure, renowned throughout the world, have finally been thoroughly emptied.\n\nWhile mining operations in Buckure will continue, we can no longer expect large quantities of gold to come from there. At best, there might be an occasional golden nugget, but nothing more."
great_lakes.1.a:0 "The fountain of wealth has dried up."
