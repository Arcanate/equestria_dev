When there was finally a moment of calm she slunked back into her office outside of the main compound for some peace, quiet, and maybe a cup of tea.\n\nBut when she entered she new something was not completly correct.\nNo. Something was definitely wrong.\n\nThat paper was somewhere else. And there were already cups of tea prepared.\n\nGrabbing a pistol from a secret drawer she held it out at the chair at the other end of the room, turned to face the back of the tent which had been rolled up to served as some semblance of a window. How had someone gotten in? The door had been locked hadn't it? As she did this the chair turned around...\n\n"Now now general, we are not enemies here." The bat in the seat spoke "We both with for the victory of the Lunar cause, and for a home for the bats in the south-east. And I have a way that this can be achieved.\n\nThey talked for hours, about the bat's plans for dividing the lands amongst bats and natives, to let bats from across Equus migrate into a land that belonged to their race alone. And when he had left the general was not yet fully convinced, but wrote down his information on a pad of paper.\n\nStarry Glory.\nNut job.\nHas enough resources that he could be useful.\nInteresting ideas if nothing else."

He would get an extra ration when they got back to camp. For now though, she had to speak with the Coltec ambassitor. He was at the negotiating table representing not only his own tribe, but all those with a grdge against the Neighua. A tribe of natives who revered the sun in a cult like manner, and had always been hostile to the nocternal bats, calling them "tlacatecolotl" or "demons" and always fighting against them.\n\nThis anti-Neighua league, called the "Bond of Nine Sisters" would hopefully, after today, include a tenth.

The civilized and the tribal made into one in order to serve the great Empress.\n\nAnd so as the night went on, the talks turned away from official business into chats between friends. Drinks were had, bats had fun and eventually after they all woke up in the wrong rooms, treaties were signed.\n\nOverall a productive meeting."

The day where the army camp had been amnushed.\n\nIt started like any normal day with drills, food, and preparing to move out to garrison positions on the perimiter. Then someone saw a guard go down, not with the loud burst of a gunshot, but with the light pop of a blowdart.\n\nNeighua.\n\nBut then also came the roaring of guns and hidden mortars, no, he Neighua couldn't do this alone. This was a full Celestial attack.\n\nThe Soldiers scrambled around the camp trying to throw together a defense against the celestial forces breaking through the outer defense lines, but it was near no use. As bats and pegasi clashed in the skies, while native allies on both sides battled in the adhawk trenches that had been dug the day before regements tried to form for counter-attacks. Command decended into madness as all of a sudden all orders from high command, or any central officers cut off.\n\nBut soon the soldiers would know why.\n\nIt started when a mixed bat-coltec plantoon would look up from their bloody hole in the ground and see the command staff, lead personally by Stars Whirl herself, with pistols, grenades, and even chair legs in hand charging down the front of line towards the celestial mortars.\n\nOne of the Coltec let out a great cry, "Tlayacatia yoac!", meaning "They lead in the night". With this the platoon got up and followed the command staff in the charge, who had made a desperate choice after their main command tent had been hit by concentrated artillery fire. They knew they needed to break it or the entirity of Lunar army command in the south would be lost.\n\nAs the reckless charge grew closer to the main celestial line more weakened platoons began to join them, until they turned into a wave of blood and iron that shocked the Celestial and Neighua until they enterd into a retreat.\n\nBut the moment that would be the most remembered was documented by a single soldier, who after being approached by a newspaper journalist named Light Narrative, he would tell them this tale; \nWhen my company was almost entirely dead, I didn't know what much else to do, then I heard charging from the hill tops and saw the generals who lead my army, but that I had never seen, charging head first into the fray. But while I was looking I got hit in the shoulder by shrapnel and was knocked to the ground. Next thing I know I'm being patted awake, and when I opened my eyes, I saw the Marshal herself who said to me,\n\n"Hey wake up, we have an army to burn.""

And one of the Primary demands of the batpony tribes was setting this grudge straight.\n\nAnd so for the whole war, the lunar military had been fighting with one hand tied behind its back. Planning the revenge of the tribes. They would strike at the holiest temple of the Neighua, and desecrate it forever.\n\nAnd so, when the Neighua went at sunrise to preform their rituals, sacrificing a pile of fruits, since Celestia had benned their practice of sacrificing non-believers, they were ambushed by hordes of tribal bats who at once decended on the crowd, not killing them, but dumping onto them a mixture of berries and fruits used in traditional batpony rituals that the Neighua considered the stuff of demons and nightmares. It drove them into a frenzy, fleeing from their temple while being persued by Lunar military forces. In the chaos Night Guard commandos infiltrated into the Neighua villages and found out who was working with Celestial operatives. They would meet the bullet later.\n\nBut for now, the bats would have be content with humiation of their greatest enemy. As they saw their great temple go up in flame, emiting a deep purplish-black smoke caused by the fruit compote. The Neighua, would not be so cocky after this."

As all of the voters arrive there seem to be two contenders eeeking our ahead of the others.\n\nFirst, you have Starry Glory. A leader of one of the main paramilitary groups in the south-east before the civil war, he has now made an effort to attempt to lead it. He is clear who his administration is for, the thestral and only the thestral. This is favored by many of the more extreme representatives from the Lunar Empire proper but has been railed against by the chief diplomat of the Coltec tribe who sits on the voting council from Aztlan, and even some of the Lunar Empire officals, such as the General Bipen who worries about the instability his policies could cause. He also seems to have some sort of relationship with the general, though no one is sure what it is exactly.\n\nOn the other hoof, is the journalist Light Narrative, famous for being an early public supporter of Nightmare Moon's early thestral campaign that was so supressed by her sister, and then being a supporter of the Lunar revolt to serve as a way to advance the status of all the creatures of Equus. He also reported from the front lines of the war in the south-east bringing grueling tales of war and death, and most famously a tale about the great general Stars Whirl herself. Seeing the blood and conflict he has taken a conciliatory attitude towards the native peoples of the south-east but he has stated he will not fail to build a home for thestrals as well under his leadership.\n\nAnd as the council seems divided, her vote may sway others in their choice.\n\nWho does she choose?"

The Dr. escapted while we overran his state and now he tries to ferment another uprising.\n\nBut this shall be different then the first time we took him now. For now, our leader is not afriad to hold any punches.\n\nAs the natives seemed ready to storm the city from the small thestral garrison that still held the walls, charges went off from in the crowd. Only flashbangs but still enough to startle and shock. This broke the cohesion of the formerly organized crowd and caused it to split. Some ran forwards ready to take the walls, with others dispursing back into the forests. But as soon some of the natives hit the walls. Starry have the order. "This was reason enough", he would state the next day at a press conferance, for him to order the thestral units, conviniently hidden in the shrub of the forest to fly out and unleash on the crowds with a hail of fire, with death tolls not yet released. The regements would only fire once, but the haos was enough and the natives ran in all directions.

The Neighua leaders have called a "Council of the Sun" to "plan peaceful resistance". And since this is clearly a cover for planning further terror atacks like the ones at Tenochtitlan, we shall use this supposedly secret council to snatch up all of their leaders and make them dissapear.

He concluded that due to the prevelance of the sun in Neighua mythos, that their arch-rivals the Coltec developed to see the moon as their guardian.\n\nHe believes that if the Governate lent its support to these groups, and assisted them in speaking out about their Lunar worship, that many tribes could be brought around to being voluntarily loyal to the Governate.

One is the famed Dr. Caballeron, and one is the half mythical, half real story-book author Daring Do.\n\nShe shocked Equestria by coming out to lead the Celestial revolt against the Lunar military in the south-east, but eventually lost and went into hiding with some other followers. But when the governer was elected she decided to come out again and actively resist our rule. Well. It is time to show her that kindness does not mean in-action. A warrent shall be put out for her arrest.\n\nSecond, getting back to the esteemed doctor. He turned himself in after the election of the new governer dclaring that he "Didn't want a manhunt that could hurt people". For this most agree he shall be granted a pardon, as long as he doesn't do anything else against us. There has even been a consideration of offering him a position in government, to use his credability with the natives to boost the security of our rule.\n\nAnd then the third issue, other minor chiefs have not been so ameanable. We have a list of the most fierce opponents of our regime in order to arrest them. Thoughw e should take clear to not appear completely hostile."

Their solar worshipping ways go directly against the Lunar empire, and something must be done about them soon lest they pose a greater threat in the future. Many generals are advocating for simply pulling the trigger, but Narrative explains that such a reversal of course would cause the natives to never trust them in the future.\n\nInstead it is time to employ his old tactics. Talking to people and trying to understand where they are coming from.\n\nThough this time it is much harder. The negotiations with the chiefs of the Neighua ended in tense standoff until an agreement was finally settled on. That would allow the Neighua to continue their beliefs, but only within their Temple of the Sun, which will be placed under government surveilance at all times.\n\nWhile this deal really makes no one "happy", it hasn't made anyone angrier, and will hopefully serve as a first step towards something bigger."

supporters.21.d:0 "In order to secure the rule of law in our nation, and to ensure that the rebelious elements within our nation are kept under control, martial law shall be declared indefinitely. This shall surely allow citizens to feel safer as they sleep at night, knowing that the punishment for every crime is a bullet to the head. And now, we can make A LOT of things crimes."

supporters.22.t:0 "The Lunar Military Frontier"
supporters.22.d:0 "The streets of Baltimare were lined with troops and military vehicles as a parade of soldiers began to move towards the newly renovated town hall of the city, which had been remade into part fort, part halls of goverment to serve as the seat from which General Stars Whirl governs.\n\nThe soldiers were all dressed in flashy uniforms of the Empress's personal guard, and the elite commandos of the Night Guard. ALl to signify that these were the servants of state, no stuffy bureaucrats or boring lawyers.  That these colts and mares would serve as the new force of order in the south-east.\n\nThe day culminated with a grand speech by the Grand Marshal of the nation, declaring unending loyalty to the Empress of the Night, and that her loyal military would always govern these lands to protect against "Those solarists and subversives who would dare to threaten her just reign".\n\nIt ended with thundering applause from every thestral in the crowd and even many non-bats, but those who still remembered the communest of Baltimare kept thinking what could have been..."

supporters.23.t:0 "Forging An Economy"
supporters.23.d:0 "With our status in the empire made clear, we must now focus on how to go about developing our economic power, to be of better use to the Empire at large.\n\nOne option is to take what makes this land an inhospitable nighmare and make it something great! By using the jngles we can harvest precious natual resources of which we can use to power further economic growth. The rudder of the jungles and the gemstones of its mines can, and will serve us well if we invest into them and can guarantee income for our state. Though this may keep us from having a large industry.\n\nThe second path follows that od industrialization. The city of Baltimare, once simply a large fishing village was a great project embarked on by the Equestrian government to turn it into a hub of industry on the coast in the South. We can pick back up these various prjects to produce more manufactured goods for the empire, though this would draw us away from the riches found in the jungles."
supporters.23.a:0 "The wealth of the jungles must be exploited to its fullest!"
supporters.23.b:0 "We must focus on building up the cities!"
