### Decisions Categories ###
BAL_PRO_army:0 "The Changeling Garrison"
BAL_PRO_army_desc:0 "We are surrounded by enemies on all sides, the only thing keeping order in this mosquito infested hellhole are the brave changelings of the Südöstliches §GGarrison§!.\n\nUnfortunately for us, we are on the very edge of the Changeling Empire and as such the garrison receives little to no support from the Fatherland.\n\nThe §GGarrison's§! size is at §Y[?BAL_changeling_garrison]%§!"
BAL_PRO_resistance_d:0 "The HMCMDR"
BAL_PRO_resistance_d_desc:0 "Unlike our General Staff's initial predictions it seems as if the Ponies have not been fully cowed by their defeat in the Great War. As such many of them have taken to joining the newly formed §RHMCMDR§!.\n\nThis clandestine organisation; comprised of a myriad of scattered Resistance groups and rebel cells seeks to overthrow the Protectorate's rightful government and restore Equestrian rule to the South-East.\n\n§RHMCMDR's§! power is at §Y[?BAL_resistance]%§!"
BAL_PRO_natives_d:0 "The Natives"
BAL_PRO_natives_d_desc:0 "The §RNatives§! of the Equestrian South-East have proven surprisingly resistant to our rule. While primitive and uncivilized they are masters of guerilla warfare and as such make any changeling think twice before going into the Protectorate's jungles.\n\nThankfully for us the §RNatives§! are far too scattered, diverse and disorganised to even be capable of posing a threat to the Protectorate's Government.\n\nThe §RNatives'§! organisation is at §Y[?BAL_natives]%§!"
