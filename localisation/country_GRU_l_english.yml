GRU_the_riaporto_congress_desc:0 "To break through the political stalemate plaguing the free towns of Gryphus, Chairgriffon de Viartorré has convened the congress. Representatives from all corners of Gryphus are flocking into Riaportu. Many citizens hope for a democratic transition, but the strong military presence of the Opinicus Order and the sheer lobbying power of Gryps-Süd GmbH may overcome the voice of the people."
