GRU_the_riaporto_congress:0 "The Riaportu Congress"
GRU_the_riaporto_congress_desc:0 "To break through the political stalemate plaguing the free towns of Gryphus, Chairgriffon de Viartorré has convened the congress. Representatives from all corners of Gryphus are flocking into Riaportu. Many citizens hope for a democratic transition, but the strong military presence of the Opinicus Order and the sheer lobbying power of Gryps-Süd GmbH may overcome the voice of the people."

GRU_the_economic_debate:0 "The Economic Debate"
GRU_the_economic_debate_desc:0 "To say that the economy of Gryphus has been focused on the coast is an understatement. The traders of the coastal merchant cities control most of the wealth. The representatives from the interior have urged us to develop their lands as well to lessen the economic disparity within the country."

GRU_the_linguistic_debate:0 "The Linguistic Debate"
GRU_the_linguistic_debate_desc:0 "One of the clearest dividing lines in the nation is the issue of language. In these lands the knights speak Herzlander, the city-dwellers Sicameonese and the locals Gryphussian. Concerns have been raised if the nation needlessly handicaps itself by only treating Sicameonese as the language of the government. Should provisions be made for other languages as well?"

GRU_power_of_knights:0 "The Power of the Order"
GRU_power_of_knights_desc:0 "During the Congress, grandmaster Weissfisch of the Order of Ophinicus has been fervently arguing on the order’s behalf. As it is, they are a mighty force, but the Grandmaster argues the order could become unrivalled if given the backing to do so."

GRU_power_of_traders:0 "The Power of the Company"
GRU_power_of_traders_desc:0 "The Gryphusische Südkontinent-Gesellschaft has been a force in the region ever since it first arrived. Enormous wealth has flown through its claws and will continue to do so. There are those, however, who argue that the company is too powerful and should be checked, pointing out that the company doesn’t have a history of settling for what it has."

GRU_power_of_freetowns:0 "The Power of the Free Towns"
GRU_power_of_freetowns_desc:0 "The Free Towns may have started out as just a bunch of small towns meant to host GSG trade outposts but over the centuries they have grown to be much more. The question has been raised if these towns should be given greater autonomy to actually become 'free' as the name suggests."

GRU_the_company_takes_over:0 "The Company Takes Control"
GRU_the_company_takes_over_desc:0 "Recent events in the Free Towns have not turned out to the liking of the board. We must remedy this situation and take a more active role in managing our assets; this is what happens when you rely on the public sector."

GRU_the_council_holds:0 "The Council Remains in Power"
GRU_the_council_holds_desc:0 "Despite some hiccups along the way, the Free Towns have remained under the Council's control. With any gray areas clarified and any possible legal troubles pre-empted, it is time to roll up our sleeves and see about building something resembling an actual nation."

GRU_the_knights_resurgent:0 "The Order of Opinicus Resurgent"
GRU_the_knights_resurgent_desc:0 "For too long the order has been left to rot away in the outskirts of the region, never being given the status it should have. No more, it's time for these trinket peddlers to be brought to heel and a new order to rise. For the grandmaster and for the Order!"

GRU_naval_1:0 "Screening Vessels Development"
GRU_naval_1_desc:0 "We are a nation rooted in trading and escort ships are our navy’s bread and butter. Modern ships, however, require more than just cannons. Fortunately we have contacts back in old Sicameon that can help us acquire more modern vessels."
GRU_naval_2:0 "Ship-of-the-Line Development"
GRU_naval_2_desc:0 "Sometimes, you must project greater force than your enemy. Contacts in Rottendedam have acquired blueprints for vessels that can outgun any Zebra pirate or Cyanolisian freebooter that wishes to challenge us."
GRU_naval_3:0 "The Pythagoros Naval Institute"
GRU_naval_3_desc:0 "They say it takes 300 years to build a naval tradition and the Free Towns have been here even longer than that. Between all the smugglers, pirates and ‘honest seafarers’ around, our nation has plenty of knowledge available, and our Admirality has the wherewithal to make use of these experiences."
GRU_naval_4:0 "Submersible Development"
GRU_naval_4_desc:0 "If all other ways to compete fails, it helps to stop your competitor’s goods from reaching their destination. These new ships move underwater and strike without being detected. Used correctly, they offer immense value for the money."
GRU_naval_5:0 "Heavy Dreadnought Development"
GRU_naval_5_desc:0 "Some would call the investment excessive, but, even if we do not buy them it is clear others will. We will not be second rate."
GRU_naval_6:0 "The Shipyards of Pythagorea"
GRU_naval_6_desc:0 "Buying ships is inherently uneconomical. With large scale investments into the Pythagoros dockyards, we will begin creating a Rottendedam of the south!"
GRU_aerial_doctrinal_reformation:0 "Aerial Doctrinal Reformation"

GRU_aerial_2:0 "Light Fighter Development"
GRU_aerial_2_desc:0 "If we are going to make use of the sky, we must first control it. Light, agile fighter planes will be the best bet to make sure that we, not our foes, dominate the air."
GRU_aerial_3:0 "The Loulé Aviation College"
GRU_aerial_3_desc:0 "If Gryphus is to have a proper air force we must invest. Having recruited veteran air pilots and engineers from all over Griffonia, we are going to establish what hopefully, one day, can be one of the premier institutes for the study of aeronautics."
GRU_aerial_4:0 "Medium Aerofighter Development"
GRU_aerial_4_desc:0 "Tactical bombers and Heavy Fighters will take our air force from our own airspace into the heart of the enemy’s, letting us strike everything from Falcor to Nimbusia if we would need to."
GRU_aerial_5:0 "Heavy Aerofighter Development"
GRU_aerial_5_desc:0 "We could fight the enemy at the fronts, or we could fly over their heads, blow up the factories that produce their weapons and then strike."
GRU_aerial_6:0 "The Airfields of Gryphus"
GRU_aerial_6_desc:0 "With airfields established both by the coasts and inland, the know-how to build and to fly as well as a young, but budding tradition of flight, Gryphus is now poised to become a real air power. As the locals say: "Do Nieba!" "
GRU_army_doctrinal_reformation:0 "Army Doctrinal Reformation"
GRU_army_doctrinal_reformation_desc:0 "It used to be so simple: hire mercenaries, give them some baselines and then you had an army. Modern times demand more than this, however, and it is time to lay the foundation for a true army."
GRU_army_1:0 "Infantry Weapons Development"
GRU_army_1_desc:0 "Firearms technology has never progressed quite as fast as nowadays and we will not be left in the dust."
GRU_army_2:0 "Landcruiser Development"
GRU_army_2_desc:0 "Reports from the north talk of new weapons: vehicles fitted with heavy armor and cannons. Already the empire has created entire units around these \"tanks\" and we have gotten the chance to acquire blueprints for these weapons. We can’t pass up this opportunity"
GRU_army_3:0 "Mechanised Troops Development"
GRU_army_3_desc:0 "If you can transport cargo in it, you can transport people in it. This is true of ships and is is true of trucks. The end result is both quite logical and very fast."
GRU_army_4:0 "Magitech Rifles Development"
GRU_army_4_desc:0 "The latest and most exciting development in the field of weaponry is magical firearms. These weapons may be primitive right now, but that’s only all the more reason to get in on this early!"
GRU_army_5:0 "Support Companies Development"
GRU_army_5_desc:0 "No griffon who knows what they’re talking about think that warfare is just about griffons with guns. Modern warfare needs much, much more, and that’s all the more reason to get in on researching and designing the best support gear we can."
GRU_army_6:0 "Forest Fighters"
GRU_army_6_desc:0 "Most of our lands are forested and it is a disgrace that we have not truly made use of this fact. Our forces can’t sit around at the coasts only: it is time for the Gryphussian soldier to become the master of his homeland’s terrain."
GRU_military_shared_1:0 "Developing a Marine Corps"
GRU_military_shared_1_desc:0 "Our military can fight on land and it can fight at sea. It is time to combine these two things and create a force that can strike from the water towards land wherever we need them to."

While they have retained their Griffish title as an homage to their Herzlander roots, they no longer have any overlord to keep them in check and have exploited southern markets without anyone to stop them. They profited greatly from exporting Prywhenian rice and were blamed by some to have caused the famine that followed.

The State agricultural farms themselves prove to be extremely inefficient. Collectivization and persecution of private farmers, on whom quotas were enforced, is leading to a collapse in agricultural production.

Focus on quantity instead of quality means we make a lot of shit. The new factories we have built have not replaced old ones which continue being used. Heavy industry focus comes at the expense of everything else and our economy is suffering. Consumer goods are lacking in quality though our guns are good."
