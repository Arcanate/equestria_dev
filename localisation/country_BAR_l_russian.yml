barrad_silver_star.1.d:0 "Наш Магистрат Сильвер Стар известен своей властной над ним паранойей. Однако, похоже что всё хуже чем ожидалось, ибо он не может успокоиться даже во сне.\n\nМаг выбежал из своей комнаты в безумии, крича так громко как он мог о ужасах которые он видел. Когда слуги смогли прижать его, Магистрат продолжил бредить о побеге от ужасающих монстров которые хотят разорвать его в клочья. Затем он сказал об видениях его союзников которые доставали клинки и резали его множество раз, выкидывая его высушенную оболочку где-то в лесу\n\nСлуги пытались его успокоить, но всё бесполезно. Сильвер Стар поднялся и стал обходить коридоры, приказав усилить охрану у его спальни и слугам быть настороже каких-либо убийц. Затем он закрылся в своей спальне и стал похаживать вокруг да около, рассуждая о предателях и шпионах."

BAR_silver_hides_in_the_corner:0 "Поиски Сильвер Стара"
BAR_silver_hides_in_the_corner_desc:0 "Все приготовления перед охотой прошли гладко, и все были готовы - все, кроме Сильвер Стара. Мага-параноика нигде не видать - Граф быстро выпустил Асинти и Леопольда чтобы найти Сильвера и закончить его игру в прятки."
BAR_viira_focus_on_important_things:0 "Дело Величайшей Важности..."
BAR_viira_focus_on_important_things_desc:0 "Её Магистрат Виира известна за её упрямость и самолюбие, однако, она также амбициозна и одержима. Если убедить её выйти из башни и забыть об её эго, Пентархия будет намного веселее!"
BAR_put_an_effort:0 "...Подумав Ещё Раз"
BAR_put_an_effort_desc:0 "После бесчисленных провальных попыток вытащить олениху из башни, Виира своими действиями сказала что ей нечего делать снаружи. В последней попытке Амброзий предложил информацию о культах взамен на выход из башни. После неловкого молчания Виира вышла и сказала: "Теперь я заинтересована"."
BAR_produce_guns:0 "Производство Оружия"
BAR_produce_guns_desc:0 "Его Магистрат Леопольд очень сдержан, часто просиживает дни в своей башне, вдали от внешнего мира. Однако, как грифон из Герцланда он имеет хорошие знания об современном вооружении. Он послал предложение Графу сделать кучу пушек. Граф принял запрос в нетрезвом состоянии и одобрил его даже не читая что там."
BAR_produce_magical_guns:0 "Эксперимент С Кристаллами"
BAR_produce_magical_guns_desc:0 "Годами Леопольд пытался закончить свой проект, "кристальную винтовку", ружьё способное стрелять от магии вместо пороха. К сожалению ему никогда не удавалось довести идею до идеала - до настоящего времени. Недавно леопольд показал Графу своё изобретение, жестоко уничтожив его передний дворик вспышкой магического света."
BAR_produce_more_guns:0 "Будущее Производство Оружия"
BAR_produce_more_guns_desc:0 "Леопольд послал ещё один запрос на оружие. Граф получил его в довольно трезвом состоянии (в этот раз), так что он решил: чтобы не получать личные запросы он приказал построить оружейную у восточной реки. Граф поздравил себя за его гениальную идею, после чего выпил 5 пинт пива."
BAR_gather_peasants:0 "Собрать Крестьян"
BAR_gather_peasants_desc:0 "Лидеры Баррада получили много внимания - к сожалению, негативного. Дюжины приключенцев входят в наши земли чтобы уничтожить печально известную Пентархию. Пришло время расправиться с этими "героями" - мы призовём на службу новобранцев-крестьян из деревней Баррада чтобы побороть иностранцев, даже если нам придёт выгонять их из домов своими силами." 
BAR_borrow_peasants:0 "Одолжить Крестьян"
BAR_borrow_peasants_desc:0 "После набора Баррадских крестьян, Его Магистрат Асинти вежливо попросил одолжить парочку для продвижения его эксперимента. Мы с радостью дадим ему что нужно чтобы иметь более лучшее коллективное понимание о мире в котором мы живём, и больше."
BAR_gather_nobles:0 "Собрать \"Аристократов\""
BAR_gather_nobles_desc:0 "По Барраду разбросаны поместья самых богатых пони - эти "аристократы" почти ежедневно устраивают вечеринки с Графом и занимаются тёмной магией. Они контролируют взносы которые могут быть полезными в решении наших проблем, а так как они ещё и пьяницы то всё должно пройти без трудностей." 
BAR_hunting_party:0 "Команда Охотников"
BAR_hunting_party_desc:0 "Мы вооружили наших охотников и рассказали им наш план, мы провели великий пир чтобы воодушевить наших союзников. Настало время найти всю дичь скрывающуюся в наших лесах.\n\nДа начнётся охота!"

BAR_elisay_valley_factories_desc:0 "Elisay Valley’s high and resource rich peaks make it less affected by Barrad’s infamous weather, and a considerable source of the nation’s ore and crystals. Together, these traits make the valley a prime candidate for a new industrial park."
BAR_elisay_valley_terraforming:0 "Терраформириование Долины"
BAR_elisay_valley_terraforming_desc:0 "In the dark ages, our ancestors were limited by the land around them. With projects to clear otherwise unusable terrain being extraordinarily expensive and time consuming. Now, with the power of industry to assist us, we can do in months what may once have taken years to accomplish."
BAR_alchemy_plantations:0 "Алхимические Плантации"
BAR_alchemy_plantations_desc:0 "Agriculture! This is the foundation on which civilization is built.

BAR_sentient_livestock:0 "Разумный Скот"

BAR_new_mine_desc:0 "Barrad's land houses a cornucopia of crystals. We must extract as much of them as possible. To do so, we will establish new mines and excavate them by any means necessary. Soon the riches deep within these lands will be ours."
BAR_mining_eq:0 "Шахтёрское Оборудование"
BAR_mining_eq_desc:0 "There exists many fundamental truths in this world. The sky is blue, water is wet, and steel is stronger than stone. We’ll need new equipment to prove that last one."
BAR_leopold_research:0 "Изучение Кристаллов"
BAR_leopold_research_desc:0 "With such an abundance of crystals now at our disposal it would be a shame to have very narrow uses for them. Леопольд has already discovered many practical uses for the magical gems, in his spare time but a dedicated team would undoubtably find even more. The only issue is funding such a team."
BAR_industrial_eq:0 "Промышленное Оборудование"

barrad_first.1.d:0 "Deep in his study on a stormy night, Count Ambrosius paced in candlelight, dictating a letter to an enormous seated griffon. "Dear friend," began Ambrosius. "I extend to you an invitation to attend a great celebration. The most esteemed creatures of the land will be in attendance, and together we shall witness amazing wonders, the likes of which have never before been conceived!" Just saying the words made Ambrosius hop in excitement. "Come to my manor at once so that we may begin the festivities. Your friend, Count Ambrosius I." The griffon struggled to keep up with Ambrosius' words, scribbling as fast as he could onto a piece of parchment. "Oh this will be fun. So fun!" laughed Ambrosius.\n\nThe griffon finished writing and looked up to Ambrosius. "Who should receive this message?" The Count stood still, not acknowledging the question at all. "The Pentarchy?" asked the griffon.\n\n"Pentarchy. Pentarchy..." Ambrosius stared off into nothingness, trailing off for a moment. "Well, we simply must have Viira. Her extraordinary talents will help us greatly." Ambrosius tapped his chin. "And Leopold. To deny our party a mind like his would simply not do at all! He shall be there. Silver Star, on the other hoof..." The Count's face twisted in disgust. "Very rude guest. We could do without him. And... what was that old zebra's name again?"\n\nThe griffon unhooked a vial of liquid from around his neck and offered it to Ambrosius, who greedily took a swig. The Count blinked several times before glancing around the room."Thank you, Gąsienica." He sighed and sunk into a chair. "Yes. Send it to the Pentarchy.""

barrad_first.4.d:0 "The Count rose before the nobles and other Pentarchy members gathered in his manor. He began to speak, thanking them all for their presence. He gleefully told them of the great hunt that he had arranged. The nobles were ecstatic and pressed the Count to tell them more. He told them that there was much game in the woods, and that it was only increasing in number.\n\nHe then announced in a loud voice, “And so, dear friends, it is time to poach this game, in a grand hunt!” Speaking in a softer tone, he said, “But before the hunt can begin, we must first feast to prepare our spirits for such a spectacle. Today, you will see before you the most exquisite food and vintage drink that I could produce. Let us dine, then, to our health, and to glory!”\n\n“To glory!”, exclaimed the nobles, who quickly set about to devouring the food brought before them, before downing it with copious amounts of wine and beer.\n\nAs the Count prepared to dine, Silver Star nervously asked to be excused. The Count reluctantly allowed him to go, before returning to his meal and mug."
barrad_first.4.a:0 "A truly excellent feast!"
barrad_first.5.t:0 "The Hunt"
barrad_first.5.d:0 "The day after the feast, the Count rallied the hunters. He distributed high-grade weapons, produced in Leopold’s forge, he then told them about the game they were to find. With all of the Pentarchy members arriving in the space of a few hours, the hunting party, numbering about a hundred members, set out from Ambrosius’ manor. They began to trek into the woods, killing any lone adventurers and small bands they found, as well as a few unfortunate peasants. They went on for hours killing over a dozen ponies and griffons in the woods and putting their bodies in a wagon that Asinti ordered be dragged along with the party. Even Silver Star, in spite of his nervous disposition, was able to kill a few adventurers, for which he was lauded by his allies, especially Ambrosius.\n\nThe party had begun to turn back, when they heard a noise off to the side. The Pentarchy, along with a few dozen nobles went off to find out what the cause of it was, whilst the others guarded their bounty. When the expedition came to the source, they found a well-sized band of adventurers preparing to execute a small number of oddly dressed ponies. The expedition quickly cut down the adventurers and captured the robed ponies. They returned to the main party and continued back to the manor."
barrad_first.5.a:0 "What a great bounty indeed!"
barrad_first.51.t:0 "The Discovery"
barrad_first.51.d:0 "After sorting out their bounty, and having yet another feast, most of the nobles retired to their own estates, and the peasants were set free. The Pentarchy quickly assembled to address the elephant in the room, the captured ponies. Asinti pleaded for them to be given to him, to which Viira responded, “Don’t you have enough, doctor?” Ambrosius quickly silenced them before stating his own plan:\n\n“It is clear that we know very little about these strange ponies. I am dying to know more about them. I propose that we interrogate them, to find out who or even what they are.”\n\nThe other Pentarchy members nodded in agreement. The ponies were briefly interrogated, before they offered to show the magistrates their meeting place. The ponies showed the Pentarchy into a cave containing all sorts of mysterious inscriptions. It was rightfully assumed that these were members of some sort of ancient cult. The last thing the cultists presented was a series of runes that looked like instruction for some kind of device. The type of device was completely beyond the Pentarchy members, and even the cultists had little knowledge of it. Sated with this knowledge, the Pentarchy split up, with Silver Star racing back to his tower, Asinti and Viira engaging in a lengthy argument, Leopold trying to figure out how the device worked, and Ambrosius drinking a few pints of ale, before passing out on his throne."
barrad_first.51.a:0 "How... interesting."
barrad_first.6.t:0 "Finding Silver"
barrad_first.6.d:0 "After scouring through half of Elysium looking for him, Leopold got the brilliant idea to search Silver Star's tower. Upon reaching the tower, they were interrogated at length about their intentions. Half an hour later, they were let in. They entered the mage's room, only to find it empty. The two groaned and turned around to leave. They were walking past the large closet in the room when Asinti heard something.\n\n"Did you hear that scratching, Leopold? It sounded like it was coming from the closet. Surely he wouldn't"...\n\n"Where else would he possibly go?"\n\n"The bathroom, like any other sensible creature."\n\nAsinti burst the closet wide open to reveal a whimpering and petrified Silver Star. Silver fell out like a piece of timber, with Leopold barely breaking his fall. He set the unicorn down on the floor gently, and then walked over to Asinti.\n\n "How are we going to convince him to come with us?"\n\n"Don't worry, I've got this under control."\n\n Asinti proceeded to make loud sounds at Silver, telling hm about a terrifying band of cossacks in the woods that they were about to hunt and that the Count wanted Silver to lead the party. Leopold, witnessing Silver's increasing fear, pushed Asinti aside, and began to reassure Silver that there were no cossacks and that the Count only wanted to see him. Silver slowly got up and left with them, though very timidly. Asinti and Leopold followed, and the griffon loudly scolded Asinti for his poor behavior."
barrad_first.6.a:0 "Silver Star will remember that."
barrad_second.1.t:0 "Matters"
barrad_second.1.d:0 "In the study of Count Ambrosius, the other four members of the Pentarchy sat around a table, contemplating the strange events they had witnessed. "Since our brave Count is currently incapacitated, it is up to us to us to decypher the meaning of this." Viira placed the mysterious codex down on the table. "We need a plan of action," she said, glancing at each of her compatriots. Leopold paid her no mind, continuing to study the inscriptions he had copied from the cave. Asinti's eyes were closed and his head bobbed slowly. Was he sleeping? Silver Star scowled and grabbed the codex with his magic.\n\n"I am certain that one of the ancient books in my possession will have the information needed to understand these runes," said Silver Star, narrowing his eyes. "I would never allow any of YOU to get a peek at my library, though." He shifted his gaze around the room, suspiciously. "That would be unwise. Very unwise," he muttered to himself.\n\nLeopold waved a dismissive claw. "If we put our minds to it, we can figure this out on our own. No need for any of your obscure, dusty texts," he said matter-of-factly. Silver Star pursed his lips and pushed the codex back to the middle of the table.\n\n"That would take too long, Leopold. We have to go to the source of this." Viira tapped the codex. "We need to get in contact with the cult, so we can question them and find out more," she said. Her tone left no room for argument; it was clearly an order, not a suggestion.\n\n"No." A raspy voice arose. "I can hear their whispers." Asinti looked at Viira with wide eyes. "Yes, we should track down the cult. But not to question them, to kidnap them! Their sacrifice will please the ones beyond." His face broke into a wide smile. The other three eyed Asinti in silence."

Standing guard by the entrance, Gąsienica was ready to greet him. "Feeling better, sir?"\n\n"Yes, incredibly!" Ambrosius laughed and slapped Gąsienica's back. "You know, it's been so dull around here lately." He began trotting through the halls of the manor with Gąsienica keeping pace at his side. "But that party was invigorating. Hunting! Killing! Mystery! So much excitement..." Ambrosius stroked his beard in contemplation. "I know what we must do: throw another party, bigger and grander." The Count was positively giddy by the time he entered the throne room.\n\n"More drinking, more feasting, more merriment!" Ambrosius was smiling just imagining the festivities. "Begin preparations at once! Send out invitations to the Pentarchy, and all the nobles." He slowly turned to face Gąsienica, his smile remaining but his eyes becoming dark. "And make sure our guests know that refusing to attend will have severe consequences.""

barrad_second.3.d:0 ""You've never- Unbelievable! You simply must witness it," Ambrosius implored the group of nobles around him, before turning to wave across the hall. "Viira, care to entertain our guests?" he shouted. The doe sighed, and began to walk toward the balcony. Ambrosius galloped to join her and beckoned for the group to follow. From the manor's balcony the two looked over a nearby village, as well as the untamed forests and mountains in the distance. Ambrosius pointed to the village watchtower. "There, that's a good spot."\n\nViira focused intensely before closing her eyes. A strange energy could be felt in the air around her, and her Seer's robes began to ripple with magical power. Suddenly, a large section of the village surrounding the tower became shrouded in a dark fog. When the fog dissipated, everything that had been inside it was gone. "Spectacular!" shouted one of the guests, as the rest of them mumbled in amazement. "Where did it all go?" asked another.\n\nViira smirked. "A magician never reveals her secrets.""

barrad_second.4.d:0 "In a musty cellar, Viira stood surrounded by a wall of figures shrouded in shadow. In front of her was a hooded acolyte who seemed to be in charge of the others. The acolyte began some kind of short ceremony, before looking to Viira expectantly. "Did you devise these plans?" asked Viira, showing the instructions for the strange device.\n\n"No, they come from the master," answered the acolyte.\n\n"Master?"\n\n"You think Count Ambrosius is the master of Barrad? No, the true master lies hidden from the unworthy and undiscerning. It is our purpose to serve It, for we have done so for countless generations." The acolyte lowered her head. "But we have failed. It has become angered by the greed and cruelty of the land, and unleashed the plagues that afflict Barrad. It is the cause of all our suffering.""

"Can I meet it?"\n\n"Only a privileged few can discern Its will, much less stand in Its presence. We are but the Outer Circle, and I have told you all that I can. If you wish to know more you must contact the Inner Circle."\n\n"I see." Viira bowed humbly.\n\n"When you are ready, seek them out." The acolyte held up a hoof. "But be prepared to prove yourself. Only those worthy are allowed to know the secrets they hold.""

barrad_second.6.t:0 "Descent"
barrad_second.6.d:0 "Deep into the night, Viira sat studying the codex, looking closely at its inscriptions and comparing them to every ancient script she had samples of. She sighed in frustration, yet another dead end. The runes were alien, but at the same time they seemed so familiar. There was still a missing piece to the puzzle. She needed answers, and so she took the codex and journeyed through the woods to return to the cave. At the entrance, she saw a solitary pony emerging from its depths. "What were you doing in there?" asked Viira.\n\nThe pony stopped in his tracks. "Just exploring," he answered. Viira examined him closely, there was something odd about him. He wore strangely fine clothes, and didn't seem very comfortable in the natural environment.\n\n"Anything inside?" asked Viira. The pony shook his head, agitated. "Is that so? Because I believe I've met some of your friends who would disagree." Viira took out the codex and showed it to the pony, whose eyes went wide in realisation. He became tense, silently staring at Viira. "Please, I mean you no harm. I just want to understand," she pleaded.\n\nThe pony scrutinised her for a long moment, before sighing. "We will be in touch. If you prove your intentions, you will find your answers." He trotted off into the forest without saying another word."

They are schematics for a device capable of producing vastly more energy than any existing power station," said Viira, giving her intrigued companions a conspiratorial glance. "It goes without saying that his device has enormous potential, it could give all of us the means to achieve our ultimate goals."\n\nLeopold raised his claw. "We must decode these schematics so that we can begin construction immediately. I shall begin preparation of the site: excavation will be no issue," he said, his artificial eye scanning the instructions on the table.\n\n"And I will be able to provide an ample supply of undead labour," Silver Star boasted, drawing a scoff from Leopold. "Insolence! You DOUBT my power?" Silver Star reeled, nearly falling out of his chair.\n\nAsinti interrupted, paying Silver Star no mind. "I will be happy to assist in this matter, but first I must heed the words of the ones beyond. They demand a temple, and so I must build one." He smiled serenely.\n\n"Fair enough," said Viira. "In the meantime I will attempt to track down any groups who may know more about the origin of these plans."IF AT LEAST ONE IS DEAD:The remnants of the Pentarchy have at last determined the meaning of the mysterious inscriptions discovered during Count Ambrosius' great hunt. They turned out to be plans for constructing a device capable of producing an enormous amount of energy. Building this device and harnessing its power has become the Pentarchy's foremost priority, and the process of fully decoding the schematics has already begun."

Eventually, he grabbed a photograph and held it up to show Gąsienica.\n\n"This is an automobile. It is a means of transportation, but it is also common for wealthy and powerful individuals to keep them as status symbols," Ambrosius explained. "I must have one. Contact a manufacturer and entice them to come to Barrad. I will acquire one of their vehicles to style and craft into my own." He tapped his hooves together rapidly. "Oh, I can picture it now!"\n\n"Right away, sir." Gąsienica nodded, rising to leave.

barrad_third.2.d:0 "Gąsienica rushed through the halls of Count Ambrosius' manor, making a beeline for the throne room. Upon entering the room, he rocketed towards the lounging Count, presenting a loose collection of papers. "Sir, I have received word that a grave threat has emerged and is attacking the mountain villages!" he blurted out, before stopping to catch his breath.\n\n"Ah yes, those reports of mutant plants near the southwestern border. A truly bizarre situation." Ambrosius took the documents and leafed through them, lazily. "Many griffons down there... that's near where you grew up, isn't it?"\n\n"Yes," said Gąsienica. "Are we going to do anything to help them?" There was obvious concern in his voice.\n\n"No need to worry, I've sent a letter to the Pentarchy." Ambrosius waved a dismissive hoof. "They can handle it. Probably. Do you know how they're doing? Are they all still alive?" The Count blinked several times before shaking his head vigourously. "In any case, I have asked them to look into this matter and resolve it. They'll get around to it when they can, and then this threat will be wiped off the map!"\n\nGąsienica frowned in response."

barrad_third.22.d:0 "In his personal quarters, Gąsienica was drafting a letter of his own to supersede the one the Count had already sent out to the Pentarchy. It had to be done; the members of the Pentarchy had many priorities, but the safety of the mountain villagers was certainly not one of them. "It is my understanding that Count Ambrosius recently requested that you travel to the mountains in order to address reports of aggressive vegetation," Gąsienica began the letter.\n\n"Disregard those instructions, and do not concern yourself in any way with this matter. I will attend to it personally." Gąsienica's claw trembled as he thought of the hardships being endured by the border villagers. "Those griffons are my kin, and this is something I must do myself. Your faithful servant, Captain Gąsienica." Upon finishing the letter, he sighed and clasped his claws together. It was done. All that was left to do was send it out and begin his own journey into the mountains."

"I humbly ask for your aid in my research, for I have no doubt that you all are the key to securing our future." The cultists listened silently, before conferring among themselves.\n\n"You wish to know the secrets of the Inner Circle," one of the figures said. Viira couldn’t tell which one. "Your reputation precedes you. But to know the nature of the gifts we protect, you first must prove your worth to us by completing the Trial.""

She navigated the treacherous path for close to an hour with only the light of the candle to guide her, before at last coming upon a conspicuous alcove containing an ornate lantern. She took the lantern, placing the candle inside it, before making the long trek back to where she had started.\n\nUpon returning, the acolyte rejoiced at the sight of her. "It is complete!"

She seemed to be in charge of all the other guards. "You're not from around here, are you?"\n\n"That is true. I was... compelled to come here and abandon my natural history studies in Aquileia." The griffon's eyes looked past Viira for a moment. "But it is here that I found my purpose, in the service of the Great Machine."\n\n"I have come a long way from my home, as well." Viira brought a hoof to her chest. "I hope that I may also find my purpose here."\n\n"That's all well and good, but you're still not getting in." said the griffon, unimpressed. Viira nodded and walked away.\n\n"

barrad_third.8.t:0 "Journey of a Thousand Miles"
barrad_third.8.d:0 "As he made the long and arduous trek over treacherous mountain paths, Gąsienica's mind was consumed by thoughts of his home. Distant memories from when he had lived there; memories of joy, innocence, and then the most intense fear. Back before he had been saved by Ambrosius... but now was not the time to dwell on that. Much more pressing was confronting the novel menace that threatened to destroy his kin.\n\nAfter emerging from a narrow pass, he at last laid eyes on his home village, only to see it besieged by an army of shambling trees. The villagers were mounting a stiff resistance, but clearly wouldn't be able to hold out for much longer. Gąsienica let loose a shout and charged towards the trees at full speed, slamming into them with all his weight and ferocity. Fighting using only his bare claws, he split trunks and ripped off branches with his incredible strength. The villagers were inspired by the show of bravery and pushed forward, cutting down the trees with their swords and axes.\n\nOne of the fighters chucked an improvised incendiary bomb into the cluster of trees, which exploded setting many ablaze. Frightened, the remaining trees ceased their attack and began to slowly retreat. "I said no fire!" a voice shouted. "Maniacs! Are you trying to burn the whole village down?" Griffons rushed to keep the flames under control, but the voice brought back memories for Gąsienica. It was a voice he had not heard in a lifetime."
barrad_third.8.a:0 "Could it really be, after all these years?"
barrad_third.81.t:0 "Find Your Way"
barrad_third.81.d:0 "Gąsienica waded through the victorious militia to find an old friend from his childhood leading them. "Jánošík!" he shouted, raising his claws high. "I hope you've been staying out of trouble!" Jánošík laughed and pulled Gąsienica in for an embrace.\n\n"I try my best," Jánošík said with a grin, drawing a sceptical look from Gąsienica. "Sure, occasionally I liberate a noble passerby from their wealth, but I never keep it for myself. It all goes to the people who need it most." Jánošík had to tilt his head up to engage in the conversation, such was the degree to which Gąsienica towered over him. "Say, I remember you being big, but now you're built like a tank! What's your secret?" Gąsienica frowned, remembering the many experiments Ambrosius had performed on him to enhance his physical performance. In the awkward silence that followed, Jánošík nervously tugged at the ornate amulet around his neck.\n\n"What's that?" asked Gąsienica, noticing it for the first time. "I never pictured you being very fond of jewelry."\n\n"This? Erm... it's just a trinket. Sort of a good luck charm." Jánošík gave a sheepish smile. "Silly, I know."\n\nA sharp gust of wind blew a branch from one of the slain plants onto the ground between them. Gąsienica picked it up to give it a closer look. "That's strange. These leaves look like the kind I use to make the Count's medicine." He took one in his claw to feel its texture.\n\n"We'll have more time for botany later, but right now I think we just made them angry." Jánošík looked towards the horizon. "There will be more of those things coming soon, and we need to prepare.""
barrad_third.81.a:0 "Sounds like we're not out of the woods yet."
barrad_third.82.t:0 "A Time for Heroes"
barrad_third.82.d:0 ""Gather 'round, everyone!" Gąsienica shouted as he stood next to a pile of nondescript crates. "We're going to need all the firepower we can muster to beat back these monsters. Fortunately, I came prepared." He kicked open one of the crates to reveal its contents: dozens of shiny new magical rifles. "Grab one, and take up a defensive position around the village!" The townsfolk did as they were told, and soon formed a makeshift skirmish line facing the approaching enemy. The shambling trees were slow to advance, but were coming closer and closer by the minute.\n\nWhen they came within range, the villagers began firing, their magical projectiles proving highly effective against the plant monsters. At the same time, Gąsienica charged out ahead, using his claws to rip the trees apart with reckless abandon. Jánošík was right by his side, felling many trees with his axe.\n\nDuring the fierce fighting, Jánošík tripped and became tangled in the roots of the slain plants, and the trees around him converged to finish him off. In desperation, he ripped the amulet off his neck and held it out towards the encroaching monsters, closing his eyes in anticipation of the killing blow...\n\nBut the blow never came. Sensing the magic of the amulet, they dared not come any closer to it. As the plants remained still, shots from the villagers and Gąsienica's devastating strikes shredded them. It did not take much longer for the remaining trees to be broken. Gąsienica, Jánošík, and the entire village stood victorious."
barrad_third.82.a:0 "Now that's what I call landscaping!"
barrad_third.83.t:0 "Journey's End"
barrad_third.83.d:0 "After fighting off all the attacking trees, Gąsienica sat recovering with Jánošík in his home. "I think it's time you explained what's really going on with that amulet," said Gąsienica. Jánošík nodded.\n\n"In the past, you may have seen a group of robed idiots scurrying around Barrad, raving about their god, who lives somewhere underground," began Jánošík. "A merchant I know works with them, gathering magical artifacts and the like. It's all supposed to go to the cult, but sometimes they offer some of it up for sale, and this particular item caught my eye. It's said to be imbued with magic that can scare away anything born from the cult's god." He held up the amulet. "Anything that could scare a god sounded pretty interesting to me. Of course at the time I thought that was all nonsense... but maybe those cultists were on to something after all?"\n\n"You know, I've learned a bit of magic in my time around the Pentarchy." Gąsienica examined the amulet closely. "I believe we can use this artifact to cast a warding spell that will make sure those things don't come back." Jánošík was intrigued, and watched as Gąsienica channeled the item's power into a spell. He could feel the magical energy in the air, and from Gąsienica's smile he knew the spell had been a success.\n\nAfterwards, the two went off to save the other mountain villages that were threatened, defeating any plants attacking them and casting the warding spell. After all the other villages were protected, they parted ways, and Gąsienica began his long trek back to Count Ambrosius."

barrad_third.10.d:0 "High in the mountains, Viira walked through a field of mangled plants. The ground was littered with twisted trunks and branches scarred by deep cuts and magical blasts, the bodies of trees which had only recently threatened to wipe the mountain villages off the map. Viira took a sample from one of the plants, tucking it away inside her bag, before heading towards the nearby village. As she approached the town she could sense a strange magic in the air. She questioned the villagers about the spell, and they pointed her towards the griffon who had cast it.\n\nViira tracked down the griffon, who was named Jánošík, and eagerly shook his claw. "Greetings, I am Viira." She smiled. "And I must say, superb work dealing with those nasty plants! May I ask you a few questions about how you managed it?" Jánošík clearly recognised her and scowled, remaining silent. "Now I know you may not be fond of the Pentarchy, but any information you can provide will help me get to the bottom of this matter, and ensure such a tragedy never occurs again," pled Viira.\n\nJánošík sighed, moved by her sincerity. "All right," he said, leading Viira to the location where he kept an ornate amulet. "This is it." Jánošík offered the amulet for inspection. Viira held it up and flipped through her codex, comparing the symbols inside to those adorning the artifact.\n\n"Interesting..." she marveled."

bar_pen_screen_silver_info_text:0 "Fear and desire. These emotions have come to define the life of the unicorn known as Silver Star. Originally he was nothing more than another arrogant scion of the Wittenland noble class. Scheming, somewhat paranoid, and jealous of those in a better position. In this case, it was jealousy directed at a sibling - Queen Whitestar of Wittenland, who managed, much to the dismay of Silver Star, to become the monarch of the realm purely through her magical talent.\n\nUsually, such nobles would remain in the background of important matters of the world, lacking in ability to fulfill their ambition. However, fate had other plans for Silver Star, for he would for one reason or other travel to the very borders of the Wittenland. Here Silver Star would learn why the griffons were such a threat to the creatures of the Riverlands. He would experience several raids by the griffon cossacks and would nearly perish during them.\n\nThe raid affected him greatly, and the culmination of these experiences were recurring nightmares of his untimely death. This pushed Silver Star into studying powerful magic, as one theme was present in all of these dreams no matter who slew him - a lack of power and inability to persist beyond the weakness of his flesh. He would become obsessed with his own mortality, and this led the unicorn down a very dark path, as no matter how much power and knowledge he acquired, the enemies in his nightmares persisted; unbeatable and impossible to endure as ever. And after reaching ones potential in raw magical prowess, there remains only one way to become stronger – by breaking the greatest of taboos in most magical societies. Thus, in an attempt triumph over all his perceived enemies, which Silver Star believed were circling him like vultures, the unicorn turned to dark magic.\n\nHowever, despite his ever increasing power, the safety that Silver Star desired seemed to be fleeting. His paranoia only worsened, as usage of the dark arts transformed his body and mind, forcing him into hiding as it became obvious to any magical creature that the unicorn was being corrupted by the darkness. And yet, for all this power, it was not enough. To Silver Star, his enemies were everywhere, simply waiting for a perfect moment to slay him. And for all this power, he was still unable to master death itself.\n\nWith these fears of demise and desire for power, it was no wonder that Silver Star was very willing to accept the invitation that was presented by Ambrosius. After all, even among the chaos of the Griffonian continent, few were as appreciative and accepting of the dark arts and their user’s talents. Furthermore, perhaps due to some remnants of his pride, Silver Star believed that Ambrosius, an earth pony, nor any of his allies and subordinates belonging to other races, were a danger to him, or at least Silver Star was unwilling to admit that.\n\nNow Silver Star spends his time studying any and all knowledge of unicorn magic that can be found. All in an effort to become so powerful that nothing would be able to hurt him, and death would never be able to take him."
bar_pen_asinti_info_text:0 "“The ends justify the means” is a very popular statement among many ideologues, especially those representing the more radical parts of the political spectrum. However, if one were to bring up the means that Asinti uses, many of these radicals would be horrified, and agree that, whatever the end goal is, there was no way what the elder zebra shaman was doing to be justified.\n\nOriginally, Asinti was nothing but another slave, a victim of the brutal institution that is still dominant in many parts of Zebrica. Many who experienced such fate would try enduring, if not resisting against their subjugators. Yet it seems that most lacked “strong spirit”, as in recorded history, Asinti has been the only zebra slave that was approached by a power from beyond the material realm. This ally from the immaterium helped Asinti to free himself from the shackles of slavery, slay his former owner, and flee from those who would persecute him, eventually reaching a country established by similar runaways.\n\nThe ideals of the Kasa Free State greatly inspired Asinti, as living among so many zebras, deer, and griffons that had fled similar fates and desired to end slavery and serfdom across the world, convinced the zebra shaman that maybe there is a way to do more than survive. His otherworldly ally, like always, was supporting and helpful, agreeing with the notion, and even suggesting a rather fascinating plan. According to the creature, Asinti was a very unique individual, with a spirit that burned like a roaring fire, allowing him to interact with the plane of the divine, and thus could be noticed by deities and spirits that resided there. Most other creatures lacked such a trait and thus lacked the power to liberate themselves. But what if they could somehow be connected to this realm of the divine?\n\nHowever, this was not such an easy task as no matter what Asinti tried, he could not find what exactly made him so special. As years and even decades went on, with increasing desperation from the increasing brutality of the modern world, and with the whispers from beyond always encouraging him, the zebra chose to employ more questionable methods in order to complete his research. Eventually Asinti would succeed, and rather than simply connecting to this plane, Asinti discovered a way to transfer the creatures of the immaterium into the bodies of living things. He saw it as the solution to the seemingly eternal struggle of Kasa, even if the methods leading to its discovery had been morally dubious. The leadership of Kasa reacted to revealed actions of Asinti with horror, and the zebra shaman was swiftly driven out of the country.\n\nWhile Asinti had many disagreements with other members of the Pentarchy, the Ambrosius’ proposal and access to all the magical knowledge and resources it brought was too good to pass up. After all, with these means the elder zebra shaman could now achieve the end he was striving for so long."
bar_pen_ambrosius_info_text:0 "Once a prominent merchant and artisan, Ambrosius lived a decadent life, constantly surrounded by luxury and wealth. His true goal however, joining the elite circles of the noble class, always remained out of his hooves, no matter how much he spent on lavish appearances and rare magical artefacts. To his peers in their lofty castles, Ambrosius would always remain a haughty upstart, grasping at something just out of reach.\n\nEventually Ambrosius would grow tired of conventional life. He retreated to his stately mansion in the Barrad countryside, away from the courtly intrigue of Wittenburgh, where he began unravelling the true mysteries of magic. Lack of progress drove Ambrosius to boredom, and he returned to his usual routine of courting local nobles. They were more receptive to his silver tongue, and even began to see Ambrosius as one of them, which would later become crucial. Rumors began to float that Ambrosius was engaged in acts of debauchery that would shame the most decadent of nobles, or that he conspired with malevolent spirits for a grasp at forbidden power. These rumors were ultimately dismissed as merely fever dreams and servant gossip, until it was too late.\n\nOne day, Barrad became wrapped in fog and storm, impenetrable to sight and body, nopony knowing what transpired for weeks until the mists cleared. As Wittenland's authority had become increasingly atrophied, Ambrosius had a free reign ruling over the blasted earth, the trapped ponies remaining as his playthings and subjects of experiments. Over time, he would invite like-minded creatures to join him in the pursuit for knowledge, without ethical strings attached. It would seem that Ambrosius was finally cured of his restless ennui, or so he convinces himself."
bar_pen_leopold_info_text:0 "The desire to help others is a noble one, especially when one wants to help potentially the entire continent, if not the world. It was this desire that would define the life of a griffon known as Leopold.\n\nLeopold was born and spent his early life in the Herzlands, the heart of the Empire, and of course, one of the most technologically and scientifically, at the time, advanced region of the world. Perhaps this is how the griffon managed to survive this long, though most agree it would be better if he perished as a young chick. For since his very first years, Leopold was a very sickly griffon, with only the best medicine available preserving his life.\n\nIt was this sickness and weakness which would accompany him his whole life, combined with his genius, that would define Leopold’s life goal, which to most would be quite unorthodox, to say the absolute least. For differently from most other great minds of Griffonia, even those from universities such as Gamia, wouldn’t think of such solution for biological issues. For differently from the students and professors of Yale, he believed that instead of relying on medicine or even biological modifications, it would be technological enhancement that would allow sickly and weak to survive and reach their potential. This belief was only reinforced as Leopold managed to somewhat alleviate his own condition by the usage of magical crystal injections and enchanted machines which assist his organs. Though these additions also had another effect of greatly increasing Leopold’s physical abilities...\n\nThis sidefect led to the first of many heavily unorthodox and to many unacceptable ideas that the griffon had to alleviate the countless and growing issues of Griffonia. Instead of just using his research to heal the weak and broken, Leopold could use it to protect them from becoming as such by creating a force of griffons that through the usage of magical technology were pushed beyond the limits of their flesh. After all, considering the most prosperous and stable realm in the world - Equestria, survived through the efforts of the great few, would Griffonia not benefit from such heroes, if manufactored?\n\nHowever to most, even the most wicked of Gamia, this sounded like insanity and worst of heresies, and thus Leopold was forced to flee beyond where the rapidly shrinking power of Griffon Empire could hunt him down. In his exile he would be approached by Ambrosius, who surprisingly applauded such an idea and more importantly, the potential of the mastermind behind it, inviting him to come to a domain where such ideas could be entertained.\n\nMany years have passed since then, and now Leopold is something far beyond the wide eyed genius idealist. While initially reluctant to apply the usual Barrad methodology, the seemingly endless brutality of Griffonian collapse, has convinced the Griffon that the sacrifices are worth the potential result. Furthermore, now Leopold doesn’t limit himself to the idea of creating modified heroes, rather he thinks that Griffonia needs it’s own “alicorns”, demigods who could rule and protect the populace, and believes that through magical and technological modifications, he could become this saviour."
bar_pen_viira_info_text:0 "When we are little, most of us are told that we are special, unique, nothing like the other inhabitants of this world. In many cases this belief is shattered as we grow up and learn the world is just that much more larger and we are nothing special in the grand scheme of things. For very specific cases however, it’s different. One of these special cases is Viira the Seer.\n\nViira was born as a deer with substantial magical powers, quite the rarity for the species who rarely possessed active magical abilities. Thus since her youth she was spoiled and treated like an offspring of the highest of lords, despite her somewhat unremarkable bloodline, all while taught the mysteries of the strange magic of the deer. She excelled at the art due to certain quirks, such as her extreme hyperfocus and single-minded concentration on certain topics, learning and mastering the few controlled magical abilities deer could have at an extremely young age. This was her greatest triumph yet, but which wouldn’t really last as Viira would soon discover that many species were far more powerful than the deer, in both their countries and their magical abilities.\n\nThis was a shattering revelation to the young doe, who thought herself on top of the world. But it also gave her inspiration, after all if other creatures could use their magic to dominate the physical world to such an effect, why not deer? The issue must have been that no seer has thought or attempted of reaching such heights, or of course was too weak or lazy to try achieving something. She wasn’t like that. And of course this would also mean that there was no future for Viira in her home, thus she left to wander the world, searching for any magical secrets which could lead to a deer becoming as powerful as the magic users of other races.\n\nViira would become somewhat of an oddity in many places, a single doe wandering the land in pristine exotic clothes which most don’t recognize, to the frustration of the seer, usually carrying around several tomes for recording any new information. Her priorities and acting towards others would also be surprising to onlookers, as she would choose to speak with a simple peasant rather than the lord or flip from polite to furious all based on what sort of knowledge about magic the creature in question would posses. An exception to this pattern would be countries openly dominated by magicians, as these were the only places where Viira would show respect and even admiration, and try mingling with the elite in an attempt to learn how such paradises were created and governed. It would be during one of such meetings, that Viira would meet Ambrosius and hear about his proposal. She of course accepted, after all, who could refuse?\n\nNow Viira spends her time as one of the more distant members of the Barrad pentarchy, studying magical arts within her quarters, trying to achieve the ability of dominating the material world through her magic so that one day she could bring this knowledge and the enlightened ideal of rule of the magical to the rest of deerkind."
