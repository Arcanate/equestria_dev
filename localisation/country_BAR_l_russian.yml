barrad_silver_star.1.d:0 "Наш Магистрат Сильвер Стар известен своей властной над ним паранойей. Однако, похоже что всё хуже чем ожидалось, ибо он не может успокоиться даже во сне.\n\nМаг выбежал из своей комнаты в безумии, крича так громко как он мог о ужасах которые он видел. Когда слуги смогли прижать его, Магистрат продолжил бредить о побеге от ужасающих монстров которые хотят разорвать его в клочья. Затем он сказал об видениях его союзников которые доставали клинки и резали его множество раз, выкидывая его высушенную оболочку где-то в лесу\n\nСлуги пытались его успокоить, но всё бесполезно. Сильвер Стар поднялся и стал обходить коридоры, приказав усилить охрану у его спальни и слугам быть настороже каких-либо убийц. Затем он закрылся в своей спальне и стал похаживать вокруг да около, рассуждая о предателях и шпионах."

BAR_silver_hides_in_the_corner:0 "Поиски Сильвер Стара"
BAR_silver_hides_in_the_corner_desc:0 "Все приготовления перед охотой прошли гладко, и все были готовы - все, кроме Сильвер Стара. Мага-параноика нигде не видать - Граф быстро выпустил Асинти и Леопольда чтобы найти Сильвера и закончить его игру в прятки."
BAR_viira_focus_on_important_things:0 "Дело Величайшей Важности..."
BAR_viira_focus_on_important_things_desc:0 "Её Магистрат Виира известна за её упрямость и самолюбие, однако, она также амбициозна и одержима. Если убедить её выйти из башни и забыть об её эго, Пентархия будет намного веселее!"
BAR_put_an_effort:0 "...Подумав Ещё Раз"
BAR_put_an_effort_desc:0 "После бесчисленных провальных попыток вытащить олениху из башни, Виира своими действиями сказала что ей нечего делать снаружи. В последней попытке Амброзий предложил информацию о культах взамен на выход из башни. После неловкого молчания Виира вышла и сказала: "Теперь я заинтересована"."
BAR_produce_guns:0 "Производство Оружия"
BAR_produce_guns_desc:0 "Его Магистрат Леопольд очень сдержан, часто просиживает дни в своей башне, вдали от внешнего мира. Однако, как грифон из Герцланда он имеет хорошие знания об современном вооружении. Он послал предложение Графу сделать кучу пушек. Граф принял запрос в нетрезвом состоянии и одобрил его даже не читая что там."
BAR_produce_magical_guns:0 "Эксперимент С Кристаллами"
BAR_produce_magical_guns_desc:0 "Годами Леопольд пытался закончить свой проект, "кристальную винтовку", ружьё способное стрелять от магии вместо пороха. К сожалению ему никогда не удавалось довести идею до идеала - до настоящего времени. Недавно леопольд показал Графу своё изобретение, жестоко уничтожив его передний дворик вспышкой магического света."
BAR_produce_more_guns:0 "Будущее Производство Оружия"
BAR_produce_more_guns_desc:0 "Леопольд послал ещё один запрос на оружие. Граф получил его в довольно трезвом состоянии (в этот раз), так что он решил: чтобы не получать личные запросы он приказал построить оружейную у восточной реки. Граф поздравил себя за его гениальную идею, после чего выпил 5 пинт пива."
BAR_gather_peasants:0 "Собрать Крестьян"
BAR_gather_peasants_desc:0 "Лидеры Баррада получили много внимания - к сожалению, негативного. Дюжины приключенцев входят в наши земли чтобы уничтожить печально известную Пентархию. Пришло время расправиться с этими "героями" - мы призовём на службу новобранцев-крестьян из деревней Баррада чтобы побороть иностранцев, даже если нам придёт выгонять их из домов своими силами." 
BAR_borrow_peasants:0 "Одолжить Крестьян"
BAR_borrow_peasants_desc:0 "После набора Баррадских крестьян, Его Магистрат Асинти вежливо попросил одолжить парочку для продвижения его эксперимента. Мы с радостью дадим ему что нужно чтобы иметь более лучшее коллективное понимание о мире в котором мы живём, и больше."
BAR_gather_nobles:0 "Собрать \"Аристократов\""
BAR_gather_nobles_desc:0 "По Барраду разбросаны поместья самых богатых пони - эти "аристократы" почти ежедневно устраивают вечеринки с Графом и занимаются тёмной магией. Они контролируют взносы которые могут быть полезными в решении наших проблем, а так как они ещё и пьяницы то всё должно пройти без трудностей." 
BAR_hunting_party:0 "Команда Охотников"
BAR_hunting_party_desc:0 "Мы вооружили наших охотников и рассказали им наш план, мы провели великий пир чтобы воодушевить наших союзников. Настало время найти всю дичь скрывающуюся в наших лесах.\n\nДа начнётся охота!"

### Chapter 2 ###
BAR_meeting_of_four:0 "Встреча Четырёх"
BAR_meeting_of_four_desc:0 "We have discovered... something. A loosely bound codex containing faded ink and crumbling parchment. Whatever knowledge is contained within will be very old. Now who’s reading it first?"
BAR_viira_adventure:0 "Другой Подход"
BAR_viira_adventure_desc:0 "Although the language is unreadable, it is not unfamiliar either. There are some similarities to the language used by the local cult. Too many to dismiss as a coincidence."
BAR_contact_cultists:0 "Contact Cultists"
BAR_contact_cultists_desc:0 "Viira has managed to successfully track down more members of Barrad's shadowy cult. Now all she needs to do is initiate contact and gain their trust. After that, they will hopefully be willing to shed some light on recent discoveries."
BAR_barrad_machine_concept:0 "Secrets Revealed"
BAR_barrad_machine_concept_desc:0 "Formalities have concluded with Viira persuading the cultists to consider her worthy of hearing their teachings. The time for introductions is over, now is the time for some answers."
BAR_viira_resources:0 "A Gift"
BAR_viira_resources_desc:0 "Viira has made a good impression on the cultists, and several of them were nice enough to provide her with some interesting artifacts in appreciation. Despite their obscurity, these ponies seem to be very well connected."
BAR_barrad_machine_mystery:0 "A Mystery?"
BAR_barrad_machine_mystery_desc:0 "Viira approached the cultists in search of answers, but she leaves with more questions than ever. Their beliefs are very strange; what they claim would explain some parts of Barrad's bizarre nature, but not everything. Something bigger is going on here, and Viira is determined to get to the bottom of it."
BAR_capture_cultists:0 "Capture Cultists"
BAR_capture_cultists_desc:0 "Asinti has no patience for indulging these maniacs. What they know is of no consequence compared to what they are: ideal candidates for a ritual. Luring them to their dooms will be a simple matter."
BAR_grand_sacrifice:0 "Grand Sacrifice"
BAR_grand_sacrifice_desc:0 "Asinti is eager to perform a sacrifice for his divine companion, and all the preparations are complete. Let the blood flow! This offering will gain us much favour, indeed..."
BAR_elisay_valley_factories:0 "Elisay Valley Manufacturies"
BAR_elisay_valley_factories_desc:0 "Elisay Valley's high and resource rich peaks make it less affected by Barrad's infamous weather, and a considerable source of the nation's ore and crystals. Together, these traits make the valley a prime candidate for a new industrial park."
BAR_elisay_valley_terraforming:0 "Терраформириование Долины"
BAR_elisay_valley_terraforming_desc:0 "In the dark ages, our ancestors were limited by the land around them. With projects to clear otherwise unusable terrain being extraordinarily expensive and time consuming. Now, with the power of industry to assist us, we can do in months what may once have taken years to accomplish."
BAR_alchemy_plantations:0 "Алхимические Плантации"
BAR_alchemy_plantations_desc:0 "Agriculture! This is the foundation on which civilization is built. Сильвер Стар knows this and as such has made proposals to create new crops that will be resistant to the extreme of our land, and totally immune to the various strains of blight that plague their less magical brethren."
BAR_sentient_livestock:0 "Разумный Скот"
BAR_sentient_livestock_desc:0 "With the appropriate application of magic it may be possible to instill a greater intelligence into our livestock, permitting them to perform more complex tasks and lessen the burden our peasants carry."
BAR_new_mine:0 "Новая Шахта"
BAR_new_mine_desc:0 "Barrad's land houses a cornucopia of crystals. We must extract as much of them as possible. To do so, we will establish new mines and excavate them by any means necessary. Soon the riches deep within these lands will be ours."
BAR_mining_eq:0 "Шахтёрское Оборудование"
BAR_mining_eq_desc:0 "There exists many fundamental truths in this world. The sky is blue, water is wet, and steel is stronger than stone. We’ll need new equipment to prove that last one."
BAR_leopold_research:0 "Изучение Кристаллов"
BAR_leopold_research_desc:0 "With such an abundance of crystals now at our disposal it would be a shame to have very narrow uses for them. Леопольд has already discovered many practical uses for the magical gems, in his spare time but a dedicated team would undoubtably find even more. The only issue is funding such a team."
BAR_industrial_eq:0 "Промышленное Оборудование"
BAR_industrial_eq_desc:0 "The forge and anvil have served us well for a long, long time but now it’s time to lay them to Отдохнуть. With modern equipment like lathes we will be able to produce far more complex goods of significantly higher quality."
BAR_leopold_res:0 "Скорая Выгода"
BAR_leopold_res_desc:0 "Leopold's efforts are already paying dividends. The output of these new mining and industrial facilities will greatly aid him in his research. Research that will help bring about a new age for all creatures!"
BAR_another_party:0 "Another Party"
BAR_another_party_desc:0 "Things have been unusually quiet around Ambrosius' manor recently. Since it has been a while since the Count's last shindig, it will not be long until he demands another to quell his boredom."
BAR_another_party_stay_longer:0 "Stay..."
BAR_another_party_stay_longer_desc:0 "Enjoying yourself? Wait, don't leave! You don't want to know what happened to the last ones that tried to leave... Come closer, there is something we must discuss... erm, what was your name again?"
BAR_just_a_bit_longer:0 "...a Bit..."
BAR_just_a_bit_longer_desc:0 "Ah yes, of course, I remember now. Have a seat, I insist. Let us indulge in games and drink! All the while, I shall tell you about the wondrous advancements made possible by my magical experiments."
BAR_silver_gets_resources_from_nobles:0 "...Longer"
BAR_silver_gets_resources_from_nobles_desc:0 "Yes, overcoming death itself! Truly extraordinary, is it not? Of course, such a thing would only be possible if you were to help me in acquiring materials for my research..."
BAR_virra_magic_trick:0 "Party Trick"
BAR_virra_magic_trick_desc:0 "Viira knows that the best way to get support from wealthy ponies is by impressing them. A little performance can go a long way, it makes them lower their guard and open their coin purses."
BAR_meeting_of_four_two:0 "Decision to Be Made"
BAR_meeting_of_four_two_desc:0 "Much has happened since the last meeting of the four Pentarchs, and many things have become clear. It is time to meet once again to agree on what next steps to take, and who should take the lead."

BAR_organise_servants:0 "Organise Servants"

BAR_interesting_opportunity_desc:0 "In the past, I once journeyed to the mountains and saw the griffon communities living there. The Count foolishly allowed these griffons to flaunt his authority and contribute nothing to larger society. I will not be making the same mistake."

BAR_viira_manpower01_desc:0 "To the north lie the Riverponies, the greatest threat to my rule. I grow tired of their arrogance. Those cowards are blind to the truth of power, or the price that must be paid to attain it. I will humble them and show them this truth."

BAR_viira_arty:0 "Big Guns"
BAR_viira_arty_desc:0 "Artillery is a vital component of any modern army. These heavy weapons can hurl destruction over long distances, with incredible lethality. My forces must be properly supported by mortars if they are to be effective."

BAR_viira_asymetrical_warfare:0 "Asymmetric warfare"
BAR_viira_asymetrical_warfare_desc:0 "Sometimes, the smartest strategy is not fighting the enemy head-on. By biding my time and only striking when opportunity presents itself, I can exploit the enemy's weaknesses and achieve victory with the greatest possible efficiency."

BAR_cult_peacekeepers:0 "Cult Peacekeepers"
BAR_cult_peacekeepers_desc:0 "Now that the rift within the organisation has been resolved, the cult can be used as a tool to help maintain order in Barrad. After all, it's only fair that they help us after we were kind enough to help them..."
BAR_matter_of_court:0 "Matters of the Court"
BAR_matter_of_court_desc:0 "It seems some are harbouring misapprehensions about their place in Barrad. Just because Ambrosius is away does not mean his will is liable to be undermined by ambitious upstarts. Let there be no ambiguity: the Count's authority is absolute."
BAR_trickery_experience:0 "A Lesson in Trickery"
BAR_trickery_experience_desc:0 "Throughout history, those dwelling in the mountains have proven to be very effective fighters. Especially when it comes to guerilla warfare. Perhaps our griffons could teach us a thing or two about tactics?"

BAR_air_battle_support:0 "Friends in High Places"
BAR_air_battle_support_desc:0 "Support from aircraft has the potential to be the decisive factor in ground battles, and by making effective use of it we can tip the scales in our favour. We must train our pilots to coordinate closely with ground forces in order to provide support and protection."

"Я вам выслал приглашение на великое празднование. Самые достойные существа на наших землях будут на нём присутствовать, и мы вместе увидим невероятные чудеса, не виданные когда-либо ранее!" Лишь эти слова приводили Амброзия в восхищение, отчего он даже подпрыгнул. "Прийди же, наконец, в моё поместье, чтоб мы могли начать праздненства. Твой друг, Граф Амбррозий I." Грифон еле успевал записывать за Амброзием, со всей скорости водя пером по пергаменту. "Ооо, это будет весело. Очень весело!" засмеялся Амброзий.\n\nГрифон дописал и посмотрел на Амброзия. "Кому это сообщение отправить?" сказал грифон, а Граф застыл, не слыша вопрос вообще. "Пентархии?" спросил грифон.\n\n"Пентархии. Пентархия..." Амброзий бросил взгляд в пустоту, и на мгновение задумался. "Ну, нам просто необходима Виира. Её невероятные таланты очень нам помогут." сказал Амброзий и пощупал подбородок. "И Леопольду. Без него наша вечеринка - вообще не вечеринка! Он там обязан быть. Но вот Сильвер Стар, с другой стороны..." Граф скорчил лицо от отвращения. "Очень грубый гость. Мы и без него обойдёмся. И... как звали того старого зебру?"\n\nГрифон снял с шеи флягу с жидкостью и передал Амброзию, который сделал жадный глоток из неё. Граф проморгался, затем осмотрел всё комнату. "Спасибо, Гасеница."

Он с большой радостью рассказал об организованной им крупной охоте. Дворяне были в восторге и стали умолять Графа рассказать что-то ещё. Он сказал им, что в лесах есть много зверей, и что их стаёт лишь больше.\n\nОн затем громко объявил, “Итак, дорогие мои друзья, пора начать на них охоту, великую охоту!”. Потом, он сказал уже чуть мягче, “Но перед тем, как мы начнём охоту, мы сначала должны подготовиться к такому событию. Сегодня вы увидите самую экзотическую пищу и самые вычурные напитки, которые я смог создать. Да начнётся же пир, за наше здоровье и славу!”\n\n“За славу!”, воскликнули дворяне прямо перед тем, как приступить к поглощению пищи, которую им принесли, после чего принялись её запивать неприличным количеством пива и вина.\n\nКак только Граф собирался начать есть, Сильвер Стар нервно попросил отпустить его. Граф нехотя пустил его, после сразу же вернулся к своему блюду и своей кружке."

После того, как за пару часов собрались все члены Пентархии, группа охотников примерно в 100 членов, отправилась из поместья Амброзия. Они начали идти по лесам, убивая одиноких путешественников и небольшие группы на своём пути, время от времени - особо невезучих крестьян. Они так шли часами, убив более дюжины пони и грифонов в лесах, после складывая их тела в телеги, которые Асинти приказал везти. Даже Сильвер Стар, несмотря на свой нервный характер, убил парочку путешественников, за что его похвалили его союзники, в частности сам Амброзий.\n\nГруппа уже начала разворачиваться и идти обратно, как вдруг они услышали какой-то звук вдали. Пентархия и ещё пара дюжин дворян пошли разбираться, что же вызвало этот звук, а другие остались стеречь добычу. Как только экспедиция дошла до источника звука, они встретили довольно крупную группу путешественников, которая собиралась казнить несколько вычурно одетых пони. Экспедиция быстро одолела путешественников и захватила выкраденных пони. Они потом вернулись к основной группе и пошли дальше, обратно в поместье."

Асинти просил дать их ему, на что ему Виира ответила: “Вам всё ещё мало, доктор?” Амброзий заткнул их обоих и рассказал о своём плане:\n\n“Очевидно, что мы мало знаем об этих странных пони. Я жажду узнать больше о них. Я предлагаю их допросить, чтобы узнать кто они, или даже что они есть.”\n\nДругие члены Пентархии согласно кивнули. Пони были быстро допрошены, после того, как им показали место встречи. Пони показали Пентархии пещеру, в которой были разнообразные надписи. Было предположено, что они принадлежат членам какого-то древнего культа. Последнее, что показали культисты - ряд рун, похожих на инструкцию к какому-то устройству. Вид этого устройства был совсем вне понимания членов Пентархии, даже сами культисты мало о нём знали. Получив эти знания, Пентархия разделилась: Сильвер Стар побежал обратно в свою башню, Асинти и Виира вступили в продолжительный спор, Леопольд пытался понять принцип работы устройства, а Амброзий выпил пару пинт эля, и потерял сознание на троне."

Полчаса спустя, их впустили. Они вошли в комнату мага, но его там не нашли. Они недовольно прорычали и уже было собирались уходить. Проходя мимо шкафа, Асинти услышал какой-то шорох.\n\n"Ты слышал, Леопольд? Звук был, наверное, из шкафа. Ну конечно же он не..."\n\n"И куда ещё он мог деться?"\n\n"В ванную, как и любое другое разумное существо."\n\nАсинти резко широко разпахнул дверцы шкафа, и увидел в нём дрожащего от ужаса Сильвер Стара. Сильвер выпал, как бревно, его еле поймал Леопольд. Он осторожно положил единорога на пол, затем подошёл к Асинти.\n\n "Как мы его убедим пойти с нами?"\n\n"Не волнуйся, я всё продумал."\n\n Асинти начал издавать всякие громкие звуки перед Сильвером, и рассказал ему про жестоких казаков в лесу, которые вот-вот собирались пойти на нас в поход, и что Граф хочет, чтобы Сильвер всех повёл в бой. Леопольд, видя растущий страх Сильвера, оттолкнул Асинти и начал успокаивать Сильвера, заверив его, что никаких таких казаков нет, и что Граф лишь хочет с ним повидаться. Сильвер, хоть и очень робко, медленно поднялся и пошёл с ними. Асинти и Леопольд наконец пошли, и грифон принялся громко ругать Асинти за его поведение."

"Так как наш храбрый Граф пока занят, нам необходимо самим это расшифровать." Сказала Виира и положила на стол загадочный кодекс. "Нам нужен план действий," продолжила она, и бросила взгляд на своих сотоварищей. Леопольд не обращал вообще никакого внимания, продолжая изучать переписанные из пещеры надписи. Асинти сидел с закрытыми глазами и уже было опускал голову. Он что, спал? Сильвер Стар нахмурился и ухватился за свой кодекс с магией.\n\n"Я уверен, что в одной из древних книг в моём распоряжении есть что-то, что поможет мне помочь найти информацию об этих рунах," сказал Сильвер Стар, прищурив глаза. "Вот только я никогда не позволю кому-либо из ВАС туда глянуть." Сказал он и подозрительно осмотрел всех в комнате. "Это глупо. Очень глупо," сказал он себе.\n\nЛеопольд пренебрежительно махнул когтями. "Если мы будем думать вместе, мы и сами поймём. Не нужны нам твои непонятные запыленные текста," сказал он сухо. Сильвер Стар облизнул свои губы и оттолкнул кодекс обратно к середине стола.\n\n"Леопольд, это будет слишком долго. Мы должны сразу исследовать первоисточник." Виира похлопала по кодексу. "Нам нужно связаться с культом, чтобы расспросить их и узнать побольше," сказала она. Она сказала это таким тоном, что спорить никому не вздумалось; это, очевидно, был приказ, а не предложение.\n\n"Нет." Разнёсся хриплый голос. "Я слышу их шёпот." Асинти посмотрел на Вииру с широко раскрытыми глазами. "Да, нам нужно найти культ. Но не для вежливого разговора, мы должны их выкрасть! Их жертва удовлетворит тех, кто извне." сказал он и очень широко улыбнулся. Остальные трое присутствующих молча на него посмотрели."

"Но вечеринка всё оживила. Охота! Убийства! Мистика! Так захватывающе..." сказал Амброзий и задумчиво почесал бороду. "Я знаю, что нужно сделать: устроить ещё одну вечеринку, побольше, покрупнее." Граф Амброзий на радостях зашёл в тронный зал.\n\n"Больше пьянства, больше пиршеств, больше веселья!" Амброзий, лишь думая о праздненствах, радостно улыбался. "Начать подготовку прямо сейчас! Выслать приглашения Пентархии и всем дворянам." Он медленно повернулся к Гасенице, с такой же, как и ранее улыбкой, но с мрачным взглядом.

Они вдвоём выглянули с балкона поместья на ближайшую деревню, на девственные леса и горы вдали. Амброзий указал на наблюдательную вышку в селе. "Вот, туда будет нормально."\n\nВиира сначала сконцентрировала своё внимание, затем закрыла глаза. Вокруг неё в воздухе витала какая-то странная энергия, её провидческая роба стала колыхаться от магической силы. Как вдруг, крупная часть деревни вокруг башни покрылась тёмным туманом. Когда туман развеялся, всё, что в нём было, исчезло. "Невероятно!" выкрикнул один из гостей, пока остальные перешёптывались.

"Вы создали эти чертежи?" спросила Виира, показав инструкции к использованию того странного устройства.\n\n"Нет, они от владыки," ответила послушница.\n\n"Владыки?"\n\n"Вы считали, что Баррадом правит Амброзий? Нет, истинный правитель скрыт от недостойных и слабых. Наша цель - служить Ему, продолжать служить уже на протяжении многих веков.", - сказала послушница и опустила капюшон. "Но мы провалились.

Послушница в капюшоне глянула вверх и подняла копыта, чем призвала остальных сделать также.\n\n"Что же хочет эта машина?" У Вииры было полно вопросов. "Могу я с ней повидаться?"\n\n"Лишь немногие привилегированные достойны следовать Его воле, и ещё меньше - ощущать Его присутствие. Мы лишь Внешний Круг, я уже рассказала всё, что смогла. Если желаешь узнать больше, то тее нужно связаться с Внутренним Кругом."\n\n"Понимаю.", - скромно сказала Виира и поклонилась.\n\n"Когда будете готовы, ищите их." Послушница подняла копыто.

У входа она увидела какого-то пони, который из неё выходил. "Что ты тут делаешь?" спросила его Виира.\n\nПони остановился и ответил: "Да так, просто путешествую.". Виира внимательно его осмотрела, что-то в нём было странное. Он был одет в весьма богатые одежды, и ему, видимо, было не сильно удобно в такой природной среде.\n\n"Что-то нашёл внутри?" спросила Виира. Пони взволнованно покачал головой. "Уверен? Потому что я думаю, что видела пару твоих друзей, которые не разделяют." Виира достала кодекс и показала его этому пони, который осознал происходящее и раскрыл глаза. Он напрягся и стал молча глазеть на Вииру. "Прошу, я не хочу тебе навредить. Я просто хочу понять," стала она умолять.\n\nПони некоторое время тщательно её пообсматривал, затем вздохнул. "Я буду на связи. Если ты покажешь истинность своих намерений, то ты найдёшь ответы." сказал он, и убежал в лес, ничего больше не сказав."

В конце концов, он достал оттуда фотографию и показал её Гасенице.\n\n"Это - автомобиль. Средство передвижения, но зачастую для багачей и прочих влиятельных индивидов - роскошь," разъяснил ему Амброзий. "Мне нужна одна такая. Свяжись с её производителем и убеди их прибыть в Баррад. Я возьму одну из их машин, приукрашу, и сделаю что-то своё." Он резко сложил вместе копыта и сказал: "Ооо, я её уже представляю прямо перед собой!"\n\n"Уже лечу, сэр." кивнул Гасеница, и взлетел. Граф на него и не обратил внимания, зато продолжал разглядывать фотографию, и что-то бормотал про тюнинг, который он задумал."

"Сэр, до меня дошли слухи, что ужасная угроза громит деревни в горах!" выговорил он перед тем, как восстановить дыхание.\n\n"А, да, те доклады о растениях-мутантах у югозападных границ. Воистину нестандартная ситуация." Амброзий взял из его когтей документы и лениво их попросматривал. "Там внизу много грифонов... ты же примерно в той местности вырос, да?"\n\n"Да," сказал Гасеница. "Мы им как-то поможем?" сказал он, с заметной взволнованностью в голосе.\n\n"Не стоит беспокоится, я уже отправил письмо Пентархии." сказал Амброзий и безразлично отмахнул копытом. "Они с этим справятся. Наверное. Ты знаешь, как у них сейчас обстановка? Они все всё ещё живы?" Граф моргнул пару раз и начал резво трясти головой. "В любом случае, Я попросил их изучить вопрос и решить его. Они приступят, когда смогут, и тогда мы сотрём эту угрозу с нашей земли!"\n\nВ ответ, Гасеница нахмурился."

barrad_third.3.d:0 "Deep in the hostile forests of Barrad, Viira entered the ancient halls of an unmarked compound. The air was damp and heavy as her guides — a pair of robed ponies — led her into a dark room deep in the bowels of the compound. She found herself surrounded by shadowed figures standing on a circular raised platform, observing her.\n\n"Wise ones, it is an honour to stand before you." Viira bowed. "I humbly ask for your aid in my research, for I have no doubt that you all are the key to securing our future." The cultists listened silently, before conferring among themselves.\n\n"You wish to know the secrets of the Inner Circle," one of the figures said. Viira couldn’t tell which one. "Your reputation precedes you. But to know the nature of the gifts we protect, you first must prove your worth to us by completing the Trial.""

barrad_third.4.t:0 "Rites of Passage"
barrad_third.4.d:0 ""Outsider, to prove yourself you must first complete the Trial of the Machine." A hooded acolyte presented a burning candle to Viira. "Take this. Travel through the caves, find the sacred lantern, and then return here. If the candle goes out, you fail the Trail, and then you will be lost."\n\nViira nodded, descending down the dark cave path to begin the Trial. She navigated the treacherous path for close to an hour with only the light of the candle to guide her, before at last coming upon a conspicuous alcove containing an ornate lantern. She took the lantern, placing the candle inside it, before making the long trek back to where she had started.\n\nUpon returning, the acolyte rejoiced at the sight of her. "It is complete!" He took the lantern with great reverence. "You walked the path of ignorance, guided by the light of knowledge, and with the protection of the Great Machine, returned to us so that you may pass this knowledge on to the next generation.""

barrad_third.5.d:0 ""May I enter?" Viira stood before an enormous door leading below the cult's compound, protected by several guards.\n\n"No," One of the guards—a grifon—stated flatly. "Only the most senior among us are permitted to enter the abyssal chamber." The words contained hints of an Aquileian accent.\n\n"I see." Viira studied the griffon closely. She seemed to be in charge of all the other guards. "You're not from around here, are you?"\n\n"That is true. I was... compelled to come here and abandon my natural history studies in Aquileia." The griffon's eyes looked past Viira for a moment. "But it is here that I found my purpose, in the service of the Great Machine."\n\n"I have come a long way from my home, as well." Viira brought a hoof to her chest. "I hope that I may also find my purpose here."\n\n"That's all well and good, but you're still not getting in." said the griffon, unimpressed. Viira nodded and walked away.\n\n"
barrad_third.5.a:0 "Fair enough."
barrad_third.6.t:0 "Splinters"
barrad_third.6.d:0 "The air was thick and heavy as Viira wandered through a cavern deep beneath the lair of the Inner Circle. Hidden behind layers of oppressive darkness, she could just barely make out a series of bizarre silhouettes filling the cavern: the Old Machines. According to the cultists, they were gifts from the Great Machine to be worshiped and cared for, although when she pressed them they confessed not to know the original purpose of these strange creations.\n\nViira got close to one and examined it using the light of her torch. The "machine" was tall and intimidating, but also unlike anything she had ever seen before. Its lines and curves were aesthetically pleasing, seeming more the work of a sculptor than a mechanist. The texture was nothing like the machines of Leopold, it did not look metallic at all. Viira reached out a hoof to feel its surface and found it not as cold as she expected. It felt rubbery, so she pushed to test its firmness. And it groaned.\n\nThis thing was... alive? The surface shifted all on its own. Viira's blood went cold. There was no doubt. These machines had been grown, not built. Now aware that she was surrounded by organic beings, Viira was overcome by a feeling of unease. She felt like she was being watched, watched by something larger and more alien than anything she had previously imagined. Most of all, she felt afraid. Viira steeled herself. Now was not the time to turn back, not when confronted by such an opportunity for discovery. She needed to push forward."

barrad_third.61.d:0 "After a brief period of trial and error, Viira was able to successfully awaken the Old Machines using magical stimulus. The cultists were amazed and grateful to finally see the full potential of their mysterious gifts realised. Unfortunately, the machines proved too dangerous to study in much detail after being turned on. Regardless, the computational abilities of the strange constructs are now being put to use for the advancement of Barrad."

barrad_third.62.t:0 "Observation"
barrad_third.62.d:0 "After a brief period of deliberation, Viira decided to study the Old Machines closely while refraining from stimulating them any further. By making use of specialised equipment she was able to glance inside the strange constructs without harming them. In the end, she determined that the organic computers could not have been a natural occurrence, and must have been built by something. Additionally, the information she uncovered about their structure will be sure to advance our understanding of computing."

barrad_third.8.d:0 "As he made the long and arduous trek over treacherous mountain paths, Gąsienica's mind was consumed by thoughts of his home. Distant memories from when he had lived there; memories of joy, innocence, and then the most intense fear. Back before he had been saved by Ambrosius... but now was not the time to dwell on that. Much more pressing was confronting the novel menace that threatened to destroy his kin.\n\nAfter emerging from a narrow pass, he at last laid eyes on his home village, only to see it besieged by an army of shambling trees. The villagers were mounting a stiff resistance, but clearly wouldn't be able to hold out for much longer. Gąsienica let loose a shout and charged towards the trees at full speed, slamming into them with all his weight and ferocity. Fighting using only his bare claws, he split trunks and ripped off branches with his incredible strength. The villagers were inspired by the show of bravery and pushed forward, cutting down the trees with their swords and axes.\n\nOne of the fighters chucked an improvised incendiary bomb into the cluster of trees, which exploded setting many ablaze. Frightened, the remaining trees ceased their attack and began to slowly retreat. "I said no fire!" a voice shouted. "Maniacs! Are you trying to burn the whole village down?" Griffons rushed to keep the flames under control, but the voice brought back memories for Gąsienica. It was a voice he had not heard in a lifetime."
barrad_third.8.a:0 "Could it really be, after all these years?"
barrad_third.81.t:0 "Find Your Way"
barrad_third.81.d:0 "Gąsienica waded through the victorious militia to find an old friend from his childhood leading them. "Jánošík!" he shouted, raising his claws high. "I hope you've been staying out of trouble!" Jánošík laughed and pulled Gąsienica in for an embrace.\n\n"I try my best," Jánošík said with a grin, drawing a sceptical look from Gąsienica. "Sure, occasionally I liberate a noble passerby from their wealth, but I never keep it for myself. It all goes to the people who need it most." Jánošík had to tilt his head up to engage in the conversation, such was the degree to which Gąsienica towered over him. "Say, I remember you being big, but now you're built like a tank! What's your secret?" Gąsienica frowned, remembering the many experiments Ambrosius had performed on him to enhance his physical performance. In the awkward silence that followed, Jánošík nervously tugged at the ornate amulet around his neck.\n\n"What's that?" asked Gąsienica, noticing it for the first time. "I never pictured you being very fond of jewelry."\n\n"This? Erm... it's just a trinket. Sort of a good luck charm." Jánošík gave a sheepish smile. "Silly, I know."\n\nA sharp gust of wind blew a branch from one of the slain plants onto the ground between them. Gąsienica picked it up to give it a closer look. "That's strange. These leaves look like the kind I use to make the Count's medicine." He took one in his claw to feel its texture.\n\n"We'll have more time for botany later, but right now I think we just made them angry." Jánošík looked towards the horizon. "There will be more of those things coming soon, and we need to prepare.""

barrad_third.82.t:0 "A Time for Heroes"
barrad_third.82.d:0 ""Gather 'round, everyone!" Gąsienica shouted as he stood next to a pile of nondescript crates. "We're going to need all the firepower we can muster to beat back these monsters. Fortunately, I came prepared." He kicked open one of the crates to reveal its contents: dozens of shiny new magical rifles. "Grab one, and take up a defensive position around the village!" The townsfolk did as they were told, and soon formed a makeshift skirmish line facing the approaching enemy. The shambling trees were slow to advance, but were coming closer and closer by the minute.\n\nWhen they came within range, the villagers began firing, their magical projectiles proving highly effective against the plant monsters. At the same time, Gąsienica charged out ahead, using his claws to rip the trees apart with reckless abandon. Jánošík was right by his side, felling many trees with his axe.\n\nDuring the fierce fighting, Jánošík tripped and became tangled in the roots of the slain plants, and the trees around him converged to finish him off. In desperation, he ripped the amulet off his neck and held it out towards the encroaching monsters, closing his eyes in anticipation of the killing blow...\n\nBut the blow never came. Sensing the magic of the amulet, they dared not come any closer to it. As the plants remained still, shots from the villagers and Gąsienica's devastating strikes shredded them. It did not take much longer for the remaining trees to be broken. Gąsienica, Jánošík, and the entire village stood victorious."
barrad_third.82.a:0 "Now that's what I call landscaping!"
barrad_third.83.t:0 "Journey's End"
barrad_third.83.d:0 "After fighting off all the attacking trees, Gąsienica sat recovering with Jánošík in his home. "I think it's time you explained what's really going on with that amulet," said Gąsienica. Jánošík nodded.\n\n"In the past, you may have seen a group of robed idiots scurrying around Barrad, raving about their god, who lives somewhere underground," began Jánošík. "A merchant I know works with them, gathering magical artifacts and the like. It's all supposed to go to the cult, but sometimes they offer some of it up for sale, and this particular item caught my eye. It's said to be imbued with magic that can scare away anything born from the cult's god." He held up the amulet. "Anything that could scare a god sounded pretty interesting to me. Of course at the time I thought that was all nonsense... but maybe those cultists were on to something after all?"\n\n"You know, I've learned a bit of magic in my time around the Pentarchy." Gąsienica examined the amulet closely. "I believe we can use this artifact to cast a warding spell that will make sure those things don't come back." Jánošík was intrigued, and watched as Gąsienica channeled the item's power into a spell. He could feel the magical energy in the air, and from Gąsienica's smile he knew the spell had been a success.\n\nAfterwards, the two went off to save the other mountain villages that were threatened, defeating any plants attacking them and casting the warding spell. After all the other villages were protected, they parted ways, and Gąsienica began his long trek back to Count Ambrosius."

The ground was littered with twisted trunks and branches scarred by deep cuts and magical blasts, the bodies of trees which had only recently threatened to wipe the mountain villages off the map. Viira took a sample from one of the plants, tucking it away inside her bag, before heading towards the nearby village. As she approached the town she could sense a strange magic in the air. She questioned the villagers about the spell, and they pointed her towards the griffon who had cast it.\n\nViira tracked down the griffon, who was named Jánošík, and eagerly shook his claw. "Greetings, I am Viira." She smiled. "And I must say, superb work dealing with those nasty plants! May I ask you a few questions about how you managed it?" Jánošík clearly recognised her and scowled, remaining silent. "Now I know you may not be fond of the Pentarchy, but any information you can provide will help me get to the bottom of this matter, and ensure such a tragedy never occurs again," pled Viira.\n\nJánošík sighed, moved by her sincerity. "All right," he said, leading Viira to the location where he kept an ornate amulet. "This is it." Jánošík offered the amulet for inspection. Viira held it up and flipped through her codex, comparing the symbols inside to those adorning the artifact.\n\n"Interesting..." she marveled."

He was engrossed as the flames consumed the paper, watching it with fascination. Gąsienica was mostly nonplussed.\n\n"But not this little flame, no. Something bigger. Much bigger." Ambrosius smiled contemplating the spectacle. "An inferno that sweeps through all the land, and lights up the sky!" He jumped up from his desk. "Let's go out and set the kindling.

"It took a bit of investigating, but eventually the pieces all fell into place and the truth became obvious. You are no god. You are a made thing, crafted by mortals and then forgotten," her words dripped with contempt. "Consumed by hunger when denied the energy you crave. Crying out in desperation for so many years until I came along. Pathetic." she sneered.\n\n"I can provide you with what you desire, but it will come at a price." Viira brought up a hoof for emphasis. "The price for my satiating your hunger is this: YOU will serve ME, always." An unnatural silence and stillness filled the room, which Viira knew could only mean the acquiescence of the desperate being. Concentrating intensely, she magically drained the reactor of all its incredible energy, empowering the entity while at the same time enslaving it.\n\n"Excellent," she chuckled. There were still things to take care of. That insane Count, for one. Viira grinned. She had something special in mind for him..."

barrad_viira.13.d:0 "As Viira contemplated the fate of the griffon villages near the southwestern border, an idea came into her head. Her perspective had changed greatly since the last time she had been to the mountains. Whereas before she had found such communities quaint and charming, she now saw how primitive and underdeveloped the mountain griffons truly were. They were isolated, crying out for a better way! They needed to be put to work and given more fulfilling lives. But put to work doing what?"
barrad_viira.13.a:0 "Carrying out construction projects."

barrad_viira.997.t:0 "Overcharged"
barrad_viira.997.d:0 ""Yes!" Viira laughed as she made use of her newfound powers. She had always boasted powerful magic, but her current abilities were far beyond those ever wielded by any mortal before. She was the master of fire, earth, water, air, and more! The possibilities were limitless!\n\nSuddenly, Viira felt a pain in her stomach. "Erm." she grimaced. Discomfort was spreading rapidly through her body. "Think I need to lie down..." There she stood one moment, and the next she was gone. A violent explosion consumed her, leaving only a puff of smoke in the shape of her body which slowly dissipated. All that remained of Viira were a series of scorch marks on the ground."

barrad_firanka.1.d:0 "In the library of Silver Star's tower, Viira sat flipping through book after book, searching for an answer. Somewhere within the most complete collection of magical knowledge on Griffonia, there had to be one. She searched and searched until at last she found it: the final piece of the puzzle. Viira smiled. "Now all I have to do is-"\n\n"WHAT are you DOING in here?" Silver Star exploded, standing at the library entrance.\n\n"Silver Star, thank goodness I found you!" Viira ran frantically over to him. "They've come back for you, they want to kill you!" She grabbed his shoulders and shook vigourously.\n\n"Oh no." Silver Star's eyes went impossibly wide. "No, no, no," he repeated, shaking on his own now.\n\n"Don't worry. You find someplace to hide, and I'll take care of them!" Viira packed up her things, including the tome containing the missing piece.\n\n"Hide, yes. Good idea!" Silver Star rushed to open a secret alcove behind one of the bookcases. "And Viira... thank you.""

barrad_ahist.1.d:0 "Dead. They were all dead.\n\nIt was a difficult thing for Count Ambrosius to come to terms with, that the four he had trusted and encouraged for so long had each come to such a miserable end. Ambrosius had always heard  voices. He wanted to understand what they were, why they spoke to him. The Pentarchs were the ones who could answer the questions, unravel the mystery... But now they were gone. The whispers in his head grew louder. Now there was no escape. No reprieve.\n\nTheir will could no longer be denied."
barrad_ahist.1.a:0 "What is thy bidding?"
barrad_ahist.11.t:0 "True Madness"
barrad_ahist.11.d:0 "The whispers had become screams. Unrelenting inside the mind of Ambrosius, they forced him to epiphany. He knew what he had to do. Abandon understanding. Abandon hubris. Surrender his will...\n\nThat was the answer, yes! Then the voices that guided him would solve everything. He just had to listen. They called to him, demanding that he become their herald and reveal to his subjects what had been revealed to him. Ambroius agreed without hesitation; this was his new purpose, one he had tried to avoid for far too long, but no longer. At last, he had found his destiny."
barrad_ahist.11.a:0 "I will make them all see the truth!"
barrad_ccamb.1.t:0 "First Contact"
barrad_ccamb.1.d:0 "Deep beneath the surface of Barrad, Count Ambrosius stood before the reactor with Gąsienica at his side. Ambrosius was in awe of the majestic device, and ephemeral voices beckoned him to approach it, come closer... He did, shambling towards it until suddenly the voices stopped and the pain started.\n\nIt was as if an entire universe was trying to make its home inside his skull! Unable to withstand it, he keeled over, screaming in pain. He brought his hooves to his head in an attempt to keep it from bursting from all he felt inside it. Upon seeing Ambrosius' state, Gąsienica was frantic, and poured many doses of the Count's medicine into his open mouth. Was this much of the drug unsafe? Gąsienica didn't know, but he had to do something.\n\nWithin the mind of Ambrosius, he fought against the invading presence with all his will. His thoughts were chaotic and it was impossible to centre himself. All seemed to be a whirlwind of hatred and hostility, until he noticed a voice inside the cacophony that was different from the rest. He sensed this part of the presence did not wish him harm, and so he focused on it. It told him what the presence truly was, that it was the product of seven ancient unicorns who had merged together into one consciousness, but now was totally dependent on magic in order to survive. It told him that they did not want to cause all this, but that Ambrosius had unleashed a power that had corrupted them. Finally, it told him that it would use the last of its uncorrupted will to free him from his madness.\n\nAmbrosius awoke to find Gąsienica beside him, grateful to see him alive. For the first time in an eternity, the fog was gone. His thoughts were finally clear. He felt like vomiting, but there wasn't time. He was responsible for an immense mistake, and there was no time to waste in putting things right. "Return to the surface, Gąsienica," said Ambrosius. "I must stay here and work on a way to fix what I have broken. Make sure things don't fall apart out there in the meantime.""

barrad_ccamb.2.d:0 "Gąsienica once again trekked through the mountain paths of Barrad, much less urgently than the last time he made the journey. After emerging from a narrow pass, he smiled as he laid eyes on his home village at peace. The aftermath of their battle with the plants was still visible, but now the mangled monstrosities were overgrown by vegetation of a more mundane variety.\n\nAs soon as he entered the town Jánošík came out to greet him, laughing heartily. "Good to see you, friend! Come to drag us out of the fire again?" He gave Gąsienica a playful punch which had absolutely no effect.\n\n"Not this time, fortunately," said Gąsienica. "In fact, I have come to ask you for assistance. The Count is... away dealing with a matter of some importance. As you are a more respected figure than I among the mountain villages, your support would be appreciated at this time." Jánošík wore a mask of inscrutable contemplation. "Since he protected you in your time of need, it's only fair that you help him in return."\n\n"No, no." Jánošík wagged a finger. "It wasn't him that saved us, it was you. And so I will do this for you." His voice shifted to become deadly serious. "Under one condition - if we are to respect your rule, you should respect ours. Promise that our villages will retain their autonomy, and I will help." Gąsienica nodded, and the two shook claws."
barrad_ccamb.2.a:0 "You've got yourself a deal."
barrad_ccamb.3.t:0 "Acquisition"
barrad_ccamb.3.d:0 "Gąsienica walked cautiously down dark forest paths in search of the mysterious merchant Jánošík had dealt with in the past. It was this dealer that had provided them the artifact to ward off the corrupted plants when no other means proved effective, and any creature trading in such powerful magic was worth seeking out. Gąsienica had gone to the last place Jánošík said he met with the merchant, but saw only abandoned buildings with no civilisation in sight.\n\nHe was on the verge of giving up hope when a raspy voice slithered out from the darkness. "A visitor?" Gąsienica turned around and was surprised to find a stallion dressed in discoloured rags beckoning to him. As Gąsienica approached, the stallion gave a wide smile, revealing a glimmering gold tooth. "Come in!" He disappeared into a decrepit shack with Gąsienica following behind.\n\n"You have come a long way looking for something, haven't you?" The stallion looked over the strange items that covered the walls before rummaging through one of the many containers laying haphazardly around the shack. "How about this?" He asked, pulling out an item and tossing it to Gąsienica. "This artifact will ensure you gain the favour of the people," he explained. Gąsienica ran his claws over the teardrop shaped object and could feel the magical power within. "Use it during the wet season to increase crop yields by an enormous amount."\n\nGąsienica had found his merchant, but this was quite unexpected. "You're just... giving it to me?" he asked.\n\n"You have earned it." The merchant raised his hooves high in praise. "You have done more good for this land than you know, my griffon friend!""
barrad_ccamb.3.a:0 "That should come in handy."
barrad_ccamb.4.t:0 "Ambitions"
barrad_ccamb.4.d:0 "Gąsienica met with members of the lesser nobility to assess their loyalty during the Count's absence, and was disturbed by the results. Although they all paid lip service and reaffirmed their fealty to Ambrosius, Gąsienica could see the plotting and scheming behind their flattery. They sensed an opportunity, and were simply waiting for the right time to make their move. It was clear that they were far from convinced, words alone would not be enough."
barrad_ccamb.4.a:0 "Time for some more drastic measures..."
barrad_ccamb.5.t:0 "Divine Disfavour"
barrad_ccamb.5.d:0 "Gąsienica traveled to contact a shadowy cult that operated at the fringes of Barradian society. Although a bit obscure, they had several wealthy patrons and wielded a lot of influence, so gaining their support could prove very useful. When he reached their secluded compound, he found a scene of chaos and heated arguments. No two cultists had kind things to say to one another, and the volatile atmosphere felt like it could combust into violence at any moment.\n\nIt seemed that the Pentarchy's actions had ultimately created a schism within the cult. None of the members had heard from their god in some time, and they felt the deity's influence was growing weaker by the day. Those in the cult's Inner Circle accused the Outer Circle of being faithless, while those in the Outer Circle accused the Inner Circle of becoming corrupt and rotten, prompting their god to abandon them.\n\nGąsienica sighed. He didn't have time for this."
barrad_ccamb.5.a:0 "This must not be allowed to fester!"
barrad_ccamb.6.t:0 "Universal Truth"
barrad_ccamb.6.d:0 "Gąsienica descended back underground to rejoin the Count, now that he was at last ready to exorcise Barrad's ancient curse. When Gąsienica reached him, Ambrosius looked tired, having studied magical texts nearly nonstop preparing the ritual to heal the being that had driven him to madness and back. Gąsienica held his breath as Ambrosius approached the reactor to perform the ritual. When he began the ritual in earnest, power started swirling all around them until suddenly, everything stopped, and the world became still.\n\nA voice spoke to both of them, but it was not the elusive, shifting voice Ambrosius was used to hearing. It was a calm voice, low and quiet but at the same time not difficult to hear. "I am awake." The presence in the air washed over them like an ocean current. "My actions have wrought so much pain, so much destruction. For that, I can not express the magnitude of my sorrow." The room seemed to somehow fill with sadness. "But now I am freed from hunger and chaos, and I wish to do now what I have been unable to do for far too long. Let us make this world a better place."\n\nGąsienica was in shock from what he was witnessing and was completely unsure how to react. Ambrosius, however, smiled. "Yes, let's.""

Singular unsettling tales suggested the mansion itself was a gateway to some fabulous and unnameable power. With relic and ritual, I bent every effort towards the excavation and recovery of those long buried secrets, exhausting what remained of our family fortune on... swarthy workponies and... sturdy shovels. At last, in the salt soaked crags beneath the lowest foundations, we unearthed that damnable portal of antediluvian evil. Our every step unsettled the ancient earth, but we were in a realm of death and madness. In the end, I alone fled, laughing and wailing through those blackened arcades of antiquity. Until consciousness failed me.\n\nYou remember our venerable house, opulent and imperial."

bar_pen_screen_silver_info_text:0 "Fear and desire. These emotions have come to define the life of the unicorn known as Silver Star. Originally he was nothing more than another arrogant scion of the Wittenland noble class. Scheming, somewhat paranoid, and jealous of those in a better position. In this case, it was jealousy directed at a sibling - Queen Whitestar of Wittenland, who managed, much to the dismay of Silver Star, to become the monarch of the realm purely through her magical talent.\n\nUsually, such nobles would remain in the background of important matters of the world, lacking in ability to fulfill their ambition. However, fate had other plans for Silver Star, for he would for one reason or other travel to the very borders of the Wittenland. Here Silver Star would learn why the griffons were such a threat to the creatures of the Riverlands. He would experience several raids by the griffon cossacks and would nearly perish during them.\n\nThe raid affected him greatly, and the culmination of these experiences were recurring nightmares of his untimely death. This pushed Silver Star into studying powerful magic, as one theme was present in all of these dreams no matter who slew him - a lack of power and inability to persist beyond the weakness of his flesh. He would become obsessed with his own mortality, and this led the unicorn down a very dark path, as no matter how much power and knowledge he acquired, the enemies in his nightmares persisted; unbeatable and impossible to endure as ever. And after reaching ones potential in raw magical prowess, there remains only one way to become stronger – by breaking the greatest of taboos in most magical societies. Thus, in an attempt triumph over all his perceived enemies, which Silver Star believed were circling him like vultures, the unicorn turned to dark magic.\n\nHowever, despite his ever increasing power, the safety that Silver Star desired seemed to be fleeting. His paranoia only worsened, as usage of the dark arts transformed his body and mind, forcing him into hiding as it became obvious to any magical creature that the unicorn was being corrupted by the darkness. And yet, for all this power, it was not enough. To Silver Star, his enemies were everywhere, simply waiting for a perfect moment to slay him. And for all this power, he was still unable to master death itself.\n\nWith these fears of demise and desire for power, it was no wonder that Silver Star was very willing to accept the invitation that was presented by Ambrosius. After all, even among the chaos of the Griffonian continent, few were as appreciative and accepting of the dark arts and their user’s talents. Furthermore, perhaps due to some remnants of his pride, Silver Star believed that Ambrosius, an earth pony, nor any of his allies and subordinates belonging to other races, were a danger to him, or at least Silver Star was unwilling to admit that.\n\nNow Silver Star spends his time studying any and all knowledge of unicorn magic that can be found. All in an effort to become so powerful that nothing would be able to hurt him, and death would never be able to take him."
bar_pen_asinti_info_text:0 "“The ends justify the means” is a very popular statement among many ideologues, especially those representing the more radical parts of the political spectrum. However, if one were to bring up the means that Asinti uses, many of these radicals would be horrified, and agree that, whatever the end goal is, there was no way what the elder zebra shaman was doing to be justified.\n\nOriginally, Asinti was nothing but another slave, a victim of the brutal institution that is still dominant in many parts of Zebrica. Many who experienced such fate would try enduring, if not resisting against their subjugators. Yet it seems that most lacked “strong spirit”, as in recorded history, Asinti has been the only zebra slave that was approached by a power from beyond the material realm. This ally from the immaterium helped Asinti to free himself from the shackles of slavery, slay his former owner, and flee from those who would persecute him, eventually reaching a country established by similar runaways.\n\nThe ideals of the Kasa Free State greatly inspired Asinti, as living among so many zebras, deer, and griffons that had fled similar fates and desired to end slavery and serfdom across the world, convinced the zebra shaman that maybe there is a way to do more than survive. His otherworldly ally, like always, was supporting and helpful, agreeing with the notion, and even suggesting a rather fascinating plan. According to the creature, Asinti was a very unique individual, with a spirit that burned like a roaring fire, allowing him to interact with the plane of the divine, and thus could be noticed by deities and spirits that resided there. Most other creatures lacked such a trait and thus lacked the power to liberate themselves. But what if they could somehow be connected to this realm of the divine?\n\nHowever, this was not such an easy task as no matter what Asinti tried, he could not find what exactly made him so special. As years and even decades went on, with increasing desperation from the increasing brutality of the modern world, and with the whispers from beyond always encouraging him, the zebra chose to employ more questionable methods in order to complete his research. Eventually Asinti would succeed, and rather than simply connecting to this plane, Asinti discovered a way to transfer the creatures of the immaterium into the bodies of living things. He saw it as the solution to the seemingly eternal struggle of Kasa, even if the methods leading to its discovery had been morally dubious. The leadership of Kasa reacted to revealed actions of Asinti with horror, and the zebra shaman was swiftly driven out of the country.\n\nWhile Asinti had many disagreements with other members of the Pentarchy, the Ambrosius’ proposal and access to all the magical knowledge and resources it brought was too good to pass up. After all, with these means the elder zebra shaman could now achieve the end he was striving for so long."
bar_pen_ambrosius_info_text:0 "Once a prominent merchant and artisan, Ambrosius lived a decadent life, constantly surrounded by luxury and wealth. His true goal however, joining the elite circles of the noble class, always remained out of his hooves, no matter how much he spent on lavish appearances and rare magical artefacts. To his peers in their lofty castles, Ambrosius would always remain a haughty upstart, grasping at something just out of reach.\n\nEventually Ambrosius would grow tired of conventional life. He retreated to his stately mansion in the Barrad countryside, away from the courtly intrigue of Wittenburgh, where he began unravelling the true mysteries of magic. Lack of progress drove Ambrosius to boredom, and he returned to his usual routine of courting local nobles. They were more receptive to his silver tongue, and even began to see Ambrosius as one of them, which would later become crucial. Rumors began to float that Ambrosius was engaged in acts of debauchery that would shame the most decadent of nobles, or that he conspired with malevolent spirits for a grasp at forbidden power. These rumors were ultimately dismissed as merely fever dreams and servant gossip, until it was too late.\n\nOne day, Barrad became wrapped in fog and storm, impenetrable to sight and body, nopony knowing what transpired for weeks until the mists cleared. As Wittenland's authority had become increasingly atrophied, Ambrosius had a free reign ruling over the blasted earth, the trapped ponies remaining as his playthings and subjects of experiments. Over time, he would invite like-minded creatures to join him in the pursuit for knowledge, without ethical strings attached. It would seem that Ambrosius was finally cured of his restless ennui, or so he convinces himself."
bar_pen_leopold_info_text:0 "The desire to help others is a noble one, especially when one wants to help potentially the entire continent, if not the world. It was this desire that would define the life of a griffon known as Leopold.\n\nLeopold was born and spent his early life in the Herzlands, the heart of the Empire, and of course, one of the most technologically and scientifically, at the time, advanced region of the world. Perhaps this is how the griffon managed to survive this long, though most agree it would be better if he perished as a young chick. For since his very first years, Leopold was a very sickly griffon, with only the best medicine available preserving his life.\n\nIt was this sickness and weakness which would accompany him his whole life, combined with his genius, that would define Leopold’s life goal, which to most would be quite unorthodox, to say the absolute least. For differently from most other great minds of Griffonia, even those from universities such as Gamia, wouldn’t think of such solution for biological issues. For differently from the students and professors of Yale, he believed that instead of relying on medicine or even biological modifications, it would be technological enhancement that would allow sickly and weak to survive and reach their potential. This belief was only reinforced as Leopold managed to somewhat alleviate his own condition by the usage of magical crystal injections and enchanted machines which assist his organs. Though these additions also had another effect of greatly increasing Leopold’s physical abilities...\n\nThis sidefect led to the first of many heavily unorthodox and to many unacceptable ideas that the griffon had to alleviate the countless and growing issues of Griffonia. Instead of just using his research to heal the weak and broken, Leopold could use it to protect them from becoming as such by creating a force of griffons that through the usage of magical technology were pushed beyond the limits of their flesh. After all, considering the most prosperous and stable realm in the world - Equestria, survived through the efforts of the great few, would Griffonia not benefit from such heroes, if manufactored?\n\nHowever to most, even the most wicked of Gamia, this sounded like insanity and worst of heresies, and thus Leopold was forced to flee beyond where the rapidly shrinking power of Griffon Empire could hunt him down. In his exile he would be approached by Ambrosius, who surprisingly applauded such an idea and more importantly, the potential of the mastermind behind it, inviting him to come to a domain where such ideas could be entertained.\n\nMany years have passed since then, and now Leopold is something far beyond the wide eyed genius idealist. While initially reluctant to apply the usual Barrad methodology, the seemingly endless brutality of Griffonian collapse, has convinced the Griffon that the sacrifices are worth the potential result. Furthermore, now Leopold doesn’t limit himself to the idea of creating modified heroes, rather he thinks that Griffonia needs it’s own “alicorns”, demigods who could rule and protect the populace, and believes that through magical and technological modifications, he could become this saviour."
bar_pen_viira_info_text:0 "When we are little, most of us are told that we are special, unique, nothing like the other inhabitants of this world. In many cases this belief is shattered as we grow up and learn the world is just that much more larger and we are nothing special in the grand scheme of things. For very specific cases however, it’s different. One of these special cases is Viira the Seer.\n\nViira was born as a deer with substantial magical powers, quite the rarity for the species who rarely possessed active magical abilities. Thus since her youth she was spoiled and treated like an offspring of the highest of lords, despite her somewhat unremarkable bloodline, all while taught the mysteries of the strange magic of the deer. She excelled at the art due to certain quirks, such as her extreme hyperfocus and single-minded concentration on certain topics, learning and mastering the few controlled magical abilities deer could have at an extremely young age. This was her greatest triumph yet, but which wouldn’t really last as Viira would soon discover that many species were far more powerful than the deer, in both their countries and their magical abilities.\n\nThis was a shattering revelation to the young doe, who thought herself on top of the world. But it also gave her inspiration, after all if other creatures could use their magic to dominate the physical world to such an effect, why not deer? The issue must have been that no seer has thought or attempted of reaching such heights, or of course was too weak or lazy to try achieving something. She wasn’t like that. And of course this would also mean that there was no future for Viira in her home, thus she left to wander the world, searching for any magical secrets which could lead to a deer becoming as powerful as the magic users of other races.\n\nViira would become somewhat of an oddity in many places, a single doe wandering the land in pristine exotic clothes which most don’t recognize, to the frustration of the seer, usually carrying around several tomes for recording any new information. Her priorities and acting towards others would also be surprising to onlookers, as she would choose to speak with a simple peasant rather than the lord or flip from polite to furious all based on what sort of knowledge about magic the creature in question would posses. An exception to this pattern would be countries openly dominated by magicians, as these were the only places where Viira would show respect and even admiration, and try mingling with the elite in an attempt to learn how such paradises were created and governed. It would be during one of such meetings, that Viira would meet Ambrosius and hear about his proposal. She of course accepted, after all, who could refuse?\n\nNow Viira spends her time as one of the more distant members of the Barrad pentarchy, studying magical arts within her quarters, trying to achieve the ability of dominating the material world through her magic so that one day she could bring this knowledge and the enlightened ideal of rule of the magical to the rest of deerkind."

bar_pen_viira_clues_text11:0 "The Titan of living rock uncovered by Leopold's excavation was obviously a magical construct, but creating it would be well beyond the ability of any living mage. It must have been the same power behind Asinti's living rock and the plants that attacked the mountain villages. It's all connected, I know it, but how? I just need to find one more missing piece... Silver Star's library is the only place in Barrad that might contain answers, but I doubt he would ever let me peruse it voluntarily."
