### Ideas and advisors

flowena_holidays:0 "Class Tensions"
flowena_holidays_desc:0 "Inequality is high in Flowena, with a small group of upper class guild members having most of the wealth and all of the political power while those outside the guilds have next to nothing. The lower classes are increasingly aware of their poor situation and demand change."
flowena_banks:0 "Banks of Flowena"
flowena_banks_desc:0 "Flowena may be a city of gardens, but it is most famous for its banks. Centuries-long tradition of banking secrecy ensures all information about clients remains confidential. The families that own the banks are by far the most powerful ones and for the most part control the city's politics."


### Focuses

FLO_new_year:0 "New Year's Resolution"
FLO_new_year_desc:0 "The patricians of Flowena knew something odd was happening with the Mayor when he refused to attend their grand New Year's celebration, despite its lavish buffet. Before he had always eagerly joined and gorged on the food, so some suspected he was ill. However, he assured that he was feeling better than ever and promised he'd explain everything shortly after the next year had begun."

### Events

flowena.1.t:0 "The Mayor's Speech"
flowena.1.d:0 "As news spread about the Mayor's speech, where he would announce something very important, even the commoners were interested. When the day of the speech finally came, thousands of griffons filled the Cherryblossom Square in front of the City Hall. Patricians stood on balconies around the plaza, above the teeming crowd of poorly dressed commonfolk. Chatter filled the air as everyone wondered what Mayor Chocolat wished to tell them all.\n\nFinally he appeared, coming out of the City Hall. A podium and a microphone had been prepared for him and expensive loudspeakers imported from Equestria ensured everygriff could hear him clearly. The crowd went silent as the Mayor approached the podium, waved to the crowd happily and loudly cleared his throat.\n\n"My fellow free citizens of Flowena! Today is a truly grand day. For today I will begin to fulfill my New Year's Resolution! What is it, I hear you ask? Well curious griffons, I promised that I would make my father -- may he rest in peace -- proud of me at last and do what he always wish for me to do: govern the city and be a good leader for my citizens! I will fix all the problems in our fair and gorgeous home and make it the shining jewel of Griffonia, surpassing Romau in its glory! You can trust me to do a great job as I have learned much from my wise father who ruled this city wisely. That means I am wise as well! So yes, no more parties for poor Chocolat. I will get to work tomorrow, or possibly some days later. Rejoice! A new golden age begins now!"\n\nChocolat clearly expected the crowd to erupt in enthusiastic cheers and praise, but instead most griffons looked at him hesitantly and quietly. Chocolat's smile wavered, so he started clapping, hoping the crowd to follow his example. They did not.\n\n"Well, uh, then, I'll be going to my manor. I can answer questions once I start working. Goodbye." He made his way through the crowd, escorted by his bodyguard who shoved griffons aside."

### Decisions


### Leader descs

FLO_chocolat_desc:0 "Chocolat de Rosebrune is the son of the famous and respected Bronzino the Elder who ruled Flowena as Mayor for decades before his death in 1003. Chocolat has been the Mayor ever since, but in that time he has done very little besides host opulent parties at his family manor. The governance of the city has largely been left to the patricians and the bureaucrats, both of which have no desire to change anything as in their eyes everything is fine. Recently however Chocolat has shown desire in taking a more active role and abandoning some of his hedonistic ways."
