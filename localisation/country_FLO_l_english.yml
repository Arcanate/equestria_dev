### Ideas and advisors

flowena_holidays:0 "Class Tensions"
flowena_holidays_desc:0 "Inequality is high in Flowena, with a small group of patricians and guild members having most of the wealth and all of the political power while those outside the guilds have next to nothing. The lower classes are increasingly aware of their poor situation and demand change."
flowena_banks:0 "Banks of Flowena"
flowena_banks_desc:0 "Flowena may be a city of gardens, but it is most famous for its banks. Centuries-long tradition of banking secrecy ensures all information about clients remains confidential and vast vaults under the city are among the most protected places on Griffonia. The families that own the banks are by far the most powerful ones and for the most part control the city's politics."
FLO_construction_project:0 "Grand Renovation"
FLO_construction_project_desc:0 "The Mayor has started a massive project renovating Flowena's old fortifications."
FLO_wet_plague:0 "Peste Humide"
FLO_wet_plague_desc:0 "Peste Humide, the Wet Plague, is a horrifying disease possibly spread by black rats. It makes the lungs of the infected fill up with fluid that suffocates them. It is highly infectious and kills within hours."

### Focuses

FLO_new_year:0 "New Year's Resolution"
FLO_new_year_desc:0 "The patricians of Flowena knew something odd was happening with the Mayor when he refused to attend their grand New Year's celebration, despite its lavish buffet. Before he had always eagerly joined and gorged on the food, so some suspected he was ill. However, he assured that he was feeling better than ever and promised he'd explain everything shortly after the next year had begun."
FLO_econ_reforms:0 "Boost The Economy!"
FLO_econ_reforms_desc:0 "While Flowena's economy is steadily growing, we are still far behind more advanced nations who have fully industrialized. Our Mayor knows exactly what to do to strengthen our economy and ensure rapid modernization."
FLO_edu_reforms:0 "Expand Education!"
FLO_edu_reforms_desc:0 "The Mayor's father and predecessor, Bronzino the Magnificent, introduced free public education to all citizens of Flowena, greatly increasing literacy rates even among the poor. He also granted scholarships and patronage to promising students, who now work in our manufactories and schools, putting their skills to use. Chocolat will now follow his example."
FLO_army_reforms:0 "Reform The Militia!"
FLO_army_reforms_desc:0 "Flowena has no standing army and relies on mercenaries and militiagriffs for defence, but it might not be enough to ensure the city's safety if war erupts. Our Mayor will take swift and decisive action to make our militia truly mighty!"
FLO_construction_project:0 "A New Construction Project"
FLO_construction_project_desc:0 "The Mayor wishes to invest the funds in the treasury into a new, huge construction project. There are two proposals, both of which could be greatly beneficial for our city."
FLO_negotiate_with_pomovarra:0 "Negotiate With Pomovarra"
FLO_negotiate_with_pomovarra_desc:0 "Our relations with Pomovarra are strained at best and they do not recognize our independence. The Mayor wishes to improve our relations and is preparing a personal visit abroad."
FLO_general_strike:0 "General Strike!"
FLO_general_strike_desc:0 "It seems the labourers of Flowena have ran out of patience. Inspired by the general strike in Skyfall, they are now refusing to work and are protesting on the streets..."
FLO_feast_in_the_plague:0 "Organize A Party"
FLO_feast_in_the_plague_desc:0 "Chocolat finally admits that things are bad, but he knows there is one thing he is good at: hosting parties. And that is exactly what he will do! A grand celebration to make everyone happy and calm while Chocolat figures out what to do."

### Events

flowena.1.t:0 "The Mayor's Speech"
flowena.1.d:0 "As news spread about the Mayor's speech, where he would announce something very important, even the commoners were interested. When the day of the speech finally came, thousands of griffons filled the snowy Cherryblossom Square in front of the City Hall. Patricians stood on balconies around the plaza, above the teeming crowd of poorly dressed commonfolk. Chatter filled the chill air as everyone wondered what Mayor Chocolat wished to tell them all.\n\nFinally he appeared, coming out of the City Hall. A podium and a microphone had been prepared for him and expensive loudspeakers imported from Equestria ensured everygriff could hear him clearly. The crowd went silent as the Mayor approached the podium, waved to the crowd happily and loudly cleared his throat.\n\n"My fellow free citizens of Flowena! Today is a truly grand day. For today I will begin to fulfill my New Year's Resolution! What is it, I hear you ask? Well curious griffons, I promised that I would make my father -- may he rest in peace -- proud of me at last and do what he always wish for me to do: govern the city and be a good leader for my citizens! I will fix all the problems in our fair and gorgeous home and make it the shining jewel of Griffonia, surpassing Romau in its glory! You can trust me to do a great job as I have learned much from my wise father who ruled this city wisely. That means I am wise as well! So yes, no more parties for poor Chocolat. I will get to work tomorrow, or possibly some days later. Rejoice! A new golden age begins now!"\n\nChocolat clearly expected the crowd to erupt in enthusiastic cheers and praise, but instead most griffons looked at him hesitantly and quietly. Chocolat's smile wavered, so he started clapping, hoping the crowd to follow his example.\n\nThey did not."
flowena.1.a:0 "This clearly is a good start..."

flowena.2.t:0 "The Mayor's Economic Miracle"
flowena.2.d:0 "After several weeks of hard work at the City Hall, as well as several small-scale mostly private parties, Chocolat finished his new "Mayor's Economic Miracle"-program. It greatly reduced taxes for patricians and members of the government while greatly increasing them for the lower class. He said this was "trickle-down theory" in practice: Low taxes on the upper class would enable them to invest large sums into the economy and increase its growth, thus creating new jobs as companies, mills and manufactories expanded. However funds would still be needed to cover expenses while the economy grew, so the poor would now pay more taxes for the free public services they already received.\n\nIt did not take long for several hundred commoner families to fall into poverty and for woolworkers to protest on the streets, waving red banners. In the meantime patricians thanked Chocolat and invited him to parties which were better than ever thanks to their increased funds."
flowena.2.a:0 "Oh no..."

flowena.3.t:0 "The Mayor's Enlightenment"
flowena.3.d:0 "Chocolat's father, Bronzino, was a great patron of the arts and sciences and the Mayor aspired to be just like him. He invited several hundred promising individuals from all across western Griffonia into Flowena, trying to find as many savants as possible. Of course, he didn't have time to check how many of them were frauds or eccentric individuals. Soon a pile of garbage was placed in the City Hall, made by the "great maestro Michel" that "represented the inner rot of griffonkind". Cleaning the mess cost several thousand flowins.\n\nChocolat also intended to increase the number of teachers and thus put some of the foreigners to work as well as hiring as many new educators as possible. Their qualifications were often non-existent and countless young griffons were taught complete nonsense or nothing at all as their teachers took naps during class."
flowena.3.a:0 "That cursed fool!"

flowena.4.t:0 "The Mayor's Mighty Army"
flowena.4.d:0 "The city's militia was small but well-drilled. It was lead by competent Captains such as Nicolas de Charbon and Astrit Koch, the latter of which was a renowned former mercenary from Herzland. But Mayor Chocolat wanted it to make it larger while maintaining its quality. Nicolas warned him of how difficult and expensive that would be but he cared little, saying how he had inherited his father's wisdom and knew exactly what he was doing.\n\nHe appointed the famed Laurent the Old as supreme leader of the militia. The griffon had long been a friend of his family and was famous for defending the city during the chaos of the Empire's collapse, but was now over eighty years old. Chocolat assured everyone Laurent had lost none of his talents over the years and continued to reform training programs, making them extremely rigorous. He also reduced pay for militiagriffs so the expansion of the army could be afforded. Several thousand griffons ended up resigning as a result of these reforms, among them dozens of skilled officers."
flowena.4.a:0 "What is he even doing?!"

flowena.5.t:0 "Poverty Rates Increase"
flowena.5.d:0 "It seems our Mayor's economic program is nowhere near as successful as he had hoped. Instead of reinvesting their money back into the economy, the patricians are either spending it on lavish parties or storing it safely in their banks. The Flowenian economy is beginning to show signs of stagnation as many common workers are unable to afford anything because of the high taxes. Unrest is slowly growing and some families are teetering on the edge of starvation."
flowena.5.a:0 "Terrible news."

flowena.6.t:0 "Illiteracy Rates Increase"
flowena.6.d:0 "Despite our schools having more teachers than ever, illiteracy rates are growing according to a recent survey. Many students have received small amounts of poor education and they struggle comprehending even basic texts. At this rate many students will have trouble graduating. Old teachers demand that the Mayor sacks the horribly incompetent new teachers, but Chocolat called them jealous and said everything was their fault. As a result many of our best teachers have resigned."
flowena.6.a:0 "It only gets worse!"

flowena.7.t:0 "The Mayor's Magnificent Project"
flowena.7.d:0 "After the Mayor finally arrived at the City Hall, several hours late to the meeting, the bureaucrats presented two proposals for investment.\n\nThe first one was tearing down rat-infested slums on the western edge of the city and building new, high-quality housing in its place which would be afforable for the labourers. This would also remove the health problem in the area caused by the ever-growing rat population. The other proposal was renovating the city's old fortifications which have crumbled over the years, because Bronzino believed fortifications were outdated in the age of modern warfare. The bureaucrats themselves told Chocolat that the fortification renovation was less important and could be postponed for later.\n\nHowever, the Mayor did not wish to destroy the ramshackle houses which the poor had built for themselves with hard work. Instead, he believed renovating the historical defences would be very beneficial and ensure the safety of the city as well as maintain our historical heritage. The bureaucrats nodded and hesitantly got to work."
flowena.7.a:0 "This can only end badly..."

flowena.8.t:0 "The Mayor of Flowena Visits Us"
flowena.8.d:0 ""
flowena.8.a:0 "How dare he?!"

flowena.9.t:0 "The Mayor's Masterful Negotiation"
flowena.9.d:0 "Our Mayor has now returned from his journey to Pomovarra. His facial expression already told everything one needed to know: It had gone horribly wrong. Indeed, the Pomovarrans had been thoroughly insulted and our relations have been ruined for now. It will take great diplomatic effort to repair the damage done. Some even fear that Pomovarra might begin an armed conflict with us."
flowena.9.a:0 "How is he such a failure?"

flowena.10.t:0 "Mass Strike!"
flowena.10.d:0 "Discontent among the lower class finally reached a boiling point today as tens of thousands of woolworkers, bottlers, craftsgriffs, gardeners, teachers, cleaners and more refused to work and instead marched on the streets, waving protest signs and shouting angry slogans. They demanded better rights, better pay, better education, expansion of guild membership so even common labourers could join them and, above all, the resignation of Mayor Chocolat. Militiagriffs were ordered to stop the protests and put the commoners back to work, but they refused to obey and sat at the barracks.\n\nAs the Cherryblossom Square filled to the brim with furious griffons, Chocolat panicked inside the City Hall. Soon he ran outside and spoke to the crowd, begging for them to calm down. He promised expansive reforms and was willing to fulfill all their demands. When the patricians of the city heard of this, they were outraged.\n\nOver the following days Chocolat met and negotiated with dozens of worker representatives, one of the more prominent ones being Michael de Landau, a common woolcomber and former militiagriff who was filled with determination and charisma. However, the talks resulted in little more than promises of change. Eventually the workers calmed down and went back to work, having decided to give Chocolat one last chance to fix things."
flowena.10.a:0 "Does he even deserve a chance?"

flowena.11.t:0 "A Feast In The Plague"
flowena.11.d:0 "Mayor Chocolat had grand plans for the party. It would be a massive feast, with all kinds of cuisine from all across the world, from Griffonia and Equestria and Zebrica, and there would be performers entertaining everyone with stunning acts, and great music, and games for all ages so even the children could have a good time, and great atmosphere that would make everyone feel happy. And he would invite Pinkie Pie from Equestria to help him and ensure it would truly be great!\n\nThen the plague struck.\n\nIt began in the western borough, where the largest slums were located. They had suffered from an infestation of black rats for a long time, and now these rats were blamed for the outbreak. From west it quickly spread to northern and southern boroughs before reaching central Flowena, where the City Hall was located. At first several hundred griffons fell ill and were incapacitated before they suffocated in their own bodily fluids. Several days later thousands of griffons were ill, then tens of thousands as the disease spread like wildfire. Many were dying every day and priests were busy performing burial rites for all the dead. Graveyards across the city began to fill and soon enough graves were dug in the city's gardens.\n\nChocolat did not cancel his grand party. Instead, he downscaled it (mostly because of lack of funds) and moved it outside the city, to a deserted villa near the border with Pomovarra. Every participant told stories in turn, with one being chosen as the King or Queen of the party and choosing the theme of the tale being told. Patricians who participated enjoyed it and thought it was a pleasant break from the horrors in the city."

### Decisions


### Leader descs

FLO_failure_desc:0 "Chocolat de Rosebrune is the son of the famous and respected Bronzino the Magnificent who ruled Flowena as Mayor for decades before his death in 1003. Chocolat has been the Mayor ever since, but in that time he has done very little besides host opulent parties at his family manor. The governance of the city has largely been left to the patricians and the bureaucrats, both of which have no desire to change anything as in their eyes everything is fine. Recently however Chocolat has shown desire in taking a more active role and abandoning some of his hedonistic ways."
