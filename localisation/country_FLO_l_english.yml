### Ideas and advisors

flowena_holidays:0 "Class Tensions"
flowena_holidays_desc:0 "Inequality is high in Flowena, with a small group of upper class guild members having most of the wealth and all of the political power while those outside the guilds have next to nothing. The lower classes are increasingly aware of their poor situation and demand change."
flowena_banks:0 "Banks of Flowena"
flowena_banks_desc:0 "Flowena may be a city of gardens, but it is most famous for its banks. Centuries-long tradition of banking secrecy ensures all information about clients remains confidential. The families that own the banks are by far the most powerful ones and for the most part control the city's politics."


### Focuses

FLO_new_year:0 "New Year's Resolution"
FLO_new_year_desc:0 "The patricians of Flowena knew something odd was happening with the Mayor when he refused to attend their grand New Year's celebration, despite its lavish buffet. Before he had always eagerly joined and gorged on the food, so some suspected he was ill. However, he assured that he was feeling better than ever and promised he'd explain everything shortly after the next year had begun."
FLO_econ_reforms:0 "Boost The Economy!"
FLO_econ_reforms_desc:0 "While Flowena's economy is steadily growing, we are still far behind more advanced nations who have fully industrialized. Our Mayor knows exactly what to do to strengthen our economy and ensure rapid modernization."
FLO_edu_reforms:0 "Expand Education!"
FLO_edu_reforms_desc:0 "The Mayor's father and predecessor, Bronzino the Magnificent, introduced free public education to all citizens of Flowena, greatly increasing literacy rates even among the poor. He also granted scholarships and patronage to promising students, who now work in our manufactories and schools, putting their skills to use. Chocolat will now follow his example."
FLO_army_reforms:0 "Reform The Militia!"
FLO_army_reforms_desc:0 "Flowena has no standing army and relies on mercenaries and militiagriffs for defence, but it might not be enough to ensure the city's safety if war erupts. Our Mayor will take swift and decisive action to make our militia truly mighty!"

### Events

flowena.1.t:0 "The Mayor's Speech"
flowena.1.d:0 "As news spread about the Mayor's speech, where he would announce something very important, even the commoners were interested. When the day of the speech finally came, thousands of griffons filled the Cherryblossom Square in front of the City Hall. Patricians stood on balconies around the plaza, above the teeming crowd of poorly dressed commonfolk. Chatter filled the air as everyone wondered what Mayor Chocolat wished to tell them all.\n\nFinally he appeared, coming out of the City Hall. A podium and a microphone had been prepared for him and expensive loudspeakers imported from Equestria ensured everygriff could hear him clearly. The crowd went silent as the Mayor approached the podium, waved to the crowd happily and loudly cleared his throat.\n\n"My fellow free citizens of Flowena! Today is a truly grand day. For today I will begin to fulfill my New Year's Resolution! What is it, I hear you ask? Well curious griffons, I promised that I would make my father -- may he rest in peace -- proud of me at last and do what he always wish for me to do: govern the city and be a good leader for my citizens! I will fix all the problems in our fair and gorgeous home and make it the shining jewel of Griffonia, surpassing Romau in its glory! You can trust me to do a great job as I have learned much from my wise father who ruled this city wisely. That means I am wise as well! So yes, no more parties for poor Chocolat. I will get to work tomorrow, or possibly some days later. Rejoice! A new golden age begins now!"\n\nChocolat clearly expected the crowd to erupt in enthusiastic cheers and praise, but instead most griffons looked at him hesitantly and quietly. Chocolat's smile wavered, so he started clapping, hoping the crowd to follow his example. They did not."
flowena.1.a:0 "This clearly is a good start..."

flowena.2.t:0 "The Mayor's Economic Miracle"
flowena.2.d:0 "After several weeks of hard work at the City Hall, as well as several small-scale mostly private parties, Chocolat finished his new "Mayor's Economic Miracle"-program. It greatly reduced taxes for patricians and members of the government while greatly increasing them for the lower class. He said this was "trickledown-theory" in practice: Low taxes on the upper class would enable them to invest large sums into the economy and increase its growth, thus creating new jobs as companies, mills and manufactories expanded. However funds would still be needed to cover expenses while the economy grew, so the poor would now pay more taxes for the free public services they already received.\n\nIt did not take long for several hundred commoner families to fall into poverty and for labourers to protest on the streets, waving red banners. In the meantime patricians thanked Chocolat and invited him to parties which were better than ever thanks to their increased funds."
flowena.2.a:0 "Oh no..."

flowena.3.t:0 "The Mayor's Enlightenment"
flowena.3.d:0 "Chocolat's father, Bronzino, was a great patron of the arts and sciences and the Mayor aspired to be just like him. He invited several hundred promising individuals from all across western Griffonia into Flowena, trying to find as many savants as possible. Of course, he didn't have time to check how many of them were frauds or eccentric individuals. Soon an old broken wagon was placed in the City Hall, made by the "great maestro Michel" that "represented the coming of modernity and the death of the past". It crumbled by itself two weeks later and the cleaning cost several thousand coins.\n\nChocolat also intended to increase the number of teachers and thus put some of the foreigners to work as well as hiring as many new educators as possible. Their qualifications were often non-existent and countless young griffons were taught complete nonsense or nothing at all as their teachers took naps during class."
flowena.3.a:0 "That cursed fool!"

flowena.4.t:0 "The Mayor's Mighty Army"
flowena.4.d:0 "The city's militia was small but well-drilled. It was lead by competent Captains such as Nicolas de Charbon and Astrit Koch, the latter of which was a famous former mercenary from Herzland. But Mayor Chocolat wanted it to make it larger while maintaining its quality. Nicolas warned him of how difficult and expensive that would be but he cared little, saying how he had inherited his father's wisdom and knew exactly what he was doing. He appointed the famed Laurent the Old as supreme leader of the militia. The griffon had long been a friend of his family and was famous for defending the city during the chaos of the Empire's collapse, but was now over eighty years old. Chocolat assured everyone Laurent had lost none of his talents over the years and continued to reform training programs, making them extremely rigorous. He also reduced pay for militiagriffs so the expansion of the army could be afforded. Several thousand griffons ended up resigning as a result of these reforms, among them dozens of skilled officers."
flowena.4.a:0 "What is he even doing?!"

### Decisions


### Leader descs

FLO_chocolat_desc:0 "Chocolat de Rosebrune is the son of the famous and respected Bronzino the Magnificent who ruled Flowena as Mayor for decades before his death in 1003. Chocolat has been the Mayor ever since, but in that time he has done very little besides host opulent parties at his family manor. The governance of the city has largely been left to the patricians and the bureaucrats, both of which have no desire to change anything as in their eyes everything is fine. Recently however Chocolat has shown desire in taking a more active role and abandoning some of his hedonistic ways."
