### Focuses

#Initial tree
FLO_new_year:0 "New Year's Resolution"
FLO_new_year_desc:0 "The patricians of Flowena knew something odd was happening with the mayor when he refused to attend their grand New Year's celebration, despite its lavish buffet. Before he had always eagerly joined and gorged on the food, so some suspected he was ill. However, he assured that he was feeling better than ever and promised he'd explain everything shortly after the next year had begun."
FLO_econ_reforms:0 "Boost The Economy!"
FLO_econ_reforms_desc:0 "While Flowena's economy is steadily growing, we are still far behind more advanced nations who have fully industrialized. Our mayor knows exactly what to do to strengthen our economy and ensure rapid modernization."
FLO_edu_reforms:0 "Expand Education!"
FLO_edu_reforms_desc:0 "The mayor's father and predecessor, Bronzino the Magnificent, introduced free public education to all citizens of Flowena, greatly increasing literacy rates even among the poor. He also granted scholarships and patronage to promising students, who now work in our manufactories and schools, putting their skills to use. Chocolat will now follow his example."
FLO_army_reforms:0 "Reform The Militia!"
FLO_army_reforms_desc:0 "Flowena has no standing army and relies on mercenaries and militiagriffs for defence, but it might not be enough to ensure the city's safety if war erupts. Our mayor will take swift and decisive action to make our militia truly mighty!"
FLO_construction_project:0 "A New Construction Project"
FLO_construction_project_desc:0 "The mayor wishes to invest the funds in the treasury into a new, huge construction project. There are two proposals, both of which could be greatly beneficial for our city."
FLO_negotiate_with_pomovarra:0 "Negotiate With Pomovarra"
FLO_negotiate_with_pomovarra_desc:0 "Our relations with Pomovarra are strained at best and they do not recognize our independence. The mayor wishes to improve our relations and is preparing a personal visit abroad."
FLO_general_strike:0 "General Strike!"
FLO_general_strike_desc:0 "It seems the labourers of Flowena have ran out of patience. Inspired by the general strike in Skyfall, they are now refusing to work and are protesting on the streets..."
FLO_feast_in_the_plague:0 "Organize A Party"
FLO_feast_in_the_plague_desc:0 "Chocolat finally admits that he is not the best mayor, but he knows there is one thing he is good at: hosting parties. And that is exactly what he will do! A grand celebration to make everyone happy and calm."
FLO_quarantine:0 "Impose Quarantine"
FLO_quarantine_desc:0 "The mayor knows he has to redeem himself. The best way to accomplish this is by swiftly dealing with the Plague. And that can be done by first shutting the gates, because that's what's always done when plague comes."
FLO_unleash_the_cats:0 "Unleash The Cats"
FLO_unleash_the_cats_desc:0 "Flowena has many stray cats and some families even own them as pets. Now they can be put to use to hunt down the cursed vermin who brought this terrible disease to our fair city!"
FLO_cleanse_with_fire:0 "§RCleanse It With Fire§!"
FLO_cleanse_with_fire_desc:0 "It seems nothing can stop it. It spreads and kills without mercy, with no signs of stopping. Desperate times call for desperate deeds."
FLO_brotherly_reason:0 "Brotherly Reason"
FLO_brotherly_reason_desc:0 "Mayor Chocolat's older brother, Bruno, is currently studying economics in Middenheim. However, now he has heard of what has happened and is coming back home."
FLO_the_fiasco_continues:0 "Brothers United"
FLO_the_fiasco_continues_desc:0 "The mayor's brother has promised to aid him, but few if anyone remain hopeful. The two will have to work together and do everything they can to earn the trust of the furious citizenry. Only then can they begin to rebuild Flowena."
FLO_a_new_mayor:0 "A New Mayor!"
FLO_a_new_mayor_desc: "Finally Chocolat came to his senses and resigned before it was too late! Now a new mayor will be chosen by sortition to lead the city for the coming year."

#Non-aligned tree
FLO_revert_reforms:0 "Revert Reforms"
FLO_revert_reforms_desc:0 "Soon after taking office, Bruno started working tirelessly to abolish and undo the numerous reforms his brother Chocolat had introduced during his short reign of madness. Both patricians and commoners eagerly await the results."
FLO_encourage_patrician_investment:0 "Encourage Patrician Investment"
FLO_encourage_patrician_investment_desc:0 "The patricians trust Bruno thanks to his economic studies at the University of Middenheim. If he tells them they can profit greatly from investing their wealth instead of having it sit idly in their banks, they will likely believe him."
FLO_rebuild_western_borough:0 "Rebuild The Western Borough"
FLO_rebuild_western_borough_desc:0 "The Great Fire completely destroyed the western slums, but from the ashes shall rise a brand new borough! The architects already have many ideas for what to build and are preparing to present them to Bruno."
FLO_adelart_deal:0 "A Deal With Adelart"
FLO_adelart_deal_desc:0 "Like us, Adelart have seceded from a nation of oppressive feudal lords. It is therefore our obligation to help them -- especially because out of desperation they might sign a deal that is profitable for us."
FLO_expand_textile_mills:0 "Modernize Textile Mills"
FLO_expand_textile_mills_desc:0 "The textile industry is one of the largest sectors of our economy. Weaveries produce cloth that is then coloured with dyes made from flowers grown in our gardens. It is sold for a good profit both to Aquileia and Herzland, but the production methods are becoming outdated. New machines must be imported and manufactories expanded to accomodate them."
FLO_expand_steel_foundries:0 "Expand Steel Foundries"
FLO_expand_steel_foundries_desc:0 "With additional funds in the city's treasury and with the support of the banking families, we can expand our foundries so we can process more iron ore imported from Westkeep and greatly increase production rates."
FLO_abolish_protectionism:0 "Abolish Protectionist Laws"
FLO_abolish_protectionism_desc:0 "During his time at the University of Economics, Bruno learned the power of free, unregulated trade and the benefits it can give to small yet economically strong countries such as Flowena. Now he plans to tear down all barriers to trade and repeal many tax laws. While in the short term we will lose revenue, in the long term we will prosper."
FLO_build_rail_bridges:0 "Build Railway Bridges"
FLO_build_rail_bridges_desc:0 "Many of our trade goods are still transported on ships up and down the river, but trains are much faster and have larger capacity. With more than enough steel made in our foundries, we can tear down our old bridges and build new ones for trains which will carry our textiles to eastern and northern markets."
FLO_enter_weapon_market:0 "Enter The Arms Market"
FLO_enter_weapon_market_desc:0 "Not only is our city and its militia in need of weapons, but there is demand abroad as well. And when there is demand, there must be supply to meet it. We can profit greatly in these tumultuous times."
FLO_mechanization_of_industry:0 "Mechanization Of Industry"
FLO_mechanization_of_industry_desc:0 "While we have no lack of unskilled labourers to use for doing repetitive tasks, it cannot be denied that modern machines are far better at it than any living beings. Adopting innovations from abroad such as assembly lines and powered tools can greatly increase production rates. This may be expensive, but it will pay for itself."
FLO_build_flowena_airport:0 "Construct The Flowena Airport"
FLO_build_flowena_airport_desc:0 "As planes see wider use and continually improve, we must expand our infrastructure to accomodate air travel. Thanks to our central location, we could profit from building a civilian airport which could also be used by our own airforce in times of war."
FLO_build_cement_factory:0 "Build Cement Factories"
FLO_build_cement_factory_desc:0 "Buildings of old were traditionally made out of bricks and wood, but modern constructions require cement, mortar and concrete. We must invest in facilities to produce all these so our construction materials are the best they can be."
FLO_school_of_business:0 "École De Commerce"
FLO_school_of_business_desc:0 "Because our patricians control the guilds and thus the economy, they must know what they are doing. Founding a School of Business will allow them to receive higher education in business administration and management, which will make them skillful and capable entrepreneurs."
FLO_fortress_flowena:0 "Fortress Flowena"
FLO_fortress_flowena_desc:0 "Long ago, before Grover I's conquest, Flowena was the mightiest bastion in all of Griffonia, famed for its impregnable walls. When the Emperor invaded Aquileia however, he took the fortress with ease by bribing the garrison. Just as his brother hoped, Bruno will now renovate the defences. However, this time the soldiers will receive more than enough pay."
FLO_practical_enchantments:0 "Practical Applications Of Enchantments"
FLO_practical_enchantments_desc:0 "Magic might be good for tricks and such, but it also has economic potential. Enchantments can be used to boost production rates, improve quality of products and reveal new ways to use crystals for mathematical computation. It would therefore be wise to invest in education of magic and found a new faculty at our Business School."
FLO_negotiate_with_workers:0 "Negotiate With The Workers"
FLO_negotiate_with_workers_desc:0 "A happy worker is a productive worker who contributes willingly to the economy. Besides, conflict is expensive. There is no reason to waste money when you can just meet with the labourers and come up with a solution that pleases both parties, without giving too many concessions."
FLO_negative_income_tax:0 "Negative Income Tax"
FLO_negative_income_tax_desc:0 "Bruno has proposed a radical idea and desires to put it into practice. It is a welfare system where those who earn below a certain amount receive money from the government while those earning above it would pay taxes. The patricians deeply dislike the proposal but the commoners are enthusiastic, especially the poorer ones. "
FLO_open_the_gates:0 "Open The Gates"
FLO_open_the_gates_desc:0 "Many foreigners have expressed desire to migrate to our city and work here, because of our labour laws and negative income tax. But citizenship has traditionally been hard to obtain. By making it easy, we can attract thousands of immigrants and restore our diminished population to its former levels."
FLO_end_our_rivalry_marriage:0 "End Our Rivalry"
FLO_end_our_rivalry_marriage_desc:0 "Bruno's recent reforms have been warmly received by the common populace, but patricians despise them and are turning against him. All except for one family: The House of de Indigo, who are impressed by his generous policies. Bruno knows he needs a powerful ally to secure his position, so perhaps it is time to mend fences."
FLO_tax_cuts:0 "Tax Cuts"
FLO_tax_cuts_desc:0 "Chocolat imposed harsh taxes on the populace because of his misguided belief in trickle-down economics. Taxation rates must be returned to their former levels, or else we have a revolt in our claws!"
FLO_invite_yale_teachers:0 "Invite Educators From Yale"
FLO_invite_yale_teachers_desc:0 "While studying, Bruno met many teachers who taught him well and aided him when he struggled. Now that he has become the mayor of his home city, he can ask for their help once more and offer them well-paying jobs. The frauds hired by Chocolat will all be replaced by capable and experienced teachers."
FLO_trilingual_education:0 "Trilingual Education"
FLO_trilingual_education_desc:0 "While Aquileian has always been the official language of our city, we cannot ignore the fact that many migrants come from Herzland and some still speak our native tongue, Pomovarran. To ensure our workers can communicate not only with each other but also their employers, we must ensure everyone is taught the basics of each language."
FLO_discipline_workers:0 "Discipline The Workers"
FLO_discipline_workers_desc:0 "The commoners must know their place in our hierarchical society. They exist to provide patricians with labour and they must do so without complaint. A revolt must be nipped in the bud, even if it requires hiring expensive mercenaries. Ensuring stability and order in Flowena is worth any cost."
FLO_evict_the_poor:0 "Banish The Poor"
FLO_evict_the_poor_desc:0 "Unemployed beggars do not belong in our fair city. Let it be known that to deserve a citizenship you must work and earn enough money to sustain yourself. We do not need parasites leeching off our economy."
FLO_sponsorship_system:0 "Introduce The Sponsorship System"
FLO_sponsorship_system_desc:0 "Our workforce was greatly reduced in size by the Wet Plague. We must replenish it by bringing in migrant workers. Bruno has proposed to introduce a sponsorship system to monitor them. It will require all unskilled labourers to have a sponsor, usually their employer. The sponsors are their guardians and have complete control over them."
FLO_end_our_rivalry_murder:0 "End Our Rivalry"
FLO_end_our_rivalry_murder_desc:0 "While patricians praise Bruno's harsh policies and the populace cowers in fear, the damned family of de Indigo incited a revolt among the commoners to overthrow the House of de Rosebrune. Those age-long foes must be taken care of once and for all!"
FLO_increse_militia_pay:0 "Pay Rise For Militia"
FLO_increse_militia_pay_desc:0 "How could Chocolat even consider lowering salaries of militiagriffs? They are our finest and most reliable defenders, willing to die in defence of their home city. Besides, increasing government spending provides a good stimulant for the economy."
FLO_purchase_weapons:0 "Purchase Rifles"
FLO_purchase_weapons_desc:0 "Our militiagriffs have traditionally been responsible for acquiring their own weapons, but they always buy cheapest possible guns. How can we hope to retain our independence if our griffons use outdated black powder weapons from the last millenium? The government clearly needs to provide soldiers with proper equipment."
FLO_promote_officers:0 "Promote Officers"
FLO_promote_officers_desc:0 "The plague culled the ranks of our officers badly and we lost many talented commanders, among them Astrit Koch herself. How can our militia defend our city without proper leadership? We must promote promising soldiers and low-ranking officers to higher positions."
FLO_art_of_the_deal:0 "The Art Of The Deal"
FLO_art_of_the_deal_desc:0 "Mercenaries are ultimately merchants of death, and merchants can always be haggled with. Bruno knows just what to say to ensure they accept a lower price and fight for us longer before abandoning us."
FLO_found_flower_guard:0 "Found The Flower Guard"
FLO_found_flower_guard_desc:0 "While our militia are skilled and dependable, the patricians need a more loyal and professional military unit to protect them from harm, especially if the commoners foolishly decide to revolt against our just rule. The Flower Guard are such a unit, trained by Nicolas de Charbon and equipped with the finest weapons money can buy."
FLO_revise_drilling_methods:0 "Revise Drilling Methods"
FLO_revise_drilling_methods_desc:0 "While our militiagriffs are part-time soldiers, they still train extensively and hone their skills. However, the nature of warfare is changing quickly. Our newly promoted commanders will reform our training programs and refine them, so our militia will be prepared to fight a modern war."
FLO_doctrine_of_defence:0 "Doctrine Of Defence"
FLO_doctrine_of_defence_desc:0 "We must stand strong if we wish to retain our independence. Others look upon our shining, wealthy city with greedy eyes and rub their claws, plotting our doom. Let their pathetic attacks break upon our defences like waves break upon rocks!"
FLO_hire_rogue_knights:0 "Hire Rogue Knights"
FLO_hire_rogue_knights_desc:0 "There are many knigthly orders in Griffonia, with most in regular service to some country. Yet some knights are wandering ones, sleeping under hedges in the countryside, always seeking for employment. Bruno will meet these knights in person and offer them a lucrative deal they cannot refuse."
FLO_urban_combat_training:0 "Urban Combat Training"
FLO_urban_combat_training_desc:0 "If we are attacked, combat will not take place on wide open plains, shadowy forests or tall mountains, but on the streets and bridges of our dear city. Therefore our militia must know how to wage warfare in an urban setting, and how to make the enemy pay dearly for every building they capture."
FLO_secure_river_trade:0 "Secure River Trade"
FLO_secure_river_trade_desc:0 "The rivers to the north and south of our city are our most vital commercial routes, with the northern river being a connection between Aquileia and Herzland and the southern river flowing down from the ore-rich mountains of Westkeep which supply our foundries. We must prevent a blockade from hostile Pomovarra and seize the riverbanks!"
FLO_defend_skies:0 "Defend The Skies"
FLO_defend_skies_desc:0 "While griffon warfare has always been three-dimensional, the danger coming from above is now greater than ever thanks to bombers and fighters which can rain fire and doom upon us. We cannot allow our fair city to be destroyed from the skies and must expand our defences before it is too late."
FLO_partition_pomovarra:0 "Partition Pomovarra"
FLO_partition_pomovarra_desc:0 "Now that the threat of Pomovarra has been eliminated, we must choose what to do with the lands we have taken. Camris will be integrated and allowed to form its own militias, while Pomovarran loyalty will be ensured by giving them limited autonomy and a nominally republican government. Bruno decided that his cousin Camille will be elected as its leader."
FLO_anti_tank_tactics:0 "Anti-Tank Tactics"
FLO_anti_tank_tactics_desc:0 "The modern age brings with it not only wonders, but also terrors. Tanks are one such example, armoured beasts of steel with heavy weaponry, able to traverse almost any terrain. We must make sure our militia is trained and equipped to face such a terrible threat."
FLO_a_token_airforce:0 "A Token Airforce"
FLO_a_token_airforce_desc:0 "While we do not have the industrial capacity nor the griffonpower to accomodate a proper air force, we can maintain a small one to aid in the defence of our city and ensure we control the skies instead of the enemy. Luckily we have found independent contractors who are willing to sell outdated planes for a discounted price."

### Events

flowena.1.t:0 "The Mayor's Speech"
flowena.1.d:0 "As news spread about the mayor's speech, where he would announce something very important, even the commoners were interested. When the day of the speech finally came, thousands of griffons filled the snowy Cherryblossom Square in front of the People's Palace, which was the city hall. Patricians stood on balconies around the plaza, above the teeming crowd of poorly dressed commonfolk. Chatter filled the chill air as everyone wondered what Mayor Chocolat wished to tell them all.\n\nFinally he appeared, coming out of the People's Palace. A podium and a microphone had been prepared for him and expensive loudspeakers imported from Equestria ensured everygriff could hear him clearly. The crowd went silent as the mayor approached the podium, waved to the crowd happily and loudly cleared his throat.\n\n"My fellow free citizens of Flowena! Today is a truly grand day. For today I will begin to fulfill my New Year's Resolution! What is it, I hear you ask? Well curious griffons, I promised that I would make my father -- may he rest in peace -- proud of me at last and do what he always wish for me to do: govern the city and be a good leader for my citizens! I will fix all the problems in our fair and gorgeous home and make it the shining jewel of Griffonia, surpassing Romau in its glory! You can trust me to do a great job as I have learned much from my wise father who ruled this city wisely. That means I am wise as well! So yes, no more parties for poor Chocolat. I will get to work tomorrow, or possibly some days later. Rejoice! A new golden age begins now!"\n\nChocolat clearly expected the crowd to erupt in enthusiastic cheers and praise, but instead most griffons looked at him hesitantly and quietly. Chocolat's smile wavered, so he started clapping, hoping the crowd to follow his example.\n\nThey did not."
flowena.1.a:0 "This is clearly a good start..."

flowena.2.t:0 "The Mayor's Economic Miracle"
flowena.2.d:0 "After several weeks of hard work at the People's Palace, as well as several small-scale mostly private parties, Chocolat finished his new "Mayor's Economic Miracle"-program which was swiftly approved and officialized by other members of the ruling council, the Seigneurie. It greatly reduced taxes for patricians and members of the government while greatly increasing them for the lower class. He said this was "trickle-down theory" in practice: Low taxes on the upper class would enable them to invest large sums into the economy and increase its growth, thus creating new jobs as companies, mills and manufactories expanded. However funds would still be needed to cover expenses while the economy grew, so the poor would now pay more taxes for the free public services they already received.\n\nIt did not take long for several hundred commoner families to fall into poverty and for woolworkers to protest on the streets, waving red banners. In the meantime patricians thanked Chocolat and invited him to parties which were better than ever thanks to their increased funds."
flowena.2.a:0 "Oh no..."

flowena.3.t:0 "The Mayor's Enlightenment of Flowena"
flowena.3.d:0 "Chocolat's father, Bronzino, was a great patron of the arts and sciences and the mayor aspired to be just like him. He invited several hundred promising individuals from all across western Griffonia into Flowena, trying to find as many savants as possible. Of course, he didn't have time to check how many of them were frauds or eccentric individuals. Soon a pile of garbage was placed in the People's Palace, made by the "great maestro Michel" that "represented the inner rot of griffonkind". Cleaning the mess cost several thousand flowins.\n\nChocolat also intended to increase the number of teachers and thus put some of the foreigners to work as well as hiring as many new educators as possible. Their qualifications were often non-existent and countless young griffons were taught complete nonsense or nothing at all as their teachers took naps during class."
flowena.3.a:0 "That cursed fool!"

flowena.4.t:0 "The Mayor's Mighty Army"
flowena.4.d:0 "The city's militia was small but well-drilled. It was lead by competent Captains such as Nicolas de Charbon and Astrit Koch, the latter of which was a renowned former mercenary from Herzland. But Mayor Chocolat wanted it to make it larger while maintaining its quality. Nicolas warned him of how difficult and expensive that would be but he cared little, saying how he had inherited his father's wisdom and knew exactly what he was doing.\n\nHe appointed the famed Laurent the Old as supreme leader of the militia. The griffon had long been a friend of his family and was famous for defending the city during the chaos of the Empire's collapse, but was now over eighty years old. Chocolat assured everyone Laurent had lost none of his talents over the years and continued to reform training programs, making them extremely rigorous. He also proposed reduced pay for militiagriffs so the expansion of the army could be afforded, and the Seigneurie gladly let him reduce governmental expenses. Several thousand griffons ended up resigning as a result of these reforms, among them dozens of skilled officers."
flowena.4.a:0 "What is he even doing?!"

flowena.5.t:0 "Poverty Rates Increase"
flowena.5.d:0 "It seems our mayor's economic program is nowhere near as successful as he had hoped. Instead of reinvesting their money back into the economy, the patricians are either spending it on lavish parties or storing it safely in their banks. The Flowenian economy is beginning to show signs of stagnation as many common workers are unable to afford anything because of the high taxes. Unrest is slowly growing and some families are teetering on the edge of starvation."
flowena.5.a:0 "Terrible news."

flowena.6.t:0 "Illiteracy Rates Increase"
flowena.6.d:0 "Despite our schools having more teachers than ever, illiteracy rates are growing according to a recent survey. Many students have received small amounts of poor education and they struggle comprehending even basic texts. At this rate many students will have trouble graduating. Old teachers demand that the mayor sacks the horribly incompetent new teachers, but Chocolat called them jealous and said everything was their fault. As a result many of our best teachers have resigned."
flowena.6.a:0 "It only gets worse!"

flowena.7.t:0 "The Mayor's Magnificent Project"
flowena.7.d:0 "After the mayor finally arrived at the People's Palace, several hours late to the meeting, architects presented two construction project proposals to the Seigneurie. The first one was tearing down rat-infested slums on the western edge of the city and building new, high-quality housing in its place which would be afforable for the labourers. This would also remove the health problem in the area caused by the ever-growing rat population. The other proposal was renovating the city's old fortifications which have crumbled over the years, because Bronzino believed fortifications were outdated in the age of modern warfare. The architects themselves told the council that the fortification renovation was less important and could be postponed for later.\n\nHowever, the mayor did not wish to destroy the ramshackle houses which the poor had built for themselves with hard work. Instead, he believed renovating the historical defences would be very beneficial and ensure the safety of the city as well as maintain our historical heritage. The Seigneurie trusted his wisdom, so the architects nodded and hesitantly got to work."
flowena.7.a:0 "This can only end badly..."

flowena.8.t:0 "The Mayor of Flowena Visits Us"
flowena.8.d:0 ""
flowena.8.a:0 "How dare he?!"

flowena.9.t:0 "The Mayor's Masterful Negotiation"
flowena.9.d:0 "Our mayor has now returned from his journey to Pomovarra. His facial expression already told everything one needed to know: It had gone horribly wrong. Indeed, the Pomovarrans had been thoroughly insulted and our relations have been ruined for now. It will take great diplomatic effort to repair the damage done. Some even fear that Pomovarra might begin an armed conflict with us."
flowena.9.a:0 "How is he such a failure?"

flowena.10.t:0 "Mass Strike!"
flowena.10.d:0 "Discontent among the lower class finally reached a boiling point today as tens of thousands of woolworkers, botanists, craftsgriffs, gardeners, teachers, cleaners and more refused to work and instead marched on the streets, waving protest signs and shouting angry slogans. They demanded better rights, better pay, better education, expansion of guild membership so even common labourers could join them and, above all, the resignation of Mayor Chocolat. Militiagriffs were ordered to stop the protests and put the commoners back to work, but they refused to obey and sat at the barracks.\n\nAs the Cherryblossom Square filled to the brim with furious griffons, Chocolat panicked inside the People's Palace. Soon he ran outside and spoke to the crowd, begging for them to calm down. He promised expansive reforms and was willing to fulfill all their demands. When the patricians of the city heard of this, they were outraged. Anna of House de Indigo managed to talk some sense to them and said the workers' demands were perfectly reasonable. Chocolat was confused because the de Indigo were bitter rivals of his family, but naïvely thanked her nevertheless.\n\nOver the following days Chocolat met and negotiated with dozens of worker representatives, one of the more prominent ones being Michael de Landau, a common woolcomber and former militiagriff who was filled with determination and charisma. However, the talks resulted in little more than promises of change. Eventually the workers calmed down and went back to work, having decided to give Chocolat one last chance to fix things."
flowena.10.a:0 "Does he even deserve a chance?"

flowena.11.t:0 "A Feast In The Plague"
flowena.11.d:0 "Mayor Chocolat had grand plans for the party. It would be a massive feast, with all kinds of cuisine from all across the world, from Griffonia and Equestria and Zebrica, and there would be performers entertaining everyone with stunning acts, and great music, and games for all ages so even the children could have a good time, and great atmosphere that would make everyone feel happy. And he would invite Pinkie Pie from Equestria to help him and ensure it would truly be great!\n\nThen the plague struck.\n\nIt began in the western borough, where the largest slums were located. They had suffered from an infestation of black rats for a long time, and now these rats were blamed for the outbreak. From west it quickly spread to the commercial northern borough and the industrial southern borough before reaching the city centre in the east, where the patricians' manors and the great bridges were located. At first several hundred griffons fell ill and were incapacitated before they suffocated in their own bodily fluids. Several days later thousands of griffons were sick, then tens of thousands as the disease spread like wildfire. It cared little for class and infected patricians and commoners alike. Many were dying every day and priests were busy performing burial rites for all the dead. Graveyards across the city began to fill and soon enough graves were dug in the city's gardens.\n\nChocolat did not cancel his grand party. Instead, he downscaled it (mostly because of lack of funds) and moved it outside the city, to a deserted villa near the border with Pomovarra. Every participant told stories in turn, with one being chosen as the King or Queen of the party and choosing the theme of the tale being told. Patricians who participated enjoyed it and thought it was a pleasant break from the horrors in the city."

This is what Flowena had always done during epidemics of the past. What the Mayor failed to understand was the reason for this action. It was meant to prevent disease from spreading into the city, but now the quarantine kept disease inside the city. This did mean that Pomovarra, Adelart and Avian were all spared from the illness, but the same could not be said for Flowena. The plague continued to pick up speed and griffons died in droves. The streets were soon filled with decaying corpses and the fragrance of flowers was replaced with the vile stench of death. In sorrow, the Mayor cancelled his ambitious renovation projects as most of the workers were infected."

flowena.14.d:0 "Militiagriffs, led by Astrit Koch, spent all day gathering stray cats and confiscating pets. Once several hundred had been caught, they were brought into the western borough and released. This was entirely Mayor Chocolat's idea, as he had been told that rats were likely the cause of the plague. The cats went out into the houses to feed on the vermin and did indeed catch many of them, but then the cats themselves got sick and died in droves. One dead cat was studied further by doctors who found several small fleas from its fur. Later they caught a rat and found the exact same parasites. Shortly before falling ill themselves, they formulated a theory that the disease was spread by the fleas.\n\nSome of the militiagriffs including Astrit fell ill and died some days later, and a few cats found their way back to their owners and infected them too."

He had finally decided to change his life for the better and become a true successor for his father, which is what Bronzino had always wanted. But he had failed.\n\nOr had he?\n\nA spark of insanity lit in his eyes and he ran to the kitchen near the dining hall, grabbed a flask of oil and some firestarters near the oven, then flew outside, all the way to the western borough. As he flew he sprayed oil all around him, cackling madly and cursing the plague, then landed and used the tinderbox to start fires in multiple locations. Any witnesses thought they were suffering from delirium caused by the disease and ignored him until it was too late and the fires spread.\n\nSoon enough the entire borough and all its rickety wooden houses were aflame, burning brightly as night fell. Those griffons who were not yet ill fled in terror and flew away, leaving behind their sickly loved ones to perish. The mayor witnessed this from afar, smiling at first and then breaking down into tears.\n\nOn the next day, the spread of both the fire and the plague finally slowed down. Brave firefighters had prevented the fire from spreading to the many gardens and Eyr blessed the city with rain that helped them to quench the flames. A quarter of the city had been utterly destroyed but the rat population had died with it, and as the infected perished the epidemic lost all its momentum. It was finally over a week later."

flowena.16.d:0 "In Middenheim, the news never spoke of Mayor Chocolat's new year's resolution. The students of its University of Economics paid no attention to it, and thus Bruno de Rosebrune, Chocolat's brother, did not know what had happened until it was too late. The realization came to him when his fellow students jokingly said that Flowena proved trickle-down economy was nothing more than pure bogus. But even then he remained in Middenheim, refusing to abandon his studies, yet increasingly nervous about what his older brother was doing.\n\nThen came the news of the plague epidemic and the great fire. Chocolat had become laughingstock of Griffonia. Bruno decided to leave with haste and took the first available train to Romau, then returned to his home city on a river ferry. When he finally arrived, he was shaken to the core.\n\nThe smell of death and burnt wood permeated the city. Anonymous bodybags remained stacked on the streets, waiting to be buried while their contents rotted. Shaken and traumatized griffons begged for food and coin. Everyone averted his gaze, even familiar patricians who knew him.\n\nHe flew with all haste to the family manor, which had once been the party capital of the city but was now dead silent. The servants of his family were surprised to see him and welcomed him, but instead of greeting them Bruno fervently asked where his brother was.\n\nInside, in his room, locked inside. Refused to open the door. Sounded like he did nothing but sob and rant by himself.\n\nBruno, worried to the core, ran upstairs and banged on the door of his brother's room."

Your brother."\nSilence. Then, the door opened. Chocolat stood there, starting at his sibling in surprise. He was haggard, appeared skinnier than before and had clearly not slept for days. A half-empty bottle of Skyfall whiskey was in his claws and the floor of his room was littered with feathers.\n"What in the name of the Three Gods happened here?!" Bruno asked. "Trickle-down economy, plague, fire... Did you summon Maar himself or what?"\nChocolat looked down and for a while did not answer. Then, silently he said: "I failed. Many times. I am a failure." He lied down on the floor and drank some whiskey.\n"And what made you fail? When I left, things were going well! You were having fun parties and the Seigneurie ran the city just fine."\n"I... I realized last year that if my father was alive, he'd be disappointed in me. I've done nothing to make him proud, yet he always believed in me. Turns out he never should've. Bloody Tartarus."\nBruno sighed deeply and covered his eyes with his claws. "I should've known this would happen. Our father pampered you too much and never taught you how to actually rule. You were his favourite."\nChocolat somberly nodded, then rose up, his eyes wide open. "You! You should've inherited his position, not me! Who cares if I am older than you, you would've been better for this city! Heck, you know what, I'll resign! Fix my mess while I go hide somewhere far away in shame! I-I beg you!"\nBruno was taken by surprise, but he did not reject the idea at first. For a while he pondered, then responded:"

flowena.18.t:0 "The Sortition"
flowena.18.d:0 "As news spread of Chocolat's resignation, griffons rejoiced and celebrated on the streets and in the sky. An impromptu firework display was even held at Cherryblossom Square. Meanwhile in the People's Palace the patricians prepared for an early sortition, a random lottery traditionally used to choose who would gain a position on the ruling council, the Seigneurie. The sortitions were originally intended to prevent factionalism, populism and conflict and had worked wonderfully, but over the years the results had become predictable as patricians agreed in advance who would gain which position and rigged the sortitions. Bronzino the Magnificent's name ended up being pulled every year for several decades and Chocolat was the "lucky" griffon three years in a row.\n\nNevertheless sortition was tradition at this point and the patricians proceeded with it like always, ignoring the usual grumbles of Anna de Indigo and her family who had always been proponents of democracy. Twelve names were written on pieces of paper, then placed in a bag. A commoner was invited to draw a name and read it out loud in front of the awaiting crowd outside the People's Palace. The commoners knew it was all rigged, but did not care as long as anyone besides Chocolat would become the new mayor.\n\nThe former mayor himself was nowhere to be seen, but his brother knew he was safe, far away from home."

Gone were the misguided economic policies, the botched militia reform and the failed education reform.

Bruno suggested they could all invest in Adelart in exchange for a share of the profits gained from selling the petroleum.\n\nHowever, that wasn't the only idea he had in mind. Greifwald has no desire to recognize their independence, just like Pomovarra refuses to recognize our own. It is clear Adelart wishes to find an ally to aid them, and we could be such an ally.

So perhaps the surprising marriage proposal represented the rift between classes finally being mended.\n\nBruno and Anna were both young and unmarried, but did not know each other personally. Bruno had always been reclusive and spent many years studying abroad, and even after returning he had met Anna once or twice. It quickly became clear to many that this marriage was purely a political one, made out of practical concerns. The patricians had turned their backs on the House of de Rosebrune, but now that the family allied itself with the House of de Indigo, it solidified the commoners as their supporters. The patricians would be powerless against him, for if they wanted to remove him and his relatives from power, they would invoke the wrath of the people.\n\nThe marriage ceremony was held in the small Temple of Eyr near the city center, and was a grand spectacle with thousands of spectators, numerous performers and a huge, opulent feast.

As days passed they swelled in size, ultimately gathering tens of thousands of commoners together to demonstrate peacefully. Some griffons in the crowd waved flags of the Griffonian Republic and others held placards demanding more rights and liberty. A few griffons even flew atop the People's Palace and tore down the city's flag. The demonstrations were not violent and citizens simply expressed their frustrations with recent reforms.\n\nHowever, Bruno saw them as a political threat. He convinced the Seigneurie and other patricians that it was all a plot by the de Indigo family, who wished to incite and uprising and take control of the city. Clearly their devious plans had to be foiled before it was too late! Therefore the militia was summoned and ordered to retake the Square from the people. Nicolas de Charbon refused at first, saying it was unwise to use force against the common griffons, but Bruno reminded him and any other hesitant militiagriffs about who paid their salaries. Nicolas nodded grimly and got to work.\n\nMartial law was declared and organized columns of militia surrounded the protesters, both in the streets and above in the sky. They began pushing back griffons and beating those who stood in their way, and as the commoners refused to listen to reason, soon opened fire on them. Hundreds fled but others fought back, using stones and bricks and setting buildings on fire. Yet they could do little against armed and trained militiagriffs marching or flying in formation and only caused light casualties. The number of dead civilians continued to rise until the evening when the gunshots finally ended. The Square had been cleared of protesters and the city was safe from revolution, while hospitals filled with the dead and dying."

flowena.45.d:0 "Weeks ago the Seigneurie, led by Bruno, had drafted plans to demolish the old stone bridges of Flowena and replace them with modern high-capacity railway bridges made entirely out of steel. Indeed, several days later they were demolished, destroyed in controlled explosions one after another. The Old Bridge, the Orchid Bridge and the Hyacinth Bridge were among the most notable ones, having been built by the Mason's Guild several centuries ago and featuring beautiful statues, arches and intricately decorated pillars. Some griffons witnessing the demolitions openly wept and wailed. The patricians on the other claw calculated how much they would profit once the new bridges were complete."
flowena.45.a:0 "It was worth it."

### Leader descs

FLO_failure_desc:0 "Chocolat de Rosebrune is the son of the famous and respected Bronzino the Magnificent who ruled Flowena as mayor for decades before his death in 1003. Chocolat has been the mayor ever since, but in that time he has done very little besides host opulent parties at his family manor. The governance of the city has largely been left to the patricians of the Seigneurie and the bureaucrats, both of whom have no desire to change anything as in their eyes everything is fine. Recently however Chocolat has shown desire in taking a more active role and abandoning some of his hedonistic ways."

FLO_brudda_desc:0 "Bruno de Rosebrune is the youngest son of Bronzino the Magnificent. During his childhood he was often neglected by his father, who spent much of his time taking care of his older brother Chocolat. Left on his own, Bruno became reclusive and focused on his studies. When he grew older his mother ensured he could afford studying at the University of Economics in Middenheim before passing away. Now, after many years, he has returned to his home city and replaced his brother as the mayor of Flowena. His extensive knowledge of economics will be put to use."
