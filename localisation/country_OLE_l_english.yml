###########################################
OLE_army:0 "The State of the Army"
OLE_army_desc:0 "Our armies have always been comparatively small to our neighbours, and thus at a disadvantage. However with the advent of new technologies we can level the playing field with not numbers, but raw firepower."
OLE_doctrine_2:0 "Bringing out the Big Guns"
OLE_doctrine_2_desc:0 "One of the most useful tools of war ever devised is the humble cannon, and like any other tool it has only improved over the years. Several of our commanders are advocating for a new military doctrine that focuses primarily on overwhelming the enemy through sheer firepower, but quite frankly we believe they just like looking at explosions."
OLE_doctrine_1:0 "Deer on Wheels"
OLE_doctrine_1_desc:0 "The so called "tank" is a relatively new invention. The early models were not all that useful, but as the years went on the designs and the firepower slowly improved. Several of our commanders are now advocating a doctrine that would primarily focus on speed and mobility to crush our enemies before they can even react."
OLE_mot:0 "Kuorma-auto"
OLE_mot_desc:0 "The Kuorma-auto or the truck as it is more commonly known to non-Oleninans has recently come into use primarily for transporting goods. But several of our tacticians have suggested we strap on some armoured plates on to them and see what happens."
OLE_mech:0 "PKA"
OLE_mech_desc:0 "The PKA (Panssaroitu Kuorma-auto) is not merely an armoured truck, it is a really well armoured truck with a lot of guns on it. Truly we are the pinnacle of modern military science."
OLE_light_tank:0 "Haakon's Tank Experiments"
OLE_light_tank_desc:0 "Haakon Lurswig, one of our local proponents of tank warfare, has suggested we import some tanks from our Equestrian neighbours to experiment on and perhaps even use them as a basis for our own tank projects."
OLE_light_tank_tt:0 "Spawns §YThree Tank Divisions§!"
OLE_medium_tank:0 "Medium Armour Effort"
OLE_medium_tank_desc:0 "Surprisingly Haakon's experiment proved a success and have managed to convince most of our high command that tanks and mobile warfare are the way of the future, and thus they have commissioned slightly heavier tanks."
OLE_heavy_tank:0 "Tung Tanks"
OLE_heavy_tank_desc:0 "The Tung tanks are absolute monstrosities on the battlefield, having been equipped with 87MM cannons and thick armour plates on practically every inch of the hull, they are truly a sight to behold."
OLE_tank_making:0 "Mass Mobilisation"
OLE_tank_making_desc:0 "We've learnt a lot from our various tank experiments it is only natural that we use that knowledge to standardise production of spare parts, in case any accidents should occur."
OLE_super_tank:0 "The Haakonsønn"
OLE_super_tank_desc:0 "The affectionately named Haakonsønn is quite possibly Lurswig's greatest work, a monstrosity of steel and fire it will crush all who oppose Olenia beneath its treads."
OLE_support:0 "Organic Support"
OLE_support_desc:0 "Our troops can no longer rely on rifles and bayonets alone, modern warfare requires adaptable support troops such as engineers and medics to maintain the equipment and save their fellow soldiers."
OLE_better_guns:0 "Improved Equipment"
OLE_better_guns_desc:0 "Our enemies are constantly improving their equipment, and if we do not wish to be left in the dust we must too."
OLE_new_arty:0 "Massed Artillery"
OLE_new_arty_desc:0 "Our new doctrine calls for blowing the enemy sky high trough massed artillery barrages, but most of our cannons are either outdated or too under-powered for such a feat. We must fix this."
OLE_computing:0 "Radio Equipment"
OLE_computing_desc:0 "Considering we will be blowing up a lot of things in the nearby  future easier communication between our troops should be among our top priorities, least we wish to suffer friendly fire."
OLE_focus_electronics:0 "The Perkele Code"
OLE_focus_electronics_desc:0 "The Perkele Code, named after its creator, Colonel Spurdo S. Perkele, might be one of the most ingenious code languages ever written, with most cryptographers finding it near impossible to crack. However the truth is it isn't even a code, it's just a jumble of random Olenian swear words with Perkele's name thrown in there to confuse people."
OLE_better_arty:0 "Thunder and Lighting"
OLE_better_arty_desc:0 "We might as well integrate all we've learnt so far and blow our enemy sky high with massed artillery barrages rather than risk the lives of our deer in pointless infantry charges."
OLE_military_academy:0 "Olenian Academy of Practical Science"
OLE_military_academy_desc:0 "The newly established Olenian Academy of Practical Science or OAPS for short will prove useful in ensuring that our army's R&D department does not fall behind in creating new and improved equipment for our troops."

OLE_oppose_the_king:0 "Oppose the King"
OLE_oppose_the_king_desc:0 "Johan 'Djävulen' is an illegitimate tyrant. He has no right to rule Olenia. Higher-ups in the military and government along with the common deer are sparking protests against his rule."
OLE_The_True_Queen:0 "The True Queen"
OLE_The_True_Queen_desc:0 "Velvet, the only child of King Aldar II is the rightful ruler of Olenia. She is known for her kindness and charity work throughout the Kingdom. While she is currently exiled to Equestria, a group of supporters are planning for her return."
OLE_Coerce_Officers:0 "Convince the Officerare"
OLE_Coerce_Officers_desc:0 "The army only fights for Johan out of fear. By persuading the enlisted officers, they'll push the common soldiers as well to support Velvet's cause."
OLE_Align_The_Seers:0 "The Seers' Support"
OLE_Align_The_Seers_desc:0 "The Olenian Church has been sidelined for a while, but they still hold great sway over the common deer. If we were to convince them to openly denounce Johan and his lackeys, our goals would proceed much smoother. However, the seers are certain to request a favour in return..."
OLE_Woe_To_The_Usurper:0 "Planned Sabotage"
OLE_Woe_To_The_Usurper_desc:0 "Might makes right, they say? Burn down the source of Johan's might! Without weapons, they won't be able to stop us."
OLE_Strike_At_The_Kings_Deer:0 "Remove the Kungligt Vakt"
OLE_Strike_At_The_Kings_Deer_desc:0 "Although the army reluctantly serves the King, that cannot be said for the Royal Guard, who are some of his most eager supporters. They've accrued many benefits and wealth in the previous years by enabling Johan's tyranny. It is time to lash out against the injustice."
OLE_Return_From_Exile:0 "Velvet's Return"
OLE_Return_From_Exile_desc:0 ""Johan has had plenty of time playing King. Everydeer, I have returned! Follow me, if you wish to live in a free Olenia!""
OLE_Crush_The_Oligarchs:0 "Crush the Oligarchs"
OLE_Crush_The_Oligarchs_desc:0 "The staggering amount of corruption in Olenia is quite sickening. The wealthiest deer own entire farmlands, industries and even cities! Queen Velvet will personally review these properties and remove any unjustly earned excess from them."
OLE_Support_The_Working_Deer:0 "Help the Olenian Workers"
OLE_Support_The_Working_Deer_desc:0 "Few have suffered more than the common worker. 14 hour work days, miserly paycheck, no job security - this cannot be allowed. We shall institute fair and just labour laws, and show the workers that they don't need to resort to radical ideas in order to have a decent living."
OLE_Reinvigorate_The_Elksburg:0 "Invest in Elksburg"
OLE_Reinvigorate_The_Elksburg_desc:0 "The city of Elksburg is our northernmost population centre and a location of vast, yet to be unearthed natural resources. We should encourage its growth and development."
OLE_Seize_The_Agricultural_Centers:0 "Seize Unlawfully Gained Property"
OLE_Seize_The_Agricultural_Centers_desc:0 "A majority of farms in Olenia is owned by robber barons, who were allowed to gain this much under Johan. As such, the common deer has been paying exorbitant prices for even the simple loaf of bread. This ends now."
OLE_Rapid_Development:0 "Pushing Olenia to the Future"
OLE_Rapid_Development_desc:0 "While Olenia has mostly kept up with the times in industry and technology, it is simply not enough against the threats of this world. The Queen has proposed a program of rapid industrialisation and development across all regions of Olenia. Our citizens won't like this sudden encroachment, as we'll have to seize properties for factories and cut down forests, but the results will be worth it."
OLE_Bring_Back_The_Rule_Of_Law:0 "Bring Back the Rule of Law"
OLE_Bring_Back_The_Rule_Of_Law_desc:0 "Under King Johan's reign, he allowed corruption to run rampant. This morning, Her Majesty's Police Force launched an operation to arrest the worst offenders and gather evidence of their crimes. This should remind everyone that the rule of law is paramount to Olenian society."
OLE_Fate_Of_The_Usurper:0 "Decide Johan's Fate"
OLE_Fate_Of_The_Usurper_desc:0 "Olenia has seen much positive change in the past few months, but the matter of the former, now imprisoned King remains an issue for the Queen. How will she deal with her estranged half-brother?"
OLE_The_New_Monarchy:0 "Restoring Our Splendour"
OLE_The_New_Monarchy_desc:0 "Johan's antics have soured the citizens' belief in the monarchy. We must assure them that they won't suffer under a tyrant ever again, and that their rights will be upheld. Additionally, any of Johan's scions will be stripped of their privileges and benefits."
OLE_Restore_The_Riksdag:0 "Reinstate the Riksdag"
OLE_Restore_The_Riksdag_desc:0 "The Riksdag, or Eduskunta, was a national assembly of nobles, clergy and commoners that represented the deer of Olenia for hundreds of years. King Johan was quick to shut down this national institution. It is now only fair that their powers are fully reinstated and safeguards are put into place to prevent such a crime from ever happening again."
OLE_Velvetist_Economic_Plan:0 "Velvet's Economic Plan"
OLE_Velvetist_Economic_Plan_desc:0 "Her Majesty believes the best way to expand our economy is to draw upon the talents and magic of deerkind. So it shall be."
OLE_encourage_free_thought:0 "Encourage Free Thought"
OLE_encourage_free_thought_desc:0 "Under King Johan, the national schools and universities were suppressed, sending Olenia into a great brain drain. No more shall this be - everydeer is now free to express their own opinions and ideas, as long as they do not cause harm to others, and everydeer will have access to education for free."
OLE_New_Olenian_Youth:0 "Olenian Youth"
OLE_New_Olenian_Youth_desc:0 "With the rightful Queen restored, the overall demeanour of the common deer has greatly improved. So much, that the fawns have started to join our forces in joyful enthusiasm. They call themselves "Blue Antlers" and some even paint their antlers to model the Queen's. We cannot say no to these volunteers!"
OLE_Harmonist_Propaganda:0 "Promote Harmony"
OLE_Harmonist_Propaganda_desc:0 "Queen Velvet has long since fallen in love with the Equestrian way of life. Their ideas of harmony will bring everydeer closer to each other and build a strong foundation for the future of Olenia. Everydeer has it within them to be the best they can be, and through harmony they can achieve that."
OLE_Urban_Reform:0 "Planning Our Cities"
OLE_Urban_Reform_desc:0 "Olenia has plenty of major cities, but most of the population still lives in the countryside. This can be attributed to the squalor most cities find themselves in, being unable to properly support a large amount of deer living together. Our architects and designers will be given the task of resolving this issue, as cities are the way of the future."
OLE_World_Police:0 "Harmony for All"
OLE_World_Police_desc:0 "The joys of Harmony are widespread in Olenia. With our position secured, we can now help out the oppressed across the world, so that they too can live to their fullest."
OLE_A_New_Royal_Guard:0 "Our Dedicated Army"
OLE_A_New_Royal_Guard_desc:0 "Since we ousted Johan from his rule, Olenia has seen great improvements. But most importantly, we've reformed our army and the Queen's guard, and they now serve with pride and dedication. Long live the free Olenian nation!"
OLE_queen_velvet_academy:0 "Queen Velvet Academy"
OLE_queen_velvet_academy_desc:0 "The Queen Velvet Academy is a new national university dedicated to providing the best education to everydeer willing to enrol. Modelled after Celestia’s School, it is an institution which will ensure that never again will Olenia suffer at the hands of self-made tyrants."
OLE_join_equestria:0 "Equestrian-Olenian Alliance"
OLE_join_equestria_desc:0 "Equestria and Olenia are both great nations, but together we will be the defenders of peace and harmony throughout the world. Kauan eläköön Kuningatar!"

###################################

OLE_the_great_strike:0 "The Great Strike"
OLE_the_great_strike_desc:0 "Workers of Olenia! Too long have we suffered from the corrupt and despotic rule of the King and his oligarch lackeys. It is time we resist and fight back against the oppressors! We will refuse to work, we will demonstrate and protest day and night and we will fight back against the King's minions. We demand only one thing: The abdication of Johan 'Djävulen'."
OLE_storm_the_government_offices:0 "Storm Government Offices"
OLE_storm_the_government_offices_desc:0 "The strike has reached boiling point. The foolish and greedy King refuses to let go of power and has sent the army to crush our resistance. It's time to take the fight to the government! We will storm and occupy offices, factories, police stations and surround the homes of the elite. We will not stop until the tyrant is dead!"
OLE_New_Olenia_Party:0 "The New Olenia Party"
OLE_New_Olenia_Party_desc:0 "The deer have naturally chosen the liberal socialist New Olenia Party to lead the country. They will guarantee the survival of democracy and will not completely abandon the market economy, seeking to combine it with socialism instead. Even those who distrust or dislike leftists think they occupy a reasonable middle ground."
OLE_Energoprojekt:0 "Initiate The Energiprojekt"
OLE_Energoprojekt_desc:0 "The foundation of any economy is energy, so it is important to produce it as efficiently as possible. Old waterwheels and windmills shall give way to modern electric power plants which will allow us to modernize our industry with ease."
OLE_Youth_Work_Action:0 "Youth Work Actions"
OLE_Youth_Work_Action_desc:0 "Our public infrastructure must be expanded and the unemployed youth need something to do. The solution is clear: Voluntary labour activities. For us, it is a cheap source of labour, and for the young deer, it is a great way to earn work experience and socialize with others."
OLE_Market_Socalism:0 "Introduce Market Socialism"
OLE_Market_Socalism_desc:0 "Embracing socialism does not mean we need to abandon a market economy. No, we need to simply change patterns of enterprise ownership and management, so worker cooperatives control the means of production and the free market allocates capital."
OLE_Real_Politik:0 "Reaalipolitiikka"
OLE_Real_Politik_desc:0 "Ideologies are great and all, but stubbornly refusing to put aside your values for the sake of survival is foolish. In these dark and restless times, we must be willing to negotiate with those who are "enemies of the proletariat", because the alternative is lonely death."
OLE_A_New_Olenia:0 "A New Olenia"
OLE_A_New_Olenia_desc:0 "At last we have achieved our goal of creating a new Olenia, yet it is still the same as the old one in many ways. It is democratic, yet has a market economy like before. It is modern, yet relies still on its navy like in the good old days. We have maintained a careful balance and have earned the trust of those who before eagerly denounced socialism."
OLE_Naval_Expansion:0 "Naval Expansion"
OLE_Naval_Expansion_desc:0 "Olenia is a maritime nation, and its economy relies greatly on commerce across the ocean. Therefore it would be wise to invest in our dockyards and shipbuilding companies. Not only would we prosper, but we would be able to greatly expand our navy so we could protect our coasts and convoys."
OLE_The_Socialist_Front:0 "The Socialist Front" ###Huh I realized I misspelled Socalism in Market Socialism idea but somehow I spelled it correctly here? -Psody
OLE_The_Socialist_Front_desc:0 "After the storming of the palace in Hjortland, elections were held and the Socialist Front assumed leadership of the left, pushing the moderates to the sidelines. They have pledged to protect the working deer of Olenia at any cost."
OLE_Revolutionary_Vanguard:0 "Revolutionary Vanguard"
OLE_Revolutionary_Vanguard_desc:0 ""Rise up, oppressed deer of Olenia! The reactionaries and monarchists are trying to snuff out our revolution at its earnest! Show them that the change is inevitable!""
OLE_Resource_Nationalisation:0 "Economic Control"
OLE_Resource_Nationalisation_desc:0 "Private ownership shall be reduced to a hoofnote in history. The state must control all resources, for the good of us all. Only this way can we eliminate inefficiency, corruption and exploitation."
OLE_Political_Indoctrination:0 "Political Indoctrination"
OLE_Political_Indoctrination_desc:0 "We cannot allow old ideas to persist in our new state. They must be swiftly replaced with our politically correct thought, with a nation wide campaign to reeducate each and every stag, doe and fawn."
OLE_Federal_Security_Service:0 "Kansallinen Suojelupoliisi"
OLE_Federal_Security_Service_desc:0 "In order to contain the reactionaries and traitors within our society, who would spread anti-revolutionary rhetoric, a service that will primarily deal with this threat must be established. They shall also distribute paraphernalia to keep the population ready for war. Olenia will be safe, no matter what it takes."
OLE_Expand_The_Defense_Industry:0 "Defense Industry Expansion"
OLE_Expand_The_Defense_Industry_desc:0 "The greedy capitalists of the world look on our revolution and plot to destroy it. To protect ourselves from the looming incursion, a program to drastically expand the production capabilities of our factories will be enacted. Additionally, our firearm and ordnance models will be redesigned in order to save costs while preserving efficiency."
OLE_Death_Island_Research_Facility:0 "Death Island Research Facility"
OLE_Death_Island_Research_Facility_desc:0 "We find ourselves in need for a suitable location to test our new technologies, far away from any prying eyes and ears. The rather unfortunately named Island of Death to the far north is the perfect spot for a research base. The Seers' claims that the island is cursed is nothing more than bourgeois nonsense. It is perfectly safe!"
OLE_Direct_Command:0 "Direct Command From Hjortland"
OLE_Direct_Command_desc:0 "Our glorious general-secretary has led us well through the trying times, in both peace and war. Thus he is most suitable to lead all of our armies! Sing his praises, of the everlasting revolution!"
OLE_New_Officers:0 "New Officers"
OLE_New_Officers_desc:0 "The officers of the old order have refused to work under us. It matters not, for the conflict has shown that there are plenty of capable military leaders within our revolutionary ranks. They shall be entrusted to protect socialism in Olenia."
OLE_Workers_Alliance:0 "The Workers' Alliance"
OLE_Workers_Alliance_desc:0 "The labour unions of Olenia have gained control of the government following the elections. Although their brand of socialism is considered more moderate, they have already shown that they will not compromise to give the workers their rights."
OLE_Syndicalist_Unions:0 "Expand Industrial Unions"
OLE_Syndicalist_Unions_desc:0 "During the rule of the King, trade unions were often harassed or even banned in many cities. Now we can finally operate in peace and offer membership to all honest workers of Olenia. This way our labour force will be organized and capable of ensuring good working conditions for all."
OLE_Worker_Self_Management:0 "Workers' Self-Management"
OLE_Worker_Self_Management_desc:0 "Stringent quotas and martinet managers do not inspire a positive workplace. The workers will be entrusted to oversee themselves, with minimal oversight. Productivity is expected to take a hit initially as the workers adjust, but the benefits will follow over a long time period."
OLE_Proletariat_And_Democracy:0 "Proletariat And Democracy"
OLE_Proletariat_And_Democracy_desc:0 "True democracy is direct grassroots democracy. Our workers do not need representatives, but can speak for themselves well enough. Responsibility and authority will be shared equally in the workplace and decisions will require mutual consensus. Power to the proletariat!"
OLE_Industralization_Initiative:0 "Industralization Initiative"
OLE_Industralization_Initiative_desc:0 "Years of mismanagement and corruption have made us fall behind from Equestria and other advanced nations of the world. Decisive action must be taken if we wish to catch up and ensure continued urbanization and economic growth. The unions shall work together to expand our industry!"
OLE_Commissariat_Of_Resource_Management:0 "Establish The Council of Resource Management"
OLE_Commissariat_Of_Resource_Management_desc:0 "To fulfill the needs of our workers, we must be more careful with our resources instead of exporting it all abroad for a profit. A democratic council will be established to manage the produce of our mines and forges."
OLE_Workers_Paradise:0 "The Workers' Paradise"
OLE_Workers_Paradise_desc:0 "Olenia has become a true nation of the proletariat, where the workers decide their own fate and are free to pursue their career without an overseer to whip them. The deer of Olenia are now more willing than ever to defend their newborn utopia at any cost."

He had spent the last few days gathering troops from anywhere he could, from besieged garrisons and army bases across the peninsula, and finally had enough soldiers to restore order in Hjortland. The journey to the capital had been tough, for many towns on the route had been taken over by communists and had to be liberated before they could move on, but now they could finally see the skyline of the city in the distance.\n\nAs well as the pillars of smoke and the gleaming fires. Perhaps it was too late.\n\nManntlerhim ordered his officers to prepare the army for urban battle. The city would need to be encircled, and then--\n\nThen he saw a ragtag group of armed deer fleeing from the city and approaching them. At the front, he could see Lord Roshuo himself. Carl gave new orders to his subordinates when he saw that many of the soldiers were wounded and told them to provide immediate medical aid to the injured. Lord Roshuo then came to meet him. Ash covered his aristocratic clothes but otherwise he seemed fine.\n"What happened? Why are you retreating?" Manntlerhim asked, concern in his voice.\n"You came too late, I am afraid. The city is lost, the Palace burns. The King... is dead."\nCarl's eyes widened in shock and he struggled to respond. Roshuo continued: "The rebel scum are turning the city into a fortress. Trust me when I say you don't have enough deer to retake it. As dishonourable as it is, we must retreat. We don't have anyone to fight for anyways."\nCarl said nothing and nodded silently. Roshuo was, for the most part, right. They would need to retreat into the mountains and forests, contact allies and figure out what to do. But he was wrong about one thing: They did have someone to fight for.\nThe Queen."

 olenia.1002.t:0 "Hjortland is Ours!"
 olenia.1002.d:0 "After many weeks of unrest in all cities of Olenia, the protesters had finally prevailed and seized control of almost all governmental buildings in the country. Many disgruntled soldiers in the army had joined them and fought against their former comrades, driving them away into the countryside. Many workers and soldiers had perished in the brutal close-quarters fighting in the streets, but their sacrifice had not been in vain. The Royal Palace in Hjortland had been stormed and the tyrant King executed. Now Olenia would be cleansed of bourgeois scum and a new age would begin.\n\nHowever, while the leftists were united during the struggle, old divisions reappeared now that they were in power. The New Olenia Party consisted of various liberal socialists who were far from being dogmatic and adopted policies of a free market and cooperation with capitalist countries into their ideology. The Socialist Front on the other hoof enforced strict party discipline, fanatically wished to implement the ideas of Caramel Marks and held disdain for the NOP, seeing them as traitors to the revolution. The Workers' Alliance, a coalition of labour unions, showed little interest in politics or ideology and were mostly concerned with protecting the rights of the common worker.\n\nTensions quickly grew between the different factions and cooperation seemed impossible. Yet everydeer knew that infighting had to stop, for a divided Olenia was a weak Olenia and easy prey for foreign imperialists such as Queen Chrysalis. Therefore the parties agreed to hold democratic elections, so the common labourers of Olenia could decide who would represent them and lead the country."

 olenia.1003.d:0 "The Marshal's whereabouts have been unknown to us for a while now, but today he appeared from the shadows by sending telegrams, dropping leaflets and broadcasting on radio to all major cities in the country. In his message, he demands the revolutionaries to stand down immediately, for they had violated the constitution by seizing control of the country and had committed a heinous, unholy crime by killing the King without trial. He warned that if a member of the Jelzek dynasty was not put on the throne within a week, he and his soldiers would be justified to use violence to depose the illegitimate socialist government. However, if his ultimatum would be accepted, all revolutionaries would be offered amnesty and possibly even allowed to remain in the restored Riksdag.\n\nWe see through his lies and know the aristocrats and bourgeoisie will give us no mercy if we surrender. Manntlerhim is clearly bluffing, for much of the army has already shown support for our cause. If he does try to do something in a week, we'll crush him like a bug."

However, some of our own think she has been corrupted by Equestrian capitalism and have instead suggested the late King Johan's firstborn son Mathias Jelzek. Either way, Chancellor Vaverin will still run the goverment, but we must choose wisely..."

It seems civil war is inevitable as reports arrive of ambushes and enemy offensives all across Olenia. We shall not surrender to the bourgeois bastards!

With that, she leaned back on her throne, awaiting the first petitioner to the court with a pleased expression... which turned sour when they trotted in.\n\nA group of robed, hooded deer practically crawled into the throne room, lead by that frightening stag named Jurva. She heard rumours of his actions, such as offering animal sacrifices and living in the hostile Olenian outback. A tradition followed by few these days. Velvet could already feel her enthusiasm draining as they approached, keen on exacting their debt... She could only hope that whatever they desire, it won't reflect poorly on her rulership. Before she could collect her thoughts, Jurva began to speak:\n\n"My most gracious Queen Velvet.", he spoke in a tone that wasn't very gracious at all, "We are here to remind you of the promise you have given to the Seers. The restoration of the ancient office of the Allsherjargoði, with yours truly at its helm. The deer of Olenia have forgotten their traditions and their Gods... And we must make sure that this unfortunate trend is reversed.", he finished, giving no room for an argument or a retort. Velvet knew that there was no choice. Olenia did not need a second trouble. Not now.\n\nInwardly, she deeply sighed. "Very well, Jurva. The Allsherjargoði shall be remade for the new millennia, and you shall be the Gods' voice. I hope that will be all." As if on cue, the hooded Seers escorting Jurva have begun to walk away, in a single file line, as Jurva offered a half bow to the Queen, an almost mocking gesture. "The Seers are very pleased to hear this, your Majesty."\n\nAs they left the room, Velvet's tension almost immediately evaporated. She hoped that she made the right call."

Suspecting a hostile takeover, we have sent an armed brigade to assess the situation and find out what occurred. To our utter dismay, all contact with the expeditionary force has been lost an hour after they landed on the island. What little information we received suggests that each and every deer who lived there has... simply vanished.\n\nThis is clearly the doing of the reactionary Seers! Interrogate them all and find out what has transpired! They must be plotting to overthrow our glorious revolution with the secret technologies we've been developing. We refuse to believe that an actual "curse" exists! Sadly, until we can resolve this mystery, any research progress is unavailable to us..."
