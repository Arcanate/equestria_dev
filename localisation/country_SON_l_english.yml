### Leader & general desc ###

SON_zonni_desc:0 "Zonni Zolon is a scion of a minor aristocratic family that was never particularly influential in Zar-Hay. During the years of Mazwian rule, the family developed a negative reputation of collaboration with the oppressors, and Zonni's father even married a Mazwian mare. Zonni has carried this burden of shame his entire life and has done everything he could to prove he was a true Zar-Hay zebra. He rallied disgruntled warriors and staged an uprising against Mazwian rule as news arrived of Storm King's victory in the south. He proved to be an astute strategist and drove off the Mazwi garrison with minimal casualties. Afterwards he was hailed as a hero by the common castes, yet the tribal chiefs distrusted him still. As it seemed Zonni needed to do more to earn their respect, he accepted the title of Crown Regent and intends to lead his tribe to greatness. Once he has vanquished all the enemies of Zar-Hay, perhaps the Zolon family will finally be redeemed."

SON_kingdom_with_no_king:0 "Kingdom With No King"
SON_kingdom_with_no_king_desc:0 "The Zar-Hay were once ruled by kings and queens of the Zughe dynasty. Under their protection the city of Zao prospered and the kingdom grew wealthy. But Mazwi saw this prosperity and wanted to seize it, invading our kingdom, slaying the ruling queen and taking her foals hostage. Almost two centuries later, Mazwi suffered divine punishment delivered by the evil Storm King, yet it is widely believed the royal family of Zar-Hay perished in the chaos. We once had hope for a triumphant return of our long-lost rulers, but there has been no sign of them. The throne remains vacant and none dare seize it, fearing that the vengeful ghosts of the Zughe dynasty will curse them."

SON_summon_the_chiefs_desc:0 "Zonni has grand plans for the future, yet to fulfill them, he needs to ensure that the tribal chiefs of Zar-Hay are on his side. Only with their support will he be able to fulfill his ambitions, but it is doubtful how loyal they are. Some do not even recognize Zonni as the rightful Regent! By summoning the chiefs to Zao, Zonni can secure the foundations of his rule."

### Events ###

zarhay.1.t:0 "The Chiefs Arrive"
zarhay.1.d:0 "Chief Quaggo arrived at the capital of Zao accompanied by his retinue of advisors and servants. He comfortably lied on his palanquin as his slaves carried it through the busy streets of the capital. He was not the only chief in town, clearly, as he saw many other chiefs and their entourages on his way to the Royal Palace.\n\nAfter they arrived, Quaggo got down from his seat and ordered his servants to do what he had told them to do earlier. The courtyard of the palace, located on the shore of Lake Zao, was filled with the many chiefs of Zar-Hay who were all chattering with one another. Soon enough, Quaggo himself would chatter as he saw his good friend, Chieftess Amzina. They exchanged formal pleasantries before engaging in more serious discussion.\n"What do you think the Regent is up to?" Quaggo asked from the mare adorned in gold.\n"He'll gather us in a room so he can kill us all at once, then seize total control," Amzina said with a smirk.\nQuaggo narrowed his eyes. "Very funny. I wanted to have a serious talk with you."\n"Fine then. To be honest, I'm not sure what to expect. One way or another, he will want to secure his rule."\n"I suppose we shall see. Earlier, I told my servants to do some investigating, just in case Zonni is plotting something God-forsaken."\n"You're being paranoid, silly. As always."\n"How can we trust him? He is half-Mazwian."\nAmzina rolled her eyes. "Let's just go to the meeting and see what happens, alright?""
zarhay.1.a:0 "Wonder what he's up to?"

zarhay.2.t:0 "Zonni's Dream"
zarhay.2.d:0 "A royal slave came out of the palace, beating a djembe drum with his hoof. The chiefs in the courtyard went silent and turned to look. Then Zonni appeared, eyeing at the crowd of chiefs closely, as if he was trying to read their thoughts, and walked up to a raised dais in front of the palace. There was a golden seat on it, but only Kings and Queens could sit there, so Zonni simply stood alongside it. He then addressed the gathered aristocrats.\n\n"Esteemed chiefs of Zar-Hay! I have summoned you here for a good reason. I have a dream, and to fulfill it, I need your unquestionable loyalty. It is not just any dream, but a dream of making Zar-Hay a truly mighty Kingdom! Long have we been subjugated, treated like slaves no matter what caste we belonged to, extorted and robbed by foreigners. We have lost our glory, our wealth, and even our royalty. All this is disheartening, but I refuse to be disheartened! We should not simply sit idly as a golden opportunity presents itself. The Sky Stallion has paved the way to redeem ourselves; all we must do is walk down this sacred path. That is what I intend to do.\n\nThe Mazwian Empire has collapsed. The Storm King is no more. Now there is a power vacuum in the Great Lakes, which lies fractured and weak. Now is our chance to strike with our warriors, to forge a mighty empire surpassing Mazwi in its glory. This way, the Zar-Hay will no longer be slaves, but masters forever!"\nThe chiefs looked at each other quietly. Then, one of them began stomping the ground with their hooves. This began to spread as more and more chiefs showed their support for Zonni and his dream. In the end, even sceptics like Quaggo couldn't help but follow the herd and do the same.\n\nWhen Zonni saw this, he grinned. Finally, the chiefs were on his side."
zarhay.2.a:0 "We shall become great!"

zarhay.3.t:0 "A Wandering Warrior"
zarhay.3.d:0 ""
zarhay.3.a:0 "He will be useful to us."
zarhay.3.b:0 "We have no need for him."

zarhay.4.t:0 "Ancestral Shame"
zarhay.4.d:0 "The speech had been successful, and Zonni had gained the loyalty of the chiefs. As long as he would lead the army into battle to subjugate Zar-Hay's neighbours, the chiefs were willing to support him.\n\nAfter the feast following the meeting, Zonni left the city proper and travelled alone to a large field. There were many grassy mounds there, where the Kings and Queens and mighty chiefs lied entombed forever. He walked past them, to the burial ground of lesser chiefs, to the grave of his late father.\n\nHe sat on the ground and mumbled a quiet prayer to his ancestors, then began to speak to his father.\n"It appears as if I have finally gained their trust, father. But I know I have not. They are merely giving me another chance to prove that I truly am a Zar-Hay. But it is ridiculous, is it not? I had to promise so much to gain so little. And even if I succeed, will they accept me? Or will they still reject me, refusing to trust me because of my mother?"\nHe let out a deep sigh. "Sometimes I wonder why you married a Mazwian mare. It has brought our family nothing but shame and trouble. Perhaps it was just blind, foolish love. Or a gamble, which would've paid off had the Mazwian Empire not utterly collapsed. Either way, I do not judge you, father. I just wish I knew why, that is all."\nThere was a gust of wind. His father was answering, but he wasn't sure he understood. Perhaps his father was ashamed to tell the full truth?\n"I apologize for my curiosity. Don't feel pressured to answer. I will still love you, father, no matter what happens. And I promise to you, I will restore our family's lost honour. I will bring judgement upon our enemies. Our family won't have petty chiefs anymore but... an Emperor."\nWind howled in the darkness as the sun set. Zonni took this as a warning. "I will be careful, don't worry. I am no weakling anymore. Once I have gained total victory, I will return. I promise."\nHe humbly prostrated himself before the grave, and the wind calmed, becoming a pleasant breeze."
