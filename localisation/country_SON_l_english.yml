### Leader & general desc ###

SON_zonni_desc:0 "Zonni Zolon is a scion of a minor aristocratic family that was never particularly influential in Zar-Hay. During the years of Mazwian rule, the family developed a negative reputation of collaboration with the oppressors, and Zonni's father even married a Mazwian mare. Zonni has carried this burden of shame his entire life and has done everything he could to prove he was a true Zar-Hay zebra. He rallied disgruntled warriors and staged an uprising against Mazwian rule as news arrived of Storm King's victory in the south. He proved to be an astute strategist and drove off the Mazwi garrison with minimal casualties. Afterwards he was hailed as a hero by the common castes, yet the tribal chiefs distrusted him still. As it seemed Zonni needed to do more to earn their respect, he accepted the title of Crown Regent and intends to lead his tribe to greatness. Once he has vanquished all the enemies of Zar-Hay, perhaps the Zolon family will finally be redeemed."

SON_kingdom_with_no_king_desc:0 "The Zar-Hay were once ruled by kings and queens of the Zughe dynasty. Under their protection the city of Zao prospered and the kingdom grew wealthy. But Mazwi saw this prosperity and wanted to seize it, invading the kingdom, slaying its ruling queen and taking her foals hostage. Almost two centuries later, Mazwi suffered divine punishment delivered by the evil Storm King, yet it is widely believed the royal family of Zar-Hay perished in the chaos. We once had hope for a triumphant return of our long-lost rulers, but there has been no sign of them. The throne remains vacant and none dare seize it, fearing that the vengeful ghosts of the Zughe dynasty will curse them."

SON_summon_the_chiefs:0 "Summon The Chiefs"
SON_summon_the_chiefs_desc:0 "Zonni has grand plans for the future, yet to fulfill them, he needs to ensure that the tribal chiefs of Zar-Hay are on his side. Only with their support will he be able to fulfill his ambitions, but it is doubtful how loyal they are. Some do not even recognize Zonni as the rightful Regent! By summoning the chiefs to Zao, Zonni can secure the foundations of his rule."
SON_gather_the_griots:0 "Gather The Griots"
SON_gather_the_griots_desc:0 "Griots, the respected storytellers, poets and musicians of the Great Lakes, traditionally recorded the deeds of Kings and Queens and praised them with song. Zonni could use their help to increase his support among the commoners, but first he has to convince them to treat him like a King of old."
SON_divine_the_future:0 "Divine The Future"
SON_divine_the_future_desc:0 "How can Zonni launch his military campaigns without blessings from God and the Spirits? Not only that, but if the priests conclude by divination that he is doomed to fail, then there is no purpose in even trying. This is why Zonni must speak to the holy zebras of the country, because if the Sky Stallion is against him, then he has no hope of victory."
SON_fire_the_forges:0 "Arm The Warriors"
SON_fire_the_forges_desc:0 "The Storm King swept aside his pathetic foes with the might of his armaments, which were more advanced than anything we had seen. A new age of war is upon the world, and Zar-Hay must be quick to adapt if it wishes to prevail. Thankfully, with how unstable Zebrica is nowadays, it is easy to acquire weaponry as long as you contact the right individuals."
SON_protector_of_reemites:0 "Protector Of The Re'emites"
SON_protector_of_reemites_desc:0 "The Re'emites are horses with a strange religion who have long been the neighbours of Zar-Hay. They value peace and progress, and thus have advanced and prosperous cities. However, they have often been persecuted by others who see their faith as heresy. Zonni knows they would be more useful as an ally than an enemy, and thus has an interesting idea..."
SON_an_offering_to_spirits:0 "An Offering For The Spirits"
SON_an_offering_to_spirits_desc:0 "Aside from the Sky Stallion, the Supreme God of Heaven and Earth, the Zar-Hay worship many lesser gods of the world. If Zonni wishes to succeed in his campaigns, he must gain the unwavering support of the Holle, especially those who are associated with war. For this, he must choose a fitting sacrifice worthy of the Spirits."
SON_beat_drums_war:0 "Beat The Drums Of War"
SON_beat_drums_war_desc:0 "More warriors are needed if Zonni wishes to fulfill his dreams of conquest. Therefore the free zebras of the Kingdom shall be mobilized and levies organized. It has been many years since this has been done, but Zonni has made sure that the raising of the levies will go smoothly."
SON_rebuild_the_fleet:0 "Rebuild The Fleet"
SON_rebuild_the_fleet_desc:0 "During the rebellion against the Mazwi occupiers, Zonni used war canoes to great effect, liberating Zao with a daring attack from the lake. Now, he has ordered the Zar-Hay fleet to be expanded, so it would be restored to its former glory. Zargitau would be proud, as he was the creator of the canoe and often used it against his prey and his enemies."
SON_cast_down_false_prophet:0 "Cast Down The False Prophet"
SON_cast_down_false_prophet_desc:0 "In Macigena, an evil spirit possessed a zebra who has been preaching falsehoods to others. He has amassed a shockingly large following and now wishes to impose his corrupt ways upon the other tribes of the Great Lakes. This cannot be allowed to happen! Zonni has proclaimed the Prophet's rule illegitimate, justifying the subjugation of Macigena."

However, they are only willing to aid him if they support his cause. Thus, Zonni needs to do what he can to appease them and avoid actions that may upset them.\n\nCurrently, Re'emite support is [Root.SON_reemite_support_dynamic_loc].\n\nSecuring control of §gRe'emite enclave§! states and militarily aiding Re'em will increase support, while requesting help or committing §Rimmoral acts§! will decrease support."

### Events ###

zarhay.1.t:0 "The Chiefs Arrive"
zarhay.1.d:0 "Chief Quaggo arrived at the capital of Zao accompanied by his retinue of advisors and servants. He comfortably lied on his palanquin as his slaves carried it through the busy streets of the capital. He was not the only chief in town, clearly, as he saw many other chiefs and their entourages on his way to the Royal Palace.\n\nAfter they arrived, Quaggo got down from his seat and ordered his servants to do what he had told them to do earlier. The courtyard of the palace, located on the shore of Lake Zao, was filled with the many chiefs of Zar-Hay who were all chattering with one another. Soon enough, Quaggo himself would chatter as he saw his good friend, Chieftess Amzina. They exchanged formal pleasantries before engaging in more serious discussion.\n"What do you think the Regent is up to?" Quaggo asked from the mare adorned in gold.\n"He'll gather us in a room so he can kill us all at once, then seize total control," Amzina said with a smirk.\nQuaggo narrowed his eyes. "Very funny. I wanted to have a serious talk with you."\n"Fine then. To be honest, I'm not sure what to expect. One way or another, he will want to secure his rule."\n"I suppose we shall see. Earlier, I told my servants to do some investigating, just in case Zonni is plotting something God-forsaken."\n"You're being paranoid, silly. As always."\n"How can we trust him? He is half-Mazwian."\nAmzina rolled her eyes. "Let's just go to the meeting and see what happens, alright?""
zarhay.1.a:0 "Wonder what he's up to?"

zarhay.2.t:0 "Zonni's Dream"
zarhay.2.d:0 "A royal slave came out of the palace, beating a djembe drum with his hoof. The chiefs in the courtyard went silent and turned to look. Then Zonni appeared, eyeing at the crowd of chiefs closely, as if he was trying to read their thoughts, and walked up to a raised dais in front of the palace. There was a golden seat on it, but only Kings and Queens could sit there, so Zonni simply stood alongside it. He then addressed the gathered aristocrats.\n\n"Esteemed chiefs of Zar-Hay! I have summoned you here for a good reason. I have a dream, and to fulfill it, I need your unquestionable loyalty. It is not just any dream, but a dream of making Zar-Hay a truly mighty Kingdom! Long have we been subjugated, treated like slaves no matter what caste we belonged to, extorted and robbed by foreigners. We have lost our glory, our wealth, and even our royalty. All this is disheartening, but I refuse to be disheartened! We should not simply sit idly as a golden opportunity presents itself. The Sky Stallion has paved the way to redeem ourselves; all we must do is walk down this sacred path. That is what I intend to do.\n\nThe Mazwian Empire has collapsed. The Storm King is no more. Now there is a power vacuum in the Great Lakes, which lies fractured and weak. Now is our chance to strike with our warriors, to forge a mighty empire surpassing Mazwi in its glory. This way, the Zar-Hay will no longer be slaves, but masters forever!"\n\nThe chiefs looked at each other quietly. Then, one of them began stomping the ground with their hooves. This began to spread as more and more chiefs showed their support for Zonni and his dream. In the end, even sceptics like Quaggo couldn't help but follow the herd and do the same.\n\nWhen Zonni saw this, he grinned. Finally, the chiefs were on his side."
zarhay.2.a:0 "We shall become great!"

zarhay.3.t:0 "A Wandering Warrior"
zarhay.3.d:0 "It seemed word of Zonni's ambitions had spread quickly, because a warrior claiming to come from a distant land requested audience with the Regent. Zonni, always in need of capable soldiers, agreed to meet him.\n\nThe warrior introduced himself as Ture Sylla, and said he had fought under many rulers over the years in return for pay. Now he offered his experience and skill to Zonni, because he believed he would be victorious in the coming wars of unification, and wanted to be on the winning side.\n\nZonni was very tempted by this offer, but he wondered what the chiefs would think if he allowed a foreigner to lead their troops into battle? Perhaps it wasn't worthwhile, as he didn't want to lose their trust. Then again, a competent leader like Ture Sylla was just what he needed to aid him in his conquests."
zarhay.3.a:0 "He will be useful to us."
zarhay.3.b:0 "We have no need for him."

zarhay.4.t:0 "Ancestral Shame"
zarhay.4.d:0 "The speech had been successful, and Zonni had gained the loyalty of the chiefs. As long as he would lead the army into battle to subjugate Zar-Hay's neighbours, the chiefs were willing to support him.\n\nAfter the feast following the meeting, Zonni left the city proper and travelled alone to a large field. There were many grassy mounds there, where the Kings and Queens and mighty chiefs lied entombed forever. He walked past them, to the burial ground of lesser chiefs, to the grave of his late father.\n\nHe sat on the ground and mumbled a quiet prayer to his ancestors, then began to speak to his father.\n"It appears as if I have finally gained their trust, father. But I know I have not. They are merely giving me another chance to prove that I truly am a Zar-Hay. But it is ridiculous, is it not? I had to promise so much to gain so little. And even if I succeed, will they accept me? Or will they still reject me, refusing to trust me because of my mother?"\nHe let out a deep sigh. "Sometimes I wonder why you married a Mazwian mare. It has brought our family nothing but shame and trouble. Perhaps it was just blind, foolish love. Or a gamble, which would've paid off had the Mazwian Empire not utterly collapsed. Either way, I do not judge you, father. I just wish I knew why, that is all."\nThere was a gust of wind. His father was answering, but he wasn't sure he understood. Perhaps his father was ashamed to tell the full truth?\n"I apologize for my curiosity. Don't feel pressured to answer. I will still love you, father, no matter what happens. And I promise to you, I will restore our family's lost honour. I will bring judgement upon our enemies. Our family won't have petty chiefs anymore but... an Emperor."\nWind howled in the darkness as the sun set. Zonni took this as a warning. "I will be careful, don't worry. I am no weakling anymore. Once I have gained total victory, I will return. I promise."\nHe humbly prostrated himself before the grave, and the wind calmed, becoming a pleasant breeze."
zarhay.4.a:0 "Once I come back, I will be a true Zar-Hay."

zarhay.5.t:0 "The Praise-Singers"
zarhay.5.d:0 "Fassa Balleke was a famed griot, whose ancestors had been in the court of the Zar-Hay monarch. But ever since the Mazwian invasion, they had lived in exile, wandering the land and entertaining countless chiefs and petty kings. When the Regent of Zar-Hay offered her a position in his court, she was at first sceptical, as griots traditionally served rulers, not mere regents. But in these tumultuous times, she couldn't simply refuse a job offer like that.\n\nWhen she arrived at the Royal Palace, she quickly realized she wasn't the only griot who had been invited there. Some of the griots she recognized, yet others appeared obscure and unpopular. The Regent had cast a very wide net in his search for griots.\n\nThen Zonni came out to meet them. "Greetings, honoured griots, and welcome to the Royal Palace! These walls have not heard your music or song in so many years, yet this shall now change. I know some of you may be wondering why a mere Regent would have a need for you. No, I do not intend to become King. However, I do need your aid. You see, I need popular support for my grand unification campaigns which I have planned. I need talented speakers and entertainers like you to spread the word among the commoners, glorifying my rule, drumming up support for my cause and recording my deeds for the future generations. In return, I will offer you a generous share of the spoils of war. I swear on the Spirits that you will become rich."\n\nTo some it might have seemed like an unpleasant job, but for Fassa it was nothing out of the ordinary. Such was the usual duty of the griot caste. However, in her heart she feared that the Regent's gamble would fail, that he would be defeated and his griots enslaved. But as she looked around the Palace, she felt like she was finally back home. She prayed to God, and stepped forth to accept Zonni as her new patron."
zarhay.5.a:0 "Our fates are now entwined."

zarhay.6.t:0 "The Wind-Singers"
zarhay.6.d:0 "Zonni uncovered his head as he entered a hallowed sanctuary of the Wind-Singers. The white-robed priests inside nodded in greeting. "We have expected you, scion of Zolon," the eldest of the priests said.\nZonni raised an eyebrow. "How? I did not inform you of my arrival."\n"The Spirits told us. They also said you've come to see the future."\n"Yes. If the Spirits told you that, then clearly I can trust you to conduct a divination and reveal my fate to me."\nOne of the other priests shook her head. "Fate is fickle. Visions are unclear. Future is always in flux."\n"The further away we look, the harder it becomes to see," the eldest priest added. "But perhaps the Spirits are in a generous mood today."\n"I pray it is so," Zonni replied. "Please, tell me if my dream is doomed to fail, if I should bother waging war in the first place. That is all I wish to know."\nThe priests looked at one another, then nodded. "Then come, to conduct a proper divination we must do so in the open," the eldest said.\n\nThe zebras left the sanctuary and walked to a nearby open field. They spread out a pure white cloth with painted markings and symbols on the grass. One of the priests had brought with him a pouch, which he gave to the eldest Wind-Singer. The priests stood and waited for the wind to pick up, and when there was a gust of wind, the priests hummed and the eldest one threw out the contents of the pouch into the wind. Bone fragments, gemstones, amulets and carved dice were scattered by the wind onto the cloth. As the wind died down, so did the humming of the priests. The eldest one then sat down in front of the cloth and began to study the pattern created by the objects.\n"What do you see, elder?" Zonni asked, curious and eager.\nThe eldest furrowed his brow. "I see... a dead lion," he said and pointed at several items on the cloth. "And a white-backed vulture, swooping in to feast on its flesh."\nZonni's eyes widened. "I see what this means. The lion is Mazwi, and I am the vulture!"\nThe eldest narrowed his eyes. "But then a hidden hunter appears from the bush and scares the vulture away, claiming the lion's remains."\nZonni frowned. "Hrm. Sounds like I need to be careful, or I will lose it all."\n"You are interpreting the signs well enough," the eldest said. "But remember what was said. The future is not set in stone. The vulture may yet feast on the lion."\nZonni nodded, and smiled confidently."
zarhay.6.a:0 "It is a good sign, thank God."

zarhay.7.t:0 "New Tools Of Death"
zarhay.7.d:0 "Gunsmiths were among the most respected members of the artisan caste, capable of assembling intricate weaponry from metal. Before, they had made fine swords of steel, but in recent decades they had learned to make muskets instead. In this time of rapid change, they would have to adapt yet again.\n\nZonni entered the courtyard of the gunsmith's workshop, where the local guild masters and their students were already waiting. On his back, Zonni carried a weapon which immediately attracted the attention of the smiths. He stopped in front of the audience members who bowed in respect, and took out the gun. "Greetings, esteemed gunsmiths. Do any of you know what this is?"\nThe gunsmiths looked at each other in doubt. "Is it some kind of musket?" one of them asked.\nZonni chuckled. "Almost correct. This, my friends, is a rifle. Allow me to demonstrate how it works." He motioned to his servants who brought out a blindfolded female prisoner into the courtyard, guiding it to stand in front of a mudbrick wall. It was a slave who had tried to kill its owner and had thus been condemned to death.\n\nZonni stood up on his hind legs, loaded the rifle, took aim and fired. A loud bang echoed in the courtyard as the slave dropped dead in an instant. The gunsmiths looked in awe, their mouths wide open. Zonni smiled as he turned to face them again. "As you can see, it is far more accurate than a musket, and produces less smoke. I have spent a fortune acquiring these from a dealer in Tobuck. Your task will be to dismantle and study this weapon, so we may learn to make it ourselves. I trust you will do a fine job in service to the Kingdom, and receive a handsome reward in return." Zonni gave the rifle to the nearest gunsmith, who prostrated herself on the ground, deeply grateful."
zarhay.7.a:0 "May God bless these weapons."

zarhay.8.t:0 "Zonni Zolon Vows To Protect Re'emites"
zarhay.8.d:0 "In a strange turn of events, Zonni Zolon, the Crown Regent of the Kingdom of Zar-Hay, has sworn to protect Re'emites from any outside aggression. This pledge of protection extends to any Re'emite minorities living within territory under Zar-Hay control.\n\nHowever, he was quick to make it clear that he is not doing this out of the goodness of his heart, and said Re'em would have to provide his nation aid in return. This help did not have to be military in nature, as Re'em could help develop the underdeveloped country in return and work to eliminate poverty. [Root.GetLeader] has accepted this, as Re'em has already done much to aid the zebras of the Great Lakes. Besides, if Zonni grows stronger, he will be a powerful ally for Re'em, ensuring its survival in the future."
zarhay.8.a:0 "Thank you..?"

zarhay.9.t:0 "A Worthy Sacrifice"
zarhay.9.d:0 "Zonni had ordered a sacrificial ceremony to be held by the priesthood of Zao in preparation for the wars he was about to wage. The Wind-Singers got to work, and Zonni assumed he did not need to get involved himself. However, one of the priests approached him and requested him to decide what would be sacrificed. Traditionally, it had been the decision of the Kings and Queens, but as Zonni was the royal regent, the responsibility was now on his shoulders.\n\nZonni pondered deeply, for the decision was vital. If the right sacrifice was not made, the spirits would be displeased and cast a curse on him. On the other hoof, if he chose correctly, then the spirits would bless his ambitions and further ensure he'd prevail on the battlefield. The most important spirits to appease were Zabera, grandfather of war, Muawri, god of the hunt, and Zargitau, the founder of Zao and the progenitor of Zar-Hay. The custom offering consisted of fresh kola nuts, divided into four lobes. Zabera was known to be especially fond of the bittersweet seeds. But Zonni was unsure if this was a fitting sacrifice, as the coming wars weren't a mere skirmish or raid, and possibly required a greater sacrifice. Dogs were favourite animals of Zargitau and close companions of Muawri, so they'd be pleased by such a offering. Yet even this did not feel like enough. Perhaps a grand sacrifice was in place, to truly impress the spirits and show them that Zonni was in great need of their blessing? For that, 444 slaves would suffice. It was a sacred number and ritual killings of slaves were acceptable in Zar-Hay society. But perhaps it was too much...\n\nEventually, Zonni finally made the decision, and revealed it to the Wind-Singers."
zarhay.9.a:0 "Offer kola nuts."
zarhay.9.b:0 "Offer the life of a dog."
zarhay.9.c:0 "Offer the lives of 444 slaves."

zarhay.10.t:0 "Gathering The Warriors"
zarhay.10.d:0 "As far as Zonni was concerned, every capable zebra in the Kingdom was a potential soldier. As the clouds of war were gathering, so too would the levied troops of Zar-Hay. They would provide crucial support for the more professional royal guard and the chieftains' personal armies. Zonni had done much work in preparation to organize the mustering of soldiers, hiring administrators, establishing a regional command hierarchy and bribing the right zebras to ensure it would go smoothly. He was not inventing everything new, of course, just renovating the old levy system of the Kingdom that had not been used since before the Mazwians had ended their independence centuries ago.\n\nSoon, the war drums were beaten across the nation and zebras were called to arms. Many began gathering in the centers of their towns and villages where Zonni's commanders were overseeing the mustering. Each zebra brought their own equipment and rations, many armed with crude muskets, swords, spears or bows. Units were formed and the conscripts were assigned officers from the ranks of the aristocracy. Then these units would march to Zao, where the levies would swear allegiance to the Regent.\n\nZonni was proud to see thousands of soldiers gathering in the capital. The mustering had gone well, and while many villages had now lost able-bodied workers, they'd be back home eventually. Dead or alive. What mattered to Zonni was that his army was now strong enough to face the challenges ahead of them."
