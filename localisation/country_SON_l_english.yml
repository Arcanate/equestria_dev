### Leader & general desc ###

SON_zonni_desc:0 "Zonni Zolon is a scion of a minor aristocratic family that was never particularly influential in Zar-Hay. During the years of Mazwian rule, the family developed a negative reputation of collaboration with the oppressors, and Zonni's father even married a Mazwian mare. Zonni has carried this burden of shame his entire life and has done everything he could to prove he was a true Zar-Hay zebra. He rallied disgruntled warriors and staged an uprising against Mazwian rule as news arrived of Storm King's victory in the south. He proved to be an astute strategist and drove off the Mazwi garrison with minimal casualties. Afterwards he was hailed as a hero by the common castes, yet the tribal chiefs distrusted him still. As it seemed Zonni needed to do more to earn their respect, he accepted the title of Crown Regent and intends to lead his tribe to greatness. Once he has vanquished all the enemies of Zar-Hay, perhaps the Zolon family will finally be redeemed."

SON_kingdom_with_no_king:0 "Kingdom Without A King"
SON_kingdom_with_no_king_desc:0 "The Zar-Hay were once ruled by kings and queens of the Zughe dynasty. Under their protection the city of Zao prospered and the kingdom grew wealthy. But Mazwi saw this prosperity and wanted to seize it, invading the kingdom, slaying its ruling queen and taking her foals hostage. Almost two centuries later, Mazwi suffered divine punishment delivered by the evil Storm King, yet it is widely believed the royal family of Zar-Hay perished in the chaos. We once had hope for a triumphant return of our long-lost rulers, but there has been no sign of them. The throne remains vacant and none dare seize it, fearing that the vengeful ghosts of the Zughe dynasty will curse them."

### Advisors & Concerns ###

SON_famed_griot:0 "Fassa Balleke"
SON_famed_griot_desc:0 "The Balleke family had once served the Zar-Hay kings and queens as court griots, yet after the Mazwian subjugation they had no choice but to go into exile, becoming wandering entertainers. The youngest scion of the family, Fasse Balleke, has now returned to her homeland to serve in the court once more. She is a talented musician and has fully memorized the most important Zar-Hay mythologies and historical records. She has proven to be quite popular, and oftentimes commoners gather outside the palace to listen to her performances."
SON_chief_quaggo:0 "Chief Quaggo"
SON_chief_quaggo_desc:0 "Quaggo is the most prominent chief of Zairbanda. His family is old and respected, surviving Mazwian rule mostly intact despite harbouring deep hatred for the foreign overlords. While they have lost much of their wealth and power over the years, their prestige remains high and thus Quaggo's voice has more weight than that of most chieftains. Quaggo himself is known to be paranoid of foreigners and is especially distrustful of Zonni Zolon, the half-Mazwian regent. He eagerly anticipates the return of the rightful pure-blooded King to the throne of Zar-Hay."
SON_chieftess_amzina:0 "Chieftess Amzina"
SON_chieftess_amzina_desc:0 "Coming from the Anzongo tribe, Amzina's family rose from obscurity in recent decades thanks to savvy trade policies which made them exceptionally prosperous. Unlike more conservative tribes who remain stuck in the past, Amzina and her relatives have embraced change and rapidly adapted. Now Anzongo, once a rural province, has thriving proto-industry mostly thanks to cooperation with the local Re'emite minority. Amzina has ensured the Neighle trade route remains secure, her war canoes patrolling the waterways and gathering lucrative tolls from merchants in return."
SON_chief_faran:0 "Chief Faran"
SON_chief_faran_desc:0 "Chief Faran of Zarabara is the son of a powerful sorcerer and has followed in his hoofsteps. While his tribe is rather poor, he is still honoured as a skilled potion brewer and a master of the arcane arts. Little is known about him as he lets his deeds speak on his behalf. It is a mixture of both fear and respect that makes Faran a very influential zebra in Zar-Hay."

SON_chieftess_meynsata:0 "Chieftess Meynsata"
SON_chieftess_meynsata_desc:0 "The Zibiridugu tribe are considered strange in the rest of Zar-Hay, due to their different culture and bizarre dialect. Yet they insist to be proud subjects of Zar-Hay, having been part of the Kingdom for centuries before the rise of Imperial Mazwi. While Mazwi had annexed their lands directly, separating it from Zar-Hay, Chieftess Meynsata led a fearsome resistance to drive out the garrison and reunite with the Kingdom. Meynsata is known to be a capable warrior, having slain many foes with her spear. Zonni Zolon holds particularly deep respect for her abilities."
SON_captain_zaghe:0 "Captain Zaghe"
SON_captain_zaghe_desc:0 "Zaghe is the head of the royal retinue, usually responsible for the safety of the King. When there is no King, it is their duty to guard the Regent instead. Zaghe knows the shame of his predecessors in the past who failed to save Queen of Zar-Hay from becoming a Mazwian hostage, and is determined to redeem the stained honour of his position."
SON_chief_monzon:0 "Chief Monzon"
SON_chief_monzon_desc:0 "Before the rise of Zekuris, the False Prophet, Monzon's father was the chief of Macigena, serving the Mazwian Manza. He had tried to stop the inflammatory speeches of Zekuris, but this only resulted in a large uprising which ended in his death. His son, Monzon, managed to escape and organized a small resistance movement against the wrathful zealots. When Zonni Zolon led his armies into Macigena, he welcomed them as liberators and did what he could to aid them, hoping that he could regain control of his father's chiefdom. Indeed, his hopes have been fulfilled and he is now willing to serve the Kingdom - but his loyalty is questionable, as he'd rather be an independent, sovereign ruler than a subject."
SON_zogon:0 "Drillmaster Zogon"
SON_zogon_desc:0 "A harsh zebra, yet only as harsh as it is necessary to be. Zogon is feared by the common soldier and respected by the commanding officers. A former slavemaster, he has plentiful experience from whipping disobedient zebras back into shape. Zonni recognized his skills and realized their usefulness in the military, thus offering him a position in his army."

### Foci ###

SON_summon_the_chiefs:0 "Summon The Chiefs"
SON_summon_the_chiefs_desc:0 "Zonni has grand plans for the future, yet to fulfill them, he needs to ensure that the tribal chiefs of Zar-Hay are on his side. Only with their support will he be able to fulfill his ambitions, but it is doubtful how loyal they are. Some do not even recognize Zonni as the rightful Regent! By summoning the chiefs to Zao, Zonni can secure the foundations of his rule."
SON_gather_the_griots:0 "Gather The Griots"
SON_gather_the_griots_desc:0 "Griots, the respected storytellers, poets and musicians of the Great Lakes, traditionally recorded the deeds of Kings and Queens and praised them with song. Zonni could use their help to increase his support among the commoners, but first he has to convince them to treat him like a King of old."
SON_divine_the_future:0 "Divine The Future"
SON_divine_the_future_desc:0 "How can Zonni launch his military campaigns without blessings from God and the Spirits? Not only that, but if the priests conclude by divination that he is doomed to fail, then there is no purpose in even trying. This is why Zonni must speak to the holy zebras of the country, because if the Sky Stallion is against him, then he has no hope of victory."
SON_fire_the_forges:0 "Arm The Warriors"
SON_fire_the_forges_desc:0 "The Storm King swept aside his pathetic foes with the might of his armaments, which were more advanced than anything we had seen. A new age of war is upon the world and Zar-Hay must be quick to adapt if it wishes to prevail. Thankfully, with how unstable Zebrica is nowadays, it is easy to acquire weaponry as long as you contact the right individuals."
SON_protector_of_reemites:0 "Protector Of The Re'emites"
SON_protector_of_reemites_desc:0 "The Re'emites are horses with a strange religion who have long been the neighbours of Zar-Hay. They value peace and progress and thus have advanced and prosperous cities. However, they have often been persecuted by others who see their faith as heresy. Zonni knows they would be more useful as an ally than an enemy, and has an interesting idea..."
SON_an_offering_to_spirits:0 "An Offering For The Spirits"
SON_an_offering_to_spirits_desc:0 "Aside from the Sky Stallion, the Supreme God of Heaven and Earth, the Zar-Hay worship many lesser gods of the world. If Zonni wishes to succeed in his campaigns, he must gain the unwavering support of the Holle, especially those who are associated with war. For this, he must choose a fitting sacrifice worthy of the Spirits."
SON_beat_drums_war:0 "Beat The Drums Of War"
SON_beat_drums_war_desc:0 "More warriors are needed if Zonni wishes to fulfill his dreams of conquest. Therefore the free zebras of the Kingdom shall be mobilized and levies organized. It has been many years since this has been done, but Zonni has made sure that the raising of the levies will go smoothly."
SON_rebuild_the_fleet:0 "Rebuild The Fleet"
SON_rebuild_the_fleet_desc:0 "During the rebellion against the Mazwi occupiers, Zonni used war canoes to great effect, liberating Zao with a daring attack from the lake. Now, he has ordered the Zar-Hay fleet to be expanded, so it would be restored to its former glory. Zargitau would be proud, as he was the creator of the canoe and often used it against his prey and his enemies."
SON_cast_down_false_prophet:0 "Cast Down The False Prophet"
SON_cast_down_false_prophet_desc:0 "In Macigena, an evil spirit possessed a zebra who has been preaching falsehoods to others. He has amassed a shockingly large following and now wishes to impose his corrupt ways upon the other tribes of the Great Lakes. This cannot be allowed to happen! Zonni has proclaimed the Prophet's rule illegitimate, justifying the subjugation of Macigena."
SON_mercy_for_warriors:0 "Mercy For The Warriors"
SON_mercy_for_warriors_desc:0 "Some of those who fought for the false prophet were not fanatics blinded by their zealotry, but regular warriors who were loyal to their tribes. These warriors simply fulfilled their duty and Zonni respects their skills at fighting. Now he shall offer to spare them if they swear oaths of loyalty to him, and him alone."
SON_burn_the_zealots:0 "Burn The Zealots"
SON_burn_the_zealots_desc:0 "He who led zebras astray has been captured, along with his most prominent followers. They will now be dealt with and punished for their misguided actions. Without their leader, the mad cultists will become disorganized and their cause will waver. Thus, they should threaten anyone no longer."
SON_religious_freedom:0 "Freedom Of Faith"
SON_religious_freedom_desc:0 "The dogmatists tried to force all zebras of Macigena to practice their religion in a single, unified way, persecuting and punishing those who refused to do so. Now that the reign of the deceiver is over, Zonni has announced that everyone can worship the gods in whatever way they wish, without having to fear for their lives."
SON_governor_of_macigena:0 "Restore The Chiefs"
SON_governor_of_macigena_desc:0 "The time has come to integrate the tribes of Macigena into the Kingdom of Zar-Hay. They are welcome in the Kingdom, and Zonni will fully restore the power of the chiefs who were overthrown by the mad fanatics. In return, they shall swear oaths of loyalty to the crown, acknowledging the Regent as their rightful ruler."
SON_the_fallen_kingdom:0 "The Fallen Kingdom"
SON_the_fallen_kingdom_desc:0 "To the north, the King of Alwani attempted to restore his broken realm after the end of Mazwian rule, but the city of Timbucktu defied him and refused to bend the knee. Alwani is clearly a mere shadow of its former self and should be easily crushed by Zonni's army, while controlling wealthy Timbucktu will bring great prosperity to Zar-Hay."
SON_city_of_misguided:0 "The City Of Misguided Scholars"
SON_city_of_misguided_desc:0 "The intellectuals and merchants of Timbucktu defied the King of Alwani when he returned from exile, wishing to remain independent. Now they may defy Zar-Hay as well, despite suffering a total military defeat. Tradition dictates that they should recognize their rightful superiors, but they are eager to break sacred traditions. Let them face the consequences."
SON_fate_of_the_king:0 "The Fate Of The King"
SON_fate_of_the_king_desc:0 "As the warriors marched into Alwani, they managed to capture King Euzegoar. The monarch had tried to re-establish his sundered realm, but had met with failure. Now he is disgraced and powerless, yet Zonni must decide if he is worthy to keep his life, or if he should be executed to break the spirit of his supporters."
SON_desert_tribes:0 "Recruit The Desert Warriors"
SON_desert_tribes_desc:0 "King Euzegoar's army was bolstered by savages from the Zubian desert, but Zonni quickly learned to respect their fighting skills. While they were highly loyal to the King, this has changed after his defeat. They could be convinced to fight for a new master and provide their knowledge of warfare to the Zar-Hay army."
SON_governor_of_north:0 "Governor Of The North"
SON_governor_of_north_desc:0 "The lands of the former Kingdom of Alwani are too vast to be directly administered, and it is not possible to simply subjugate local chiefs. Many remain loyal to the former King and Timbucktu has always had its own form of government. Therefore, a new title must be created for the zebra who will govern the north on behalf of the Kingdom of Zar-Hay."
SON_subjugate_south:0 "Subjugate The South"
SON_subjugate_south_desc:0 "In the south lie the heartlands of the Great Lakes, with fertile soil and prosperous cities. Control of the region cannot be secured without first seizing these lands. The Mazwians knew this as it was the first place they conquered. The upcoming war will not be easy, so Zonni must ensure he is well prepared before casting the die."
SON_eternal_no_more:0 "Eternal No More"
SON_eternal_no_more_desc:0 "The Zefuwa dynasty of Gelon-Zornu is respected, to the point where even the Mazwians left them alone. Yet they had no mercy on the other kings of the Great Lakes. The Zefuwa should not expect to get preferential treatment from those who lost their royalty while they fattened themselves on food under Mazwian protection."
SON_the_golden_fields:0 "The Golden Fields"
SON_the_golden_fields_desc:0 "The lands around the lakes are very fertile, producing plentiful amounts of sorghum and millet. Indeed, Ugabi and Aoranda were the breadbasket of the Imperial Mazwi, feeding its thriving cities. The new Zar-Hay dominion will also take advantage of this, but demanding less taxes than the Mazwians did, thus gaining the favour of the locals."

#The sons and daughters of Zargitau

SON_lessons_from_battles:0 "Lessons From Battles"
SON_lessons_from_battles_desc:0 "Zonni Zolon knows that every battle against the enemy is a chance to refine the art of war. Mistakes must be learned from and successes need to be repeated. The enemy's tactics need to be analyzed as well so weaknesses can be found and exploited. Doing all this, the army's military strategies will slowly be honed to perfection."
SON_meritocratic_promotion:0 "Meritocratic Promotion"
SON_meritocratic_promotion_desc:0 "The warriors should be commanded by those who are capable, not those who earned their position through familial connections or tribal allegiances. Zonni seeks to always promote the most distinguished soldiers into higher ranks, so they can use their combat experience to improve the army."
SON_ceaseless_drilling:0 "Ceaseless Drilling"
SON_ceaseless_drilling_desc:0 "Drilling has always been vital to warfare. Moreso in the past, when units fought in formation, but even now in the age of guns drilling can be used to improve the discipline of the army and improving the maneuverability of infantry. Constantly training the soldiers to march orderly and obey commands will enhance their performance."
SON_foreign_military_advisors:0 "Hire Foreign Advisors"
SON_foreign_military_advisors_desc:0 "While some may be sceptical of foreigners and their bizarre ways, there is no doubt that their methods of waging war and making weapons are far more advanced than anything in the Great Lakes. Using loot from conquests to hire experts from abroad would help greatly in modernizing the nation."
SON_formalized_recruitment:0 "Advanced Conscription Methods"
SON_formalized_recruitment_desc:0 "In modern war, every citizen is a soldier. The old methods of tribal levies and voluntary recruitment are simply too inefficient. With the help of foreign advisors, free zebras of the nation will be given basic training and drafted into the reserve pool, ready to replace casualties when needed."
SON_supply_logistic_crap:0 "Supply And Logistics"
SON_supply_logistic_crap_desc:0 "Every good commander knows that it is logistics that decide the outcome of wars. Unfortunately, the foreign advisors have discovered that the supply chains of the Zar-Hay army are archaic at best, incapable of supporting a full-scale modern force. Properly organized and well-planned logistics will help greatly in supplying the warriors."
SON_retrain_royal_guard:0 "Retrain The Royal Retinue"
SON_retrain_royal_guard_desc:0 "The most loyal warriors of the Kingdom serve the throne directly and are among the most capable fighters in all of Zar-Hay. Yet recent battles have proven that their tactics and equipment are outdated. They could be greatly improved with some rigorous training and refinement of strategies."
SON_artillery_experimentation:0 "Experimentation With Artillery"
SON_artillery_experimentation_desc:0 "So far the use of artillery in the army has been limited, but there is no doubt that long-range heavy weaponry has immense potential on the battlefield. New and more modern designs for big guns should be adopted by the gunsmiths so the infantry can have proper fire support."
SON_royal_gun_workshop:0 "Royal Cannon Workshop"
SON_royal_gun_workshop_desc:0 "While the gunsmith guilds work hard to supply the army, it is not enough. Zonni Zolon has decreed that a workshop dedicated to producing weaponry needs to be established in Zao. Unlike a traditional guild, it will employ unskilled workers to boost production rates, at expense of quality."
SON_meet_with_sorcerer:0 "Meet With The Sorcerer"
SON_meet_with_sorcerer_desc:0 "The enigmatic Chief of the Zarabara tribe, Faran, has so far shown only token support for Zonni's cause. Because he is a renowned sorcerer, his abilities could be of great use to the Kingdom. A meeting must be arranged so his aid can be secured."
SON_anti_resistance_crap:0 "Crush Resistance Movements"
SON_anti_resistance_crap_desc:0 "The defeated must learn to accept defeat instead of continuing to foolishly resist their new masters. Zonni will authorize his warriors to conduct brutal reprisals on anyone who opposes the new Zar-Hay hegemony over the Great Lakes. Under Mazwian rule, the Zar-Hay suffered greatly; now others must experience the same."

### Decisions ###

SON_reemite_support_decisions_category:0 "Re'emite Support"
SON_reemite_support_decisions_category_desc:0 "Zonni Zolon has proclaimed himself to be the protector of Re'em and expects something in return from the Re'emites. However, they are only willing to aid him if they support his cause. Thus, Zonni needs to do what he can to appease them and avoid actions that may upset them.\n\nCurrently, Re'emite support is [Root.SON_reemite_support_dynamic_loc].\n\nSecuring control of §gRe'emite enclave§! states and militarily aiding Re'em will increase support, while committing §Rimmoral acts§! will decrease support."
SON_support_reem:0 "Send Warriors To Re'em"
SON_support_reem_desc:0 "Re'em is a small country and could always benefit from having more soldiers in its army. They have the guns, so we can provide the warriors.

SON_literacy_program:0 "Re'emite Literacy Program"
SON_literacy_program_desc:0 "The Re'emites are literate folk, with the secrets of reading being widely known in their nation. We can request them to launch literacy programs in Zar-Hay to share their secrets with our subjects. A literate populace is a more capable and productive populace, after all."
SON_improve_society:0 "Re'emite Development Aid"
SON_improve_society_desc:0 "Zar-Hay was once a prosperous nation, but decades of Mazwian occupation have drained the nation's wealth, and the Storm King only made things worse. Now our nation is backwards, but with the help of the Re'emites, Zar-Hay society may develop and slowly begin to industrialize."
SON_alleviate_poverty:0 "Re'emite Poverty Relief"
SON_alleviate_poverty_desc:0 "Many free farmers and artisans have been struggling to make ends meet due to economic instability in the Great Lakes. While our economy recovers, the Re'emites can provide emergency aid to those in need, hopefully enough so they can get back on their hooves."
SON_recover_from_storm:0 "Re'emite Reconstruction Committee"
SON_recover_from_storm_desc:0 "The Storm King ravaged half of Zebrica, including Zar-Hay and Re'em. While both countries suffered, Re'em can more quickly recover with their more developed nation. Zar-Hay, however, could benefit greatly from their help. While lost artifacts may never be recovered, what was destroyed can now be rebuilt."

### Events ###

zarhay.1.t:0 "The Chiefs Arrive"
zarhay.1.d:0 "Chief Quaggo arrived at the capital of Zao accompanied by his retinue of advisors and servants. He comfortably lied on his palanquin as his slaves carried it through the busy streets of the capital. He was not the only chief in town, clearly, as he saw many other chiefs and their entourages on his way to the Royal Palace.\n\nAfter they arrived, Quaggo got down from his seat and ordered his servants to do what he had told them to do earlier. The courtyard of the palace, located on the shore of Lake Zao, was filled with the many chiefs of Zar-Hay who were all chattering with one another. Soon enough, Quaggo himself would chatter as he saw his good friend, Chieftess Amzina. They exchanged formal pleasantries before engaging in more serious discussion.\n"What do you think the Regent is up to?" Quaggo asked from the mare adorned in gold.\n"He'll gather us in a room so he can kill us all at once, then seize total control," Amzina said with a smirk.\nQuaggo narrowed his eyes. "Very funny. I wanted to have a serious talk with you."\n"Fine then. To be honest, I'm not sure what to expect. One way or another, he will want to secure his rule."\n"I suppose we shall see. Earlier, I told my servants to do some investigating, just in case Zonni is plotting something God-forsaken."\n"You're being paranoid, silly. As always."\n"How can we trust him? He is half-Mazwian."\nAmzina rolled her eyes. "Let's just go to the meeting and see what happens, alright?""
zarhay.1.a:0 "Wonder what he's up to?"

zarhay.2.t:0 "Zonni's Dream"
zarhay.2.d:0 "A royal slave came out of the palace, beating a djembe drum with his hoof. The chiefs in the courtyard went silent and turned to look. Then Zonni appeared, eyeing at the crowd of chiefs closely, as if he was trying to read their thoughts, and walked up to a raised dais in front of the palace. There was a golden seat on it, but only Kings and Queens could sit there, so Zonni simply stood alongside it. He then addressed the gathered aristocrats.\n\n"Esteemed chiefs of Zar-Hay! I have summoned you here for a good reason. I have a dream, and to fulfill it, I need your unquestionable loyalty. It is not just any dream, but a dream of making Zar-Hay a truly mighty Kingdom! Long have we been subjugated, treated like slaves no matter what caste we belonged to, extorted and robbed by foreigners. We have lost our glory, our wealth and even our royalty. All this is disheartening, but I refuse to be disheartened! We should not simply sit idly as a golden opportunity presents itself. The Sky Stallion has paved the way to redeem ourselves; all we must do is walk down this sacred path. That is what I intend to do.\n\nThe Mazwian Empire has collapsed. The Storm King is no more. Now there is a power vacuum in the Great Lakes, which lies fractured and weak. Now is our chance to strike with our warriors, to forge a mighty empire surpassing Mazwi in its glory. This way, the Zar-Hay will no longer be slaves, but masters forever!"\n\nThe chiefs looked at each other quietly. Then, one of them began stomping the ground with their hooves. This began to spread as more and more chiefs showed their support for Zonni and his dream. In the end, even sceptics like Quaggo couldn't help but follow the herd and do the same.\n\nWhen Zonni saw this, he grinned. Finally, the chiefs were on his side."
zarhay.2.a:0 "We shall become great!"

zarhay.3.t:0 "A Wandering Warrior"
zarhay.3.d:0 "It seemed word of Zonni's ambitions had spread quickly, because a warrior claiming to come from a distant land requested audience with the Regent. Zonni, always in need of capable soldiers, agreed to meet him.\n\nThe warrior introduced himself as Ture Sylla and said he had fought under many rulers over the years in return for pay. Now he offered his experience and skill to Zonni, because he believed he would be victorious in the coming wars of unification, and wanted to be on the winning side.\n\nZonni was very tempted by this offer, but he wondered what the chiefs would think if he allowed a foreigner to lead their troops into battle? Perhaps it wasn't worthwhile, as he didn't want to lose their trust. Then again, a competent leader like Ture Sylla was just what he needed to aid him in his conquests."
zarhay.3.a:0 "He will be useful to us."
zarhay.3.b:0 "We have no need for him."

zarhay.4.t:0 "Ancestral Shame"
zarhay.4.d:0 "The speech had been successful and Zonni had gained the loyalty of the chiefs. As long as he would lead the army into battle to subjugate Zar-Hay's neighbours, the chiefs were willing to support him.\n\nAfter the feast following the meeting, Zonni left the city proper and travelled alone to a large field. There were many grassy mounds there, where the Kings and Queens and mighty chiefs lied entombed forever. He walked past them, to the burial ground of lesser chiefs, to the grave of his late father.\n\nHe sat on the ground and mumbled a quiet prayer to his ancestors, then began to speak to his father.\n"It appears as if I have finally gained their trust, father. But I know I have not. They are merely giving me another chance to prove that I truly am a Zar-Hay. But it is ridiculous, is it not? I had to promise so much to gain so little. And even if I succeed, will they accept me? Or will they still reject me, refusing to trust me because of my mother?"\nHe let out a deep sigh. "Sometimes I wonder why you married a Mazwian mare. It has brought our family nothing but shame and trouble. Perhaps it was just blind, foolish love. Or a gamble, which would've paid off had the Mazwian Empire not utterly collapsed. Either way, I do not judge you, father. I just wish I knew why, that is all."\nThere was a gust of wind. His father was answering, but he wasn't sure he understood. Perhaps his father was ashamed to tell the full truth?\n"I apologize for my curiosity. Don't feel pressured to answer. I will still love you, father, no matter what happens. And I promise to you, I will restore our family's lost honour. I will bring judgement upon our enemies. Our family won't have petty chiefs anymore but... an Emperor."\nWind howled in the darkness as the sun set. Zonni took this as a warning. "I will be careful, don't worry. I am no weakling anymore. Once I have gained total victory, I will return. I promise."\nHe humbly prostrated himself before the grave, and the wind calmed, becoming a pleasant breeze."
zarhay.4.a:0 "Once I come back, I will be a true Zar-Hay."

zarhay.5.t:0 "The Praise-Singers"
zarhay.5.d:0 "Fassa Balleke was a famed griot, whose ancestors had been in the court of the Zar-Hay monarch. But ever since the Mazwian invasion, they had lived in exile, wandering the land and entertaining countless chiefs and petty kings. When the Regent of Zar-Hay offered her a position in his court, she was at first sceptical, as griots traditionally served rulers, not mere regents. But in these tumultuous times, she couldn't simply refuse a job offer like that.\n\nWhen she arrived at the Royal Palace, she quickly realized she wasn't the only griot who had been invited there. Some of the griots she recognized, yet others appeared obscure and unpopular. The Regent had cast a very wide net in his search for griots.\n\nThen Zonni came out to meet them. "Greetings, honoured griots, and welcome to the Royal Palace! These walls have not heard your music or song in so many years, yet this shall now change. I know some of you may be wondering why a mere Regent would have a need for you. No, I do not intend to become King. However, I do need your aid. You see, I need popular support for my grand unification campaigns which I have planned. I need talented speakers and entertainers like you to spread the word among the commoners, glorifying my rule, drumming up support for my cause and recording my deeds for the future generations. In return, I will offer you a generous share of the spoils of war. I swear on the Spirits that you will become rich."\n\nTo some it might have seemed like an unpleasant job, but for Fassa it was nothing out of the ordinary. Such was the usual duty of the griot caste. However, in her heart she feared that the Regent's gamble would fail, that he would be defeated and his griots enslaved. But as she looked around the Palace, she felt like she was finally back home. She prayed to God, and stepped forth to accept Zonni as her new patron."

zarhay.6.t:0 "The Wind-Singers"
zarhay.6.d:0 "Zonni uncovered his head as he entered a hallowed sanctuary of the Wind-Singers. The white-robed priests inside nodded in greeting. "We have expected you, scion of Zolon," the eldest of the priests said.\nZonni raised an eyebrow. "How? I did not inform you of my arrival."\n"The Spirits told us. They also said you've come to see the future."\n"Yes. If the Spirits told you that, then clearly I can trust you to conduct a divination and reveal my fate to me."\nOne of the other priests shook her head. "Fate is fickle. Visions are unclear. Future is always in flux."\n"The further away we look, the harder it becomes to see," the eldest priest added. "But perhaps the Spirits are in a generous mood today."\n"I pray it is so," Zonni replied. "Please, tell me if my dream is doomed to fail, if I should bother waging war in the first place. That is all I wish to know."\nThe priests looked at one another, then nodded. "Then come, to conduct a proper divination we must do so in the open," the eldest said.\n\nThe zebras left the sanctuary and walked to a nearby open field. They spread out a pure white cloth with painted markings and symbols on the grass. One of the priests had brought with him a pouch, which he gave to the eldest Wind-Singer. The priests stood and waited for the wind to pick up, and when there was a gust of wind, the priests hummed and the eldest one threw out the contents of the pouch into the wind. Bone fragments, gemstones, amulets and carved dice were scattered by the wind onto the cloth. As the wind died down, so did the humming of the priests. The eldest one then sat down in front of the cloth and began to study the pattern created by the objects.\n"What do you see, elder?" Zonni asked, curious and eager.\nThe eldest furrowed his brow. "I see... a dead lion," he said and pointed at several items on the cloth. "And a white-backed vulture, swooping in to feast on its flesh."\nZonni's eyes widened. "I see what this means. The lion is Mazwi and I am the vulture!"\nThe eldest narrowed his eyes. "But then a hidden hunter appears from the bush and scares the vulture away, claiming the lion's remains."\nZonni frowned. "Hrm. Sounds like I need to be careful, or I will lose it all."\n"You are interpreting the signs well enough," the eldest said. "But remember what was said. The future is not set in stone. The vulture may yet feast on the lion."\nZonni nodded, and smiled confidently."
zarhay.6.a:0 "It is a good sign, thank God."

zarhay.7.t:0 "New Tools Of Death"
zarhay.7.d:0 "Gunsmiths were among the most respected members of the artisan caste, capable of assembling intricate weaponry from metal. Before, they had made fine swords of steel, but in recent decades they had learned to make muskets instead. In this time of rapid change, they would have to adapt yet again.\n\nZonni entered the courtyard of the gunsmith's workshop, where the local guild masters and their students were already waiting. On his back, Zonni carried a weapon which immediately attracted the attention of the smiths. He stopped in front of the audience members, who bowed in respect, and took out the gun. "Greetings, esteemed gunsmiths. Do any of you know what this is?"\nThe gunsmiths looked at each other in doubt. "Is it some kind of musket?" one of them asked.\nZonni chuckled. "Almost correct. This, my friends, is a rifle. Allow me to demonstrate how it works." He motioned to his servants who brought out a blindfolded female prisoner into the courtyard, guiding it to stand in front of a mudbrick wall. It was a slave who had tried to kill its owner and had thus been condemned to death.\n\nZonni stood up on his hind legs, loaded the rifle, took aim and fired. A loud bang echoed in the courtyard as the slave dropped dead in an instant. The gunsmiths looked in awe, their mouths wide open. Zonni smiled as he turned to face them again. "As you can see, it is far more accurate than a musket and produces less smoke. I have spent a fortune acquiring these from a dealer in Tobuck. Your task will be to dismantle and study this weapon, so we may learn to make it ourselves. I trust you will do a fine job in service to the Kingdom, and receive a handsome reward in return." Zonni gave the rifle to the nearest gunsmith, who prostrated herself on the ground, deeply grateful."

zarhay.8.d:0 "In a strange turn of events, Zonni Zolon, the Crown Regent of the Kingdom of Zar-Hay, has sworn to protect Re'emites from any outside aggression. This pledge of protection extends to any Re'emite minorities living within territory under Zar-Hay control.\n\nHowever, he was quick to make it clear that he is not doing this out of the goodness of his heart, and said Re'em would have to provide his nation aid in return. This help did not have to be military in nature, as Re'em could help develop the underdeveloped country in return and work to eliminate poverty. [Root.GetLeader] has accepted this, as Re'em has already done much to aid the zebras of the Great Lakes. Besides, if Zonni grows stronger, he will be a powerful ally for Re'em, ensuring its survival in the future."
zarhay.8.a:0 "Thank you..?"

zarhay.9.t:0 "A Worthy Sacrifice"
zarhay.9.d:0 "Zonni had ordered a sacrificial ceremony to be held by the priesthood of Zao in preparation for the wars he was about to wage. The Wind-Singers got to work and Zonni assumed he did not need to get involved himself. However, one of the priests approached him and requested him to decide what would be sacrificed. Traditionally, it had been the decision of the Kings and Queens, but as Zonni was the royal regent, the responsibility was now on his shoulders.\n\nZonni pondered deeply, for the decision was vital. If the right sacrifice was not made, the spirits would be displeased and cast a curse on him. On the other hoof, if he chose correctly, then the spirits would bless his ambitions and further ensure he'd prevail on the battlefield. The most important spirits to appease were Zabera, grandfather of war, Muawri, god of the hunt, and Zargitau, the founder of Zao and the progenitor of Zar-Hay. The custom offering consisted of fresh kola nuts, divided into four lobes. Zabera was known to be especially fond of the bittersweet seeds. But Zonni was unsure if this was a fitting sacrifice, as the coming wars weren't a mere skirmish or raid, and possibly required a greater sacrifice. Dogs were favourite animals of Zargitau and close companions of Muawri, so they'd be pleased by such a offering. Yet even this did not feel like enough. Perhaps a grand sacrifice was in place, to truly impress the spirits and show them that Zonni was in great need of their blessing? For that, 444 slaves would suffice. It was a sacred number and ritual killings of slaves were acceptable in Zar-Hay society. But perhaps it was too much...\n\nEventually, Zonni finally made the decision and revealed it to the Wind-Singers."
zarhay.9.a:0 "Offer kola nuts."

zarhay.10.t:0 "Gathering The Warriors"
zarhay.10.d:0 "As far as Zonni was concerned, every capable zebra in the Kingdom was a potential soldier. As the clouds of war were gathering, so too would the levied troops of Zar-Hay. They would provide crucial support for the more professional royal retinue and the chieftains' personal armies. Zonni had done much work in preparation to organize the mustering of soldiers, hiring administrators, establishing a regional command hierarchy and bribing the right zebras to ensure it would go smoothly. He was not inventing everything new, of course, just renovating the old levy system of the Kingdom that had not been used since before the Mazwians had ended their independence centuries ago.\n\nSoon, the war drums were beaten across the nation and zebras were called to arms. Many began gathering in the centers of their towns and villages where Zonni's commanders were overseeing the mustering. Each zebra brought their own equipment and rations, many armed with crude muskets, swords, spears or bows. Units were formed and the conscripts were assigned officers from the ranks of the aristocracy. Then these units would march to Zao, where the levies would swear allegiance to the Regent.\n\nZonni was proud to see thousands of soldiers gathering in the capital. The mustering had gone well, and while many villages had now lost able-bodied workers, they'd be back home eventually. Dead or alive. What mattered to Zonni was that his army was now strong enough to face the challenges ahead of them."

zarhay.11.t:0 "Righteous Flames"
zarhay.11.d:0 "The false prophet was escorted to a stake by Zonni's warriors. He was tied up to the wooden pole, next to his most dedicated followers who would share his fate. Unlike them, however, the prophet did not seem afraid. His face was emotionless, his eyes determined. This stallion was not afraid of death, it seemed.\n\nZonni approached him, looking at the fanatic with disdain. "Speak if you will, for soon you will no longer be able to do so."\n"I have nothing to say to you; but I ask God to forgive you for your sins, for you are misguided."\n"Misguided? You are the one who is misguided! You wished to force the zebras of the Great Lakes to all follow your ways of worship, regardless of their own traditions."\nThe prophet ignored him as he closed his eyes. "I have nothing to fear. The flames cannot hurt me. I am with God, and God is with me."\nThe Regent grimaced, almost in disgust. "If God was with you, then why did you lose?"\n\nHe received no response as the prophet continued to mumble his prayers. Zonni rolled his eyes and turned to his warriors, who were holding lit torches. "The time has come! Let us get rid of these lost souls. They are beyond redemption."\n\nThe soldiers nodded and ignited the piles of dry branches at the base of each stake. The fires spread quickly, engulfing the prophet and his followers. One by one, they each began screaming from pain, except for the prophet who was completely silent even as his coat began burning. But in the end, he too screamed and begged for Zonni's forgiveness. The Regent simply glared back. Now he was the one who refused to respond."

zarhay.12.t:0 "A Meeting In Zarabara"
zarhay.12.d:0 "As Zonni Zolon entered the dwelling of the chieftain, he was immediately met with pungent fumes that filled the air. One of Faran's servants advised him to cover his muzzle while he was inside, as the Chief had recently been brewing potions. The Regent did so and followed the servant as she guided him to the meeting chamber.\n\nThere, Faran was already waiting, seated on a cushion with a stoic face. Zonni sat down in front of him and the Chief offered him kola nuts, a traditional gift of hospitality. The Regent humbly accepted.\n"You know why I come here, so let us bypass the formalities. How can I convince you to provide your skills of sorcery in service to the Kingdom?"\nFaran said nothing, simply glaring at him. Zonni frowned and almost took it as an insult, before Faran suddenly burst into laughter. "He who asks, shall receive!"\nZonni blinked in confusion, then regained his composure. "Well, that is what I am doing now."\n"But what do you ask for? I have many skills that can be used in many ways. Are you in need of my potions, or my knowledge of the arcane?"\nZonni raised an eyebrow. "Can you not provide both?"\n"Do not be greedy, despite your status. You may ask for one thing, and you shall receive it. What will it be?" Faran grinned.\n\nThe Regent pondered for a while before answering. Faran's potions would be greatly useful, empowering the warriors of the army, but his abilities as a sorcerer could be used to empower the state. Part of him wanted to simply demand both, but even he did not dare to arouse the wrath of a zebra who could cast a curse to break his back."

zarhay.13.t:0 "The Price Of Arrogance"
zarhay.13.d:0 "Soon after Zonni Zolon had marched into Timbucktu as a victor, the university of Timbucktu launched a smear campaign against him, likely funded by the city's merchants. Pamphlets were spread among the literate populace, exposing Zonni Zolon as an illiterate, half-Mazwian tyrant, claiming he also dabbled in forbidden sorcery.\n\nWhen Zonni heard of this, his blood begun to boil. While the claim about him beign a sorcerer was a lie, everything else was truth. The foolish scholars used the truth as a weapon, striking him where it hurt. As a result of the campaign, the populace of Timbucktu were encouraged to resist the foreign occupier and threaten the newly established peace in the region.\n\nZonni would not stand for this. No one could mock him without facing the consequences. In his fury, he ordered the teachers and professors of the university to be rounded up and imprisoned for inciting a revolt against him. The most prominent scholars would be tortured or executed, while the university's printing presses were to be shattered with hammers and the city's libraries burned with fire. The wealth of the merchants would be confiscated so they would become beggars, unable to fund any resistance. Zonni's faithful warriors obeyed and carried out his commands. A dark pillar of smoke soon rose from the heart of Timbucktu.\n\nIf they wanted him to be a monster, then he'd become one."

zarhay.14.t:0 "The Purpose Of Oppression"
zarhay.14.d:0 "Chieftess Meynsata of the Zibiridugu tribe was above all a warrior, but even she had a code of honour. Therefore she treated prisoners of war well and was merciful upon the defeated. When Zonni Zolon launched his reprisals against the zebras of Timbucktu, Meynsata couldn't help but question his actions. Zonni was fond of her, so she was not afraid of potentially angering him.\n\nWhen Meynsata met with him and asked why he was so ruthless against the Timbucktuans, Zonni sighed and said he'd tell a story from his youth.\n"When I was a mere colt, I was weak and pathetic. Other foals saw my weakness and thus abused me, making fun of my mixed blood and trampling me with their hooves. When I told my parents about this, my Mazwian mother said that I should turn the other cheek so the Sky Stallion would see my moral superiority. Of course, that did nothing. When I returned with a bloodied muzzle, my Zar-Hay father told me to strike back with twice the fury. Even if I was weak, it did not matter. I had to show them that mistreating me would have consequences.\nSo I faced the bullies again, but when they mocked me I mocked them back, calling them sons and daughters of donkeys. They beat me, and I struck back. While I was weak, they saw I was no longer a pushover. Their bullying continued for a while until they realized that it wasn't worth it. Slowly, they even began to fear and respect me. No one has dared to bully me ever since.\nThis is why I strike back with twice the fury at anyone who mocks me or conspires against me. The bullies learned this, and now the Timbucktuans did, too."\n\nMeynsata nodded. While she still did not agree with his actions, she did understand the reasoning."

zarhay.15.t:0 "The King Of The North"
zarhay.15.d:0 "Zonni was in Zongola, seated on the throne of the King of Alwani. He looked down upon Euzegoar as he was brought before him in chains. The zebra's spirit was broken, yet Zonni could sense a tiny flame of defiance as Euzegoar glared at him. The Regent stood up.\n"Your majesty, it is unfortunate that I cannot let you go free, as your supporters are... hesitant to accept defeat. Therefore I have to deal with you to dissuade their resistance."\n"Such audacity," Euzegoar spat out. "First you subjugate my subjects, then you plan to commit regicide to secure your unjust rule?"\n"My rule is just, as I have secured it with the strength of my army. Mighty empires are forged with violence and their right to rule comes from victory. As for 'regicide', well, that would require you to still be a King, wouldn't it?"\nEuzegoar's face twisted in hatred. "Truly, you have Mazwian blood in your veins, as you are bent oppression and subjugation. Fine then, deal with me as you see fit. The Storm King would be proud of your lack of mercy."\nZonni narrowed his eyes. He felt an urge to behead him immediately with his sword, but at the same time he questioned if that was the right thing to do. Killing Euzegoar would create a martyr and possibly incite further resistance. Taking him as a hostage would just make him seem even more like a Mazwian, but what about being merciful? He could spare him on the condition that he would order his supporters to lay down their arms, and could further appease him by making him governor of the north. However, Zonni was unsure if he could truly trust Euzegoar. Perhaps it'd be best to simply kill him and be done with it."

zarhay.16.d_no_euzegoar:0 "The domain of Zar-Hay had expanded quickly. Some said too quickly. Yet Zonni cared little for the naysayers and knew that he had to establish effective governance of conquered lands to secure control over them. The annexation of Macigena had already brought dozens of additional chieftains into the ranks of the nation's aristocracy, and doing the same to the entire north would result in a decentralized administrative nightmare. No, instead, Zonni knew he'd unfortunately have to do what the Mazwians had done and assign a regional governor to manage local administration.\n\nWhile the officials did the necessary paperwork, Zonni had to decide who should receive this responsibility. It should be somezebra he could trust, who wouldn't revolt at the first sign of his weakness, but also a zebra who was competent enough to handle the management of such a large area. This narrowed down the list of potential candidates greatly, as Zonni did not trust many zebras.\n\nIn the end, he seriously considered only two possible candidates: One was Zogon, the drillmaster of the army and a former master of slaves, while the other was Chieftess Amzina, known for making her tribe prosper. Zogon was loyal beyond any doubt, but wasn't as competent of a manager as Amzina would be. Meanwhile Amzina's power and influence was already great, so empowering her even more was potentially a bad idea.\n\nAfter a while, Zonni made the final decision and hoped he would not regret it."

When Mazwi was weak, they had simply seized the opportunity to declare independence, so clearly they could not be trusted. Yet as the word spread, zebras in Zao began to talk how Zonni was now acting like a Mazwian, taking subjugated rulers hostage, drawing comparisons to what had happened to Zar-Hay's royal family. This made Zonni's blood boil as despite refusing to leave the Zefuwa alone, he was still being compared to the Mazwians. It's like the zebras refused to forget his heritage.\n\nIn a fit of anger, he changed his plans to a more brutal direction, to prove that he would not mimic the accursed Mazwians in any way. He would extinguish the Zefuwa dynasty, thus removing any threat of disloyalty from Gelon-Zornu. Yet he felt pity on the former Mai, Gounama, who was an old zebra. Therefore he decided to leave him alone, and instead get rid of his heirs, so when he'd die of age, no one would inherit his claims to the throne.\n\nAll of his sons, daughters, cousins and other close relatives were rounded up in a countrywide search. They were then brought to Zao, where Zonni ordered the preparation of a sacrificial ritual. He claimed the gods would be pleased with an offering of royal blood, though the Wind-Singers were sceptical. Nevertheless, they obeyed, and soon enough a grand ritual was held where every heir of the Zefuwa dynasty was sacrificed to the Spirits.\n\nIt was said Gounama mourned for seven days before passing away, his heart broken from shock and despair."
