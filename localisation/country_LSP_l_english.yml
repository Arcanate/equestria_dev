 LSP_fragile_food_supply_desc:0 "Las Pegasus is a large, thriving city - which relied upon imports from the rest of Equestria to ensure it could meet its food requirements. We have substantial stockpiles, but if we don't find some solution within a few months, famine could be on the horizon..."
 LSP_famine:0 "Famine"
 LSP_fragile_food_supply_desc:0 "Our food supply has broken down, and can no longer properly feed everypony within our borders. Thousands are suffering from malnutrition, and many have to make do with only one meal a day.

 LSP_chaotic_politics_desc:0 "Las Pegasus was not prepared for independence, and now nopony is quite sure who they should listen to or who should be in charge. Harmonists agitate for re-annexation into Equestria, while the Trade Unions go on strike and the Army remains on high alert. The Mayor's authority is recognised by very few. Celestia save us..."
 LSP_chaotic_politics_mayor1:0 "Political Chaos" 
 LSP_chaotic_politics_mayor1_desc:0 "Though there are still occasional protests, and though traitors still scheme in darkened rooms, Las Pegasus has returned to a semblance of normalcy.

 LSP_chaotic_politics_reds1_desc:0 "Starry Plough and the forces of the CLA have managed to destroy all of their internal enemies, preventing the Revolution from being smothered in its crib.

 LSP_chaotic_army:0 "Shambolic Military"
 LSP_chaotic_army_desc:0 "Much of Las Pegasus' armed forces were loyal to Celestia, and were thus expelled from the new state by loyalist forces upon the declaration of independence. Our army is currently comprised of a rough admixture of National Guard units, members of the Socialist Citizen Liberation Army, and paramilitary units from "General" Pine Chest's fanatically anticommunist and paranoid Patriotic Citizen Army. Predictably, these armies do not function very well as a cohesive unit."
 LSP_chaotic_army_mayor1:0 "Shambolic Military"
 LSP_chaotic_army_mayor1_desc:0 "The Mayor has set up a new chain of command to integrate the PCA and CLA into the National Guard. This will be a very difficult process, but it is absolutely necessary if we are to have a functioning army."

 LSP_chaotic_army_reds1:0 "Shambolic Military"
 LSP_chaotic_army_reds1_desc:0 "The reactionary elements have been purged from our army, Comrades! Rejoice! However, our CLA is still very new and inexperienced. We will have our work cut out for us if we want to make this into a worthy fighting force."
