 NCH_trading_with_the_Continentals_desc:0 "Now that we have established our place in the continent, it is time for us to build upon it. With this small step, the hope is for all of the continent to become used to our kind. Perhaps, we may even convince the whole world..."

 NCH_literacy_volunteer_brigades:0 "Literacy Volunteer Brigades"
 NCH_literacy_volunteer_brigades_desc:0 "The Changelings of Greneclyf have long been illiterate, to the point that it has directly hampered our societal development. Recruiting literate volunteers to teach others will be the best way to overcome this challenge."

 NCH_invite_cader_sclerite_desc:0 "Cader Sclerite has long been a proponent of a foreign philosophy from abroad. In the past he had been sidelined for the Queen's more popular ideals, but now the idea of worker equality might just be what we need."
 NCH_find_a_compromise_desc:0 "Sclerite is willing to do his part to better Greneclyf, but he has no interest in taking charge. Queen Gytha will remain in power, though Sclerite will be by her side from now on."
 NCH_remove_the_queen_desc:0 "We'd rather be damned than wait for the Queen to gain back her senses. Despite what he otherwise says, Sclerite is our best chance to get out of this mess."

 NCH_unionisation_desc:0 "Long discussions between Gytha and Sclerite have yielded results. Sclerite's more extreme policies have been tempered to allow some worker rights and the existence of semi-private companies. "
 NCH_collectivisation_desc:0 "With Gytha gone, Sclerite is free to apply his policies to their full extent. Revoking the rights of private workers may seem cruel, but it is a necessary step to rapidly increase production."
 NCH_centralisation_desc:0 "Greneclyf has been a series of small hives under one Queen since time immemorial. This inefficiency must be addressed with a swift centralisation of power under one group rather than several."
 NCH_the_four_year_plan_desc:0 "Now that our workers are united and power is centered around the government, Sclerite has unveiled a number of economic and industrial goals to be achieved over the course of three years. This will call for brutal efficiency and modernisation, and plenty of sweat and tears from our people."
 NCH_establish_the_cis:0 "Establish the CIS"
 NCH_establish_the_cis_desc:0 "Our efforts of modernisation and industrialisation will undoubtedly draw out many dissenters from within and enemies from abroad. A new governmental organ, the Comissariat of Internal Security, will protect us from all political threats."

 NCH_infiltrate_the_federation:0 "Infiltrate the Federation"
 NCH_formalize_a_general_staff_desc:0 "Our isolation and traditions have limited our military progress, and it is evident in our lack of a dedicated officer staff. Going off from what we've observed, we can correct this deficiency."
 NCH_restructure_the_military_desc:0 "With a new and modern general staff, we can apply the new reforms down the chain of command, right down to the frontline soldier."

 NCH_form_an_intelligence_network_desc:0 "Preliminary analyses by the CIS indicate that while our defenses are stout, we lack any meaningful offensive capacity. The CIS can apply external pressure abroad if we give them the resources to do so."
 NCH_the_modern_changeling_desc:0 "We can see how far we've come as a people in the last years, and we've become something different. We are neither antagonistic nor amicable: we are the modern pragmatists. We are the Modern Changelings."
 NCH_a_true_communist_state_desc:0 "Greneclyf has sustained so many hardships to finally reach this point. Our island state is no longer an isolated backwater but a modern state. We have made our introduction to the world, and it shall no longer mock us."

 NCH_perpetual_revolution_desc:0 "We have seen the outside world. There are too many enemies to the our way of life, even among those who fancy themselves as communists. We can only safeguard ourselves by taking the initiative."
 NCH_plan_white_desc:0 "Any future expansion to the continent will require a staging area. Farbrook, the land of backstabbers, will serve well as such."
 NCH_oversee_farbrook_desc:0 "Even with though the rightful government has taken power, Farbrook is in shambles. We will step in and take over in our ally's name."
 NCH_bound_by_harmony_desc:0 "Surprisingly enough, our foreign kin are harmonic! Early reports about them were clearly wrong, and they, like us, are united by Harmony."
 NCH_exchange_of_citizens_desc:0 "Despite being bound by race, the Free Hives over the ocean are significantly different from us. Our two people have much to teach one another, and we need only allow them to do so."
 NCH_stand_with_our_kin_desc:0 "The world is a dangerous place, and though both Greneclyf and the Free Hives seek peace, we understand that we must stand together in face of the oncoming storm."
 NCH_beacon_of_harmony_desc:0 "We have severely underestimated our capacity to resist the Hives' influence over us. It is only a matter of time that they will try to break us, so let us show them that we won't be cowed!"
 NCH_approach_equestria_desc:0 "Equestria is an example to Harmonic people everywhere. Surely they will agree to our offer to join their effort in making the world a better and safer place."
 NCH_adapt_the_foreign_way_desc:0 "The Hives under Gold Muffin are alien, but oddly compelling. There is a certain pragmatism to their ways that can explain their success. Perhaps we could adapt them to our society?"
 NCH_transfer_societal_experts_desc:0 "The UCH have much more to teach us beyond their technical expertise. An exchange of their brightest societal minds will lead to a better understanding of the world around us."

 NCH_infiltrate_the_federation_desc:0 "The River Federation is a behemoth, and there will be no chance for us to directly exert our influence upon them. Instead, a more subtle approach will be necessary to take the Federation down."
 NCH_look_beyond_desc:0 "In spite of our previous successes, we are still surrounded by potential enemies. From now on, Greneclyf must always have a plan."
 CHN_equestrian_experts_desc:0 "We request technical experts from the Equestrian Principality, as they have advanced much in their recent history. Being united in Harmony, we can expect them to be excellent teachers."
 NCH_establish_a_diplomatic_corps_desc:0 "Greneclyf has been isolated for far too long. In order for us to truly enter the world stage we must have the actors for it, and only an official diplomatic corps will produce them."
 NCH_set_up_an_academic_exchange_desc:0 "We may be benefitting from Equestrian Expertise on a state level, but not on a societal level. Plans have been made to set up a meeting of the academic minds between our two nations in order to correct this."
