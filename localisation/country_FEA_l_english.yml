### Ideas ###
FEA_crashed_economy:0 "Ruined Economy"
FEA_crashed_economy_desc:0 "Feathisia has always been one of the richest constituent states of the Griffonian Empire, with flourishing trade and adventurous explorers bringing the Duchy great wealth. The nigh constant warfare across the continent that followed the crumbling of the Griffonian Empire had pushed the economy to the brink. Now Skyfall, Feathisia's greatest trading partner, has fallen into chaos, with the bankruptcy of the firms that traded with the Trade Federation causing a ripple effect through the economy. Dealing with the economy should be the first priority of the Feathisian government."
FEA_beloved_monarch:0 "Duke Gerlach the Silent"
FEA_beloved_monarch_desc:0 "Grand Duke Gerlach IV Weijermars is known far and wide as one of the most reasonable leaders in Griffonia. The Duke, who earned his nickname ‘The Silent’ for his patience and calm, transformed his fief into the very first proper Constitutional Monarchy in Griffonia. The people of Feathisia love their Grand Duke and as long as he keeps listening to the concerns of his Griffons, this is unlikely to change."
FEA_danger_in_the_coalition:0 "Crisis in the Coalition"
FEA_danger_in_the_coalition_desc:0 "The recent economic troubles plaguing Feathisia have lead to a divide between the ruling FHP-LDP Coalition, and allowed for more extreme parties to gain prominence within the Parliament. If the issues within the Coalition are not addressed properly it could lead to a general collapse of the Government."
FEA_gov_inter:0 "Ruined Economy"
FEA_gov_inter_desc:0 "Feathisia has always been one of the richest constituent states of the Griffonian Empire, with flourishing trade and adventurous explorers bringing the Duchy great wealth. The nigh constant warfare across the continent that followed the crumbling of the Griffonian Empire had pushed the economy to the brink. Now Skyfall, Feathisia's greatest trading partner, has fallen into chaos, with the bankruptcy of the firms that traded with the Trade Federation causing a ripple effect through the economy. Dealing with the economy should be the first priority of the Feathisian government."
FEA_free_mark:0 "Ruined Economy"
FEA_free_mark_desc:0 "Feathisia has always been one of the richest constituent states of the Griffonian Empire, with flourishing trade and adventurous explorers bringing the Duchy great wealth. The nigh constant warfare across the continent that followed the crumbling of the Griffonian Empire had pushed the economy to the brink. Now Skyfall, Feathisia's greatest trading partner, has fallen into chaos, with the bankruptcy of the firms that traded with the Trade Federation causing a ripple effect through the economy. Dealing with the economy should be the first priority of the Feathisian government."
FEA_sluggish_economy:0 "Sluggish Economy"
FEA_sluggish_economy_desc:0 "While our economic reforms have managed to find quite a bit of success Feathisia's economy is still yet to fully recover. While the worst is now over, we still need to pull through and finish our reforms, if we want to get back to pre-crisis growth levels. The worst is over and it should be uphill from here. Our economic analysts are mildly optimistic and soon the treasurer might no longer have to say no to every other minister who comes to ask for a bigger budget."
FEA_banker_support:0 "Banker Support"
FEA_banker_support_desc:0 "Our decision to bailout the suffering banks within our borders, both Feathisian and International, had a side effect that may not have been entirely intentional. The Griffonian financial elite has heard of our ‘reasonable’ policies and has decided to support us. It can never hurt to have some friends who fly in high places."
FEA_worker_right_idea:0 "Arbeidswetten"
FEA_worker_right_idea_desc:0 "The Arbeidswetten, more commonly known to international observers as the Feathisian Labour Laws, are a package of laws designed to protect the rights of the working griffon. It contains laws for fair wages, workplace protection and working hours."
FEA_free_healthcare_idea:0 "Algemeen Ziekenfonds"
FEA_free_healthcare_idea_desc:0 "The General Sickfund is the national health insurance of Feathisia. Although wealthier Feathisians can still insure themselves privately, the Feathisian government now makes it possible for those poorest griffons to get an insurance for themselves. Instead of giving a compensation to patients, the Sick Fund pays the bills directly, with the sick or injured workers never seeing a single bill. Even the way the fund is financed is a unique Feathisian compromise, with the worker paying some part directly, paying a percentage of their income and the employers also chipping in themselves."
FEA_mass_contruction_projects:0 "Arbeidsplan"
FEA_mass_contruction_projects_desc:0 "To keep every griffon working in these trying times, great public projects should be undertaken. Your education or background does not matter, every claw can hold a shovel! Be they parks, canals or bridges, we will find some project to work on for our jobless."
FEA_citizen_welfare:0 "Sociaal-Economische Raad"
FEA_citizen_welfare_desc:0 "The Socio-Economic Council is an idea proposed by the Harmonist factions in parliament. In it, trade unions and employers’ organizations meet together to try and find common grounds. The council had a rough start, but they are slowly getting used to cooperating, which will surely lead to both fairer working rights and less strikes. The griffons of Feathisia are learning that compromise can find a solution that works for all parties."
FEA_agrarian_idea:0 "Agrarisme"
FEA_agrarian_idea_desc:0 "We have embraced the philosophy of agrarianism. The griffon who works the earth is a true Feathisian. We will promote a simple life in the countryside as an important part of our culture and create a class of loyal farmers as the backbone of our nation."
FEA_labour_battalion_ideas:0 "Arbeidersbataljons"
FEA_labour_battalion_ideas_desc:0 "Patriotic unemployed griffons have been assigned to the Workers battalions. These groups will be used to quickly complete certain projects. Construction projects of vital importance and of course repairs to damaged factories and infrastructure. Additionally, contingents of these griffons will be placed under command of our engineers to help entrench our troops. Any griffon who will fall in service of their battalion will receive a medal."
FEA_state_union:0 "Staatsvakbond"
FEA_state_union_desc:0 "The State Union is a way to finally stop the influence of the meddling labour unions. By having labour under state control, we have made more straightforward regulations and wage contracts that favour us. This has increased our production, with only an acceptable loss in labour conditions."
FEA_farmer_funds:0 "Farmer-Fonds"
FEA_farmer_funds_desc:0 "We have created a fund to subsidise our primary sector, most importantly our farmers. With a bit of government help, farms and mines are now using the wonders of modern machinery to better extract resources. The popular measure has not only given us greater access to the wealth under our soil, it has also helped shore up political support for the government."
FEA_lightning_warfare:0 "Mobiele-Oorlogsvoering"
FEA_lightning_warfare_desc:0 "Our army has embraced mobile warfare. Bold and as quick as greased lightning, our armed forces will outmanoeuvre our foes. If our troops can move quickly, we can pick our battles and beat a larger army."
FEA_car_factories:0 "Entrop Manufactories"
FEA_car_factories_desc:0 "A massive investment into Entrop Manufactories has allowed us to set up their new production lines ourselves. Specifically tooled for military vehicles, their plants will churn out the tanks and trucks we will need to succeed in our war of movement."
FEA_lightning_warfare_2:0 "Mobiele-Oorlogsvoering"
FEA_lightning_warfare_2_desc:0 "Our army has mastered mobile warfare. Our tanks move faster than greased lightning, surprising and overpowering our stunned foes. Our officers have learned that our speed will allow them tactical superiority to surround and crush our opposition."
FEA_superior_idea:0 "Overweldigende Vuurkracht"
FEA_superior_idea_desc:0 "We have adopted the doctrine of superior firepower. Our army will focus on shooting as many shells and bullets to the enemy as possible. This will require a greater focus on logistics and tactical use of artillery. When our enemies are blasted into a thousand pieces, victory will merely be a formality."
FEA_artillery_factories:0 "Artillerie-Werken"
FEA_artillery_factories_desc:0 "Our national Artillery-Works will produce the field artillery we need to overpower our foes. A special factory tuned to make the howitzers and field cannons of our expanding arsenal.  Arcturius is on the side with the best artillery, after all."
FEA_spec_ops_initiative:0 "Commandotroepen"
FEA_spec_ops_initiative_desc:0 "We have founded the Commandotroops. This special corps trains for extraordinary terrain and weather and with the most exotic of armaments. They are the dagger that compliments the hammer of our artillery."
FEA_superior_idea_2:0 "Overweldigende Vuurkracht"
FEA_superior_idea_2_desc:0 " We have mastered the doctrine of superior firepower. Our army is trained to lob as many shells and bullets to the enemy as possible. Our commanders have honed their focus on logistics and tactical use of artillery. Our enemies will be blasted into a million pieces and victory is inevitable."
FEA_grand_idea:0 "Groot Strijdplan"
FEA_grand_idea_desc:0 "We have opted for the trusty doctrine of the Grand Battleplan. It is easier for us to train a larger army while using the tried and true tactics of the last millennium, but we shouldn’t expect miracles. In that regard, we have decided to mostly draft defensive strategies. Let the enemy break themselves on our meticulously crafted battle lines, we will simply lie in wait."
FEA_specialised_staff:0 "Specialised Staff"
FEA_specialised_staff_desc:0 "Now that we have familiarised ourselves with grand strategy, we have a large capable officer corps available for our army. In fact, we can assign extra aides and staff to assist the generals with planning. Four eyes see more than two, this should help further improve our planning."
FEA_grand_idea_2:0 "Groot Strijdplan"
FEA_grand_idea_2_desc:0 " We have mastered the trusty doctrine of the Grand Battleplan. We have been able to train many recruits in the wisdom of the last millennium. We have trained for many strategic defensive positions. The enemy will break on our impenetrably crafted battle lines, all we have to do is wait."
FEA_mass_idea:0 "Massa-Aanval"
FEA_mass_idea_desc:0 "We have made the uncomfortable decision of adapting the Mass Assault doctrine. Our army has faced the reality that we must train every able-bodied griffon we can find if we are to stand a chance against the enemies that surround us. With streamlined logistics and training ensure that we can match the armies of states with a larger population."
FEA_mass_idea_2:0 "Massa-aanval"
FEA_mass_idea_2_desc:0 " We have adapted to the Mass Assault doctrine. The reality is that every able-bodied griffon can fight if they must. Our officers are no longer ashamed, but proud of the common soldier and have learned to adapt. With good coordination we merely have to point and a wave of determined soldiers will flood our opponents."
FEA_naval_academy:0 "De Vlootacademie"
FEA_naval_academy_desc:0 "The Fleet Academy was, when the Griffonian Empire still stretched the continent, the pride of Feathisia. Here the most brilliant minds of the age would be turned into captains and admirals. The Academy is now open again and many cadets have signed up to become the core of a new age of Feathisian naval pride."
FEA_great_fleet:0 "De Grote Vloot"
FEA_great_fleet_desc:0 "Feathisian ships now proudly sail the free seas, our flag high in the mast! The Grand Fleet protects our trade lanes with unmatched courage. None of this would be possible, however, without our master shipwrights and designers. A few small details make all the difference, so that our battleships are the most efficient war machines on the big blue ocean."
FEA_naval_air_fleet:0 "Marine Luchtvaart"
FEA_naval_air_fleet_desc:0 "Feathisian carriers are a true marvel of engineering. Our pilots and sailors are both proud to serve on the gargantuan ships. De Marine Luchtvaart, or Naval Aviation branch of our armed forces is turning out to be one of the most popular. We are able to be pickier for recruits who get to pilot our carrier planes and this has made our carriers an even more terrifying foe than they already are."
FEA_beloved_monarch_2:0 "Duke Gerlach the Silent"
FEA_beloved_monarch_2_desc:0 "Grand Duke Gerlach IV Weijermars is known far and wide as one of the most reasonable leaders in Griffonia. The Duke, who earned his nickname ‘The Silent’ for his patience and calm, transformed his fief into the very first proper Constitutional Monarchy in Griffonia. The people of Feathisia love their Grand Duke and as long as he keeps listening to the concerns of his Griffons, this is unlikely to change"
FEA_aerial_superioriy:0 "Vliegende Luipaarden"
FEA_aerial_superioriy_desc:0 "The Flying Leopards are the best pilots in our air fleet. Every griffon boy has a poster of them in their room with their signature motto; ‘Small in number, large in merit!’ By both learning from and excessively advertising the success of the Leopards, they inspire all pilots to be even more bold in their dogfights."
FEA_strat_bombing_ideas:0 "Strategische Vernietiging"
FEA_strat_bombing_ideas_desc:0 "Our bombers are the battleships of the sky. We use them like a fleet, bombarding the enemy below. Our airmen have grown adept at using the large machines to battle even smaller and nimbler fighter planes, while the air force has developed advanced targeting to make sure every bomb hits the target for maximum impact."
FEA_unfunctional_government:0 "Governmental Crisis"
FEA_unfunctional_government_desc:0 "The so called Regency Debate has managed to tear any semblance of order in the Feathisian Parliament to pieces. As long standing grudes, disatisfaction with the ruling coalition's policies and general disatisfaction with the government have all finally reached a boiling point."
FEA_beloved_monarch_3:0 "Duke Gerlach the Silent"
FEA_beloved_monarch_3_desc:0 "Grand Duke Gerlach IV Weijermars is known far and wide as one of the most reasonable leaders in Griffonia. The Duke, who earned his nickname ‘The Silent’ for his patience and calm, transformed his fief into the very first proper Constitutional Monarchy in Griffonia. The people of Feathisia love their Grand Duke and as long as he keeps listening to the concerns of his Griffons, this is unlikely to change"
FEA_unfunctional_government_2:0 "Governmental Crisis"
FEA_unfunctional_government_2_desc:0 "The so called Regency Debate has managed to tear any semblance of order in the Feathisian Parliament to pieces. As long standing grudes, disatisfaction with the ruling coalition's policies and general disatisfaction with the government have all finally reached a boiling point."
FEA_FHP_PvdA_coalition:0 "FHP-PvdA Coalition"
FEA_FHP_PvdA_coalition_desc:0 "Perhaps by some cosmic accident or through sheer pragmatism the FHP and the PvdA have managed to form a coalition between their two parties"
FEA_LDP_FNV_coalition:0 "LDP-FNV Coalition"
FEA_LDP_FNV_coalition_desc:0 " Perhaps by some cosmic accident or through sheer pragmatism the LDP and the FNV have managed to form a coalition between their two parties"
FEA_proper_welfare:0 "Nationaal Welzijnsprogramma"
FEA_proper_welfare_desc:0 "The National Wellbeing Program will ensure that every citizen has a minimum of protection. No griffon shall go hungry or sleep without a roof over their heads. This way we ensure the loyalty and gratitude of the people of Feathisia, who deserve our best efforts."
FEA_youth_group_idea:0 "Jeugdwind"
FEA_youth_group_idea_desc:0 "The Youthwind has been the youth-wing of the FNV for some time. The organisation promotes patriotism and loyalty to the state. With the FNV party taking the lead in the coalition, it has been promoted to a government organisation. With increased funding the Jeugdwind can deliver a larger base of recruits for our military."
FEA_revived_nationalism_idea:0 "The Gold and Blue"
FEA_revived_nationalism_idea_desc:0 "The Gold and the Blue are the colours of our national flag. Now, finally after decades of downplaying the value of the nation, nationalism has finally returned to Feathisia. We are born under the Gold and Blue and by Boreas we will die for its honour if we have to."
FEA_feathisia_marches_on_idea:0 "Feathisia Marches On"
FEA_feathisia_marches_on_idea_desc:0 "Government by talk has finally been driven out in favour of a government of action. The FNV will make this grand country greater and more prosperous than ever before. We have not abandoned democracy, we are simply carrying out the will of the Feathisians.\n\nA great struggle lies before us against the forces of ruin and despair. But let us all proclaim: Feathisia is not finished. Feathisia is not dead! We will send all the world a message; Feathisia lives and marches on!"
FEA_paramilitary_troops:0 "Arendwachters"
FEA_paramilitary_troops_desc:0 "The Eagle Guards are the paramilitary units of the FNV. They started as an exercise outside the army, trained mostly by veterans who disliked the lack of funding for the proper armed forces. Highly motivated and loyal, the Arendwachters will make a nice addition to the Feathisian Army."
FEA_new_police_force_idea:0 "Korps Nationale Politie"
FEA_new_police_force_idea_desc:0 "The Feathisian Police Force used to be a collection of locally organised forces. That was great for knowing your local officer, but not very efficient. To cope with the challenges of a modern state and the crime it brings with it, the national police force has been organised from the local corps. All miscreants will learn that crime doesn't pay!"
FEA_ducal_guard:0 "Expanded Ducal Guard"
FEA_ducal_guard_desc:0 "The Ducal Guard is an organisation of loyal citizens who follow in the footstepts of Grand Duke Gerlach. All Feathisians who desire to follow this example must be brave, steafast and have an unwavering devotion to the ideals of Constitutionalism and compromise. Together, these griffons will guard not only the Grand Duke's life, but also his work and his values."
FEA_free_education:0 "De Leerplicht"
FEA_free_education_desc:0 "Under the mandatory learning act, all griffon young are now sent to school. There will be no more homeschooling and no more children working in the fields.

FEA_industrial_experts_idea:0 "Skilled Workers"
FEA_industrial_experts_idea_desc:0 "Our decision to make higher education available to more griffons has led to an influx of skilled engineers and workers. This will mean our factories and construction companies will never have a shortage of experts."
FEA_defense_of_the_homeland:0 "In Defense of the Fatherland"
FEA_defense_of_the_homeland_desc:0 "A nation is measured by the worth of its norms, values and the willingness of her citizens to defend them. Feathisians fight for the values of tolerance and compromise.\nIf we are nationalist, we are nationalist because our nation has the values we share. If we are militarist, that is to defend that which we hold dear. We feel in our hearts and know in our minds that those who fight on the side of the Arcturius' truth and Eyre's justice will triumph over any foe."
FEA_pillarized_system:0 "Verzuiling"
FEA_pillarized_system_desc:0 "A peculiar system of social segregation has arisen in Feathisia. Championed by the Harmonist faction, Pillarisation is a system in which all political parties get their own social sphere. These spheres have their own organisations, media and even sports clubs. To make sure the government keeps running, the leaders of all parties cooperate on the highest level.\nIt seems that every Griffon can be satisfied by just allowing them to form their own state within a state. These pillars that run vertically through society may seem strange to an outsider, but to a Feathisian, this seems perfectly normal."
FEA_new_army:0 "Loyal Army"
FEA_new_army_desc:0 "Those who join the Feathisian armed forces know what they are fighting for. They fight for the right to live their own life however they want. They do not deny others the right to do the same as well, even if that may be very different from their own ways. The overarching value is the freedom of choice, championed by the new coalition. That means the National Army can work together, even while every griffon may have a different goal at home."
FEA_open_door_policy_idea:0 "Opendeurbeleid"
FEA_open_door_policy_idea_desc:0 "Feathisia has opted on an open door policy on immigration. The nation needs workers for her factories, and as such we have decided to not be picky on who occupies those jobs. Some might have concerns over unrestricted immigration, but good old Feathisian tolerance will incorporate these new cultures as well."
FEA_open_to_world_idea:0 "The World's Crossroad"
FEA_open_to_world_idea_desc:0 "Feathisia sits on the crossroad between nations. Trade has always been in our blood as our ships sailed the seas in ages past. We have rekindled that ancient traders' mentality and have become the World's Crossrooad once again."
FEA_workshop_of_the_world_idea:0 "Workshop van de Wereld"
FEA_workshop_of_the_world_idea_desc:0 "All peoples of the world have heard of some sort of Feathisian product. Our factories turn to provide all the worlds' free nations with whichever their citizens might require. Feathisians take great pride in their international industry and our traders spread the word of our values far and wide. This in turns has an effect back home, where more griffons start to stand up for the values we ship all over the world."
FEA_new_army_idea:0 "The New Feathisian Army"
FEA_new_army_idea_desc:0 "The Feathisian Army has always been a strongpoint for conservatism. Under the new coalition, this has been broken up, however. Young and enthusiastic left-wing Griffons can now more easily join the ranks and fight for our newfound equality."
FEA_socialist_education_idea:0 "Socialistische Opvoeding"
FEA_socialist_education_idea_desc:0 "There is a new wind blowing in our public school, it is the wind of progress! We have streamlined and improved the curriculum. This way all young griffons will be made into citizens for a new age."
FEA_rising_star_idea:0 "The Rising Star"
FEA_rising_star_idea_desc:0 "In every factory the hymns of socialism are sung. On every field, the farmers now work in unison. In Feathisia we were wise enough to heed the call of a new age and forge a new path of equality. Many things are still left to be done, but all workers hope that Feathisia’s rising star will proof that moderate socialism is the way forward to establish paradise on this green planet. The Feathisians can do it together!"
FEA_ruined_economy:0 "Ruined Economy"
FEA_ruined_economy_desc:0 "In spite of efforts to fix it, the brief and bloody Feathisian Civil War has managed to utterly destroy our economy. Again."
FEA_vanguardism_idea:0 "Revolutionaire Voorhoede"
FEA_vanguardism_idea_desc:0 "The theory of communism teaches us that a vanguard of intellectuals, who have grasped the truth about class warfare, must lead the proletariat in the struggle for communism. With the Labour Party fully in charge of the country, the vanguard can finally lead the way into a bright future."
FEA_organized_workers_idea:0 "Organized Workers"
FEA_organized_workers_idea_desc:0 "All labour is now unionised and organised by the party. This way we will ensure no griffon will ever have to slave away in the factories. The people can finally enjoy the fruits of their labour themselves. And by the people we mean the state, of course."
FEA_communist_army_idea:0 "The FRL"
FEA_communist_army_idea_desc:0 "The Feathisian Revolutionary Army is the new name of our armed forces. The old duchy is gone and in its place stands the Workers’ Republic. These brave griffons will protect our newfound freedom with their lives!"
FEA_communal_farming_idea:0 "Landbouwcommunes"
FEA_communal_farming_idea_desc:0 "We have established Communal farming methods to better distribute the land amongst our farmers. These methods teach the socialist way to the countryside and increase the yield of our agriculture. No stomach will be left empty!"
FEA_communism_with_feathisian_characteristics_idea:0 "Communism with Feathisian Characteristics"
FEA_communism_with_feathisian_characteristics_idea_desc:0 "Feathisia is different and we have found a way to mix Stalliongradian communism with the local area. The Red Star waves over our capital, a testament to those who have fallen for our freedom. The Feathisian worker has won the future and we will not be easily swayed to abandon our ways."
FEA_education_reform_communist_idea_1:0 "Education Reform"
FEA_education_reform_communist_idea_1_desc:0 "The new Feathisian education system has been repurposed to follow practical skills instead of bourgeoisie hobbies. All griffons will learn about machinery and planning for the good of society. Who needs artists anyway?"
FEA_communist_army_idea_2:0 "An Army of Militias"
FEA_communist_army_idea_2_desc:0 "Every Union has its own militia. This way the workers own not only the means of production, but also the means to defend themselves from any sort of oppression. They train in the evening after work and are highly motivated to defend our new state. The fact that every unit insists on voting on any manoeuvre before following an order might make commanding this army a hard task, however."
FEA_education_reform_communist_idea_2:0 "Education Reform"
FEA_education_reform_communist_idea_2_desc:0 "The old education system has been swept away by the revolution and in its place we have created an education on the virtues of socialism. This will surely help increase the population’s willingness to defend the revolution!"
FEA_industrialisation_plan:0 "Nationale Industrialisatie-Inspanning"
FEA_industrialisation_plan_desc:0 "The National Industrialisation Effort has been chosen to radically and forcefully increase our production capacities. The Feathisian State must be well armed and well prepared if we are to face the challenges of the future. All citizens will be required to do their part, or else."
FEA_secret_police_idea:0 "Staatspolitie"
FEA_secret_police_idea_desc:0 "The Secret State Police monitors our citizenry for any counter-revolutionary behaviour.  Of course all loyal Feathisians have nothing to fear and will be recruited to help the Staatspolitie network themselves. Secret policegriffons have also been embedded into our army units and we have made the soldiers aware of this to increase their loyalty."
FEA_strasserite_army:0 "De Heerschaar"
FEA_strasserite_army_desc:0 "The new Feathisian Heerschaar, an old world for army, will spread the revolution far and wide. The national-revolutionary spirit runs within the veins of the military and their efforts embolden us. Soon Feathisia’s revolution will live in glory the world over!"
FEA_the_new_heartland_ideas:0 "The New Age"
FEA_the_new_heartland_ideas_desc:0 "A new Age has dawned for our country. All Griffons have joined in the Rozenkamp brothers’ efforts to support the uniquely Feathisian National-Revolution. Our Heerschaar marches proudly through the streets, cheered on by the workers, who labour to construct the new age! The capitalists have found themselves a new mortal enemy in Feathisia and we will root out and exterminate their heinous system."

feat.20.t:0 "Heeren's Grand Speech"
feat.20.d:0 "Rottendedam was gripped with excitement and dread as the FNV Deputy Godfried Heeren gave a speech to a crowd of fanatic supporters and onlookers. In his speech he addressed the struggling economy of Feathisia, stating that the reasons for these economic malaise were Feathisia's unstable and hawkish neighbors, constantly warring with each other. Furthermore he blamed the inept businessmen and bureaucrats leading Skyfall whome he called out for caring little for the average Griffon, rather only worrying about lining their own pockets. More concerningly Heeren also blamed the local Pony population of Rottendam, calling them parasites and leeches who only seek to work against the interests of Feathisia and her people. Heeren's fiery speech and bold accusations naturally sparked outrage amongst most of the population. However it seems that in spite of this the Bronzen Schildwachten branch of the FNV just became a lot more popular..."

feat.21.t:0 "For My Sentinels"
feat.21.d:0 "In an economic slump unlike many others, it is impressive to see new books being published, in this case it is a single best seller written by the FNV Chief Deputy Godfriend Hereen. Titled 'To My Sentinels' the book details his time spent training with the Orangecoats, the paramilitary arm of the Bronze Sentinels, one of the many far-right parties that were integrated into the FNV. He is quite proud of the organization, and considers them to be the safeguards of Fethsian ideals, history, and identity. This had caused all manner of speculation within the Duchy, leading many to believe he had received funding from some powerful friends within the government, or perhaps even foreign aid? Only time will tell however, as it just surpasses the recently published 'Daring Doo' novel. "
