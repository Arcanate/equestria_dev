FEA_crashed_economy:0 "Ruined Economy"
FEA_crashed_economy_desc:0 "Feathisia has always been one of the richest constituent states of the Griffonian Empire, with flourishing trade and adventurous explorers bringing the Duchy great wealth. The nigh constant warfare across the continent that followed the crumbling of the Griffonian Empire had pushed the economy to the brink. Now Skyfall, Feathisia's greatest trading partner, has fallen into chaos, with the bankruptcy of the firms that traded with the Trade Federation causing a ripple effect through the economy. Dealing with the economic should be the first priority of the Feathisian government. "
FEA_beloved_monarch:0 "Duke Gerlach the Silent"
FEA_beloved_monarch_desc:0 "Grand Duke Gerlach IV Weijermars is known far and wide as one of the most reasonable leaders in Griffonia. The Duke, who earned his nickname ‘The Silent’ for his patience and calm, transformed his fief into the very first proper Constitutional Monarchy in Griffonia. The people of Feathisia love their Grand Duke and as long as he keeps listening to the concerns of his griffons, this is unlikely to change."
FEA_danger_in_the_coalition:0 "Crisis in the Coalition"
FEA_danger_in_the_coalition_desc:0 "The recent economic troubles plaguing Feathisia have led to a divide between the ruling FHP-LDP Coalition and allowed for more extreme parties to gain prominence within the Parliament. The Communist alliance of the Partij van de Arbeid, represents the far left of Feathisian politics and they argue that this crisis shows the failings of the capitalist system. The Far right has rallied around the FNV, the Feathisian National Union. They argue that only an iron claw from above can guide Feathisia back to prosperity.  Some fear that if the issues within the Coalition are not addressed properly it could lead to a general collapse of the governing coalition and, in the most extreme case, a takeover by one of the radical parties."
