 wingbardy.1.t:0 "The Death of General Giuseppe Gellera"
 wingbardy.1.d:0 "General Giuseppe Gellera has been killed in action.\n\nWhile defending an important road, Gellera's troops found themselves cut off by the enemy and facing encirclement. Gellera personally took command of one of the few functioning tanks and lead the breakout effort. However, during the action, he was hit by an anti-tank shell and took shrapnel to the lungs. He died few hours later in an enemy hospital.\n\nFor his gallantry in action Gellera has been posthumously awarded with the Gold Medal of Military Valour. Wingbardy's highest military decoration."
 wingbardy.1.a:0 "A living general is better then a dead hero."

 wingbardy.2.t:0 "Wingbardy Claims the Griffonstone Crown"
 wingbardy.2.d:0 "Mounting political pressure has come to a head today with the Wingbardian Government granting the king of Wingbardy the crown of Griffonstone. Such an act has shoked Griffons throught the nation. Officals appointed by the Wingbardian government are alredy making moves to intergrate what little freedoms we had with Wingbardy, forming an end of our two nations."
 wingbardy.2.a:0 "We welcome our king."
 wingbardy.2.b:0 "We shall stand for our freedom!"
 
 wingbardy.3.t:0 "Griffonstone Folds"
 wingbardy.3.d:0 "The Griffonstone government has been fully integrated into our own with little opposition."
 wingbardy.3.a:0 "Long live the king."
 
 wingbardy.4.t:0 "Griffonstone Rebels!"
 wingbardy.4.d:0 "Forces still loyal to the Griffonstone government have rounded up our officials in protest of our planned merging of our nations. For all intents and purpouses, Griffonstone is now free from our control."
 wingbardy.4.a:0 "They shall pay for this treachery."

 wingbardy.5.t:0 "King Garibald Talonuel III has Died"
 wingbardy.5.d:0 "King Garibald Talonuel III passed away this morning after a period of illness. Ever since the murder of his father in 971, Garibald Talonuel has led Wingbardy through times of both triumph and hardship. He was instrumental in the collapse of the Griffonian Empire, protected the south from Imperial aggression and united the nation through the long and bloody war with Falcor. Garibald Talonuel was also a prolific coin collector with over 100,000 coins in his private collection, each of them personally documented and studied. He left his collection to the National Karthinian Museum for all Wingbardians to enjoy.\n\nThe throne now passes to his son Prince Gumberto, who is a mere shadow of his father. His life has been one of scandal and criticism with many prominent Wingbardians having openly spoken out against him. Only time will tell what kind of King he will make."
 wingbardy.5.a:0 "All Wingbardians mourn today."

 wingbardy.6.t:0 "The National Anthem Debate"
 wingbardy.6.d:0 "In recent days, a debate has been growing out of the Blackshirt's control over the national anthem of Wingbardy. La Marcia Reale d'Ordinanza has been the national anthem for close to 100 years, but ever since Beakolini and his Fascist took power their own anthem, Giovinezza, has (often forcefully) supplanted it. Those loyal to the King see this as a great betrayal of Wingbardian tradition, but the King has remained silent on the issue. There is now a debate in parliament on whether la Marcia Reale d'Ordinanza should be officially replaced by Giovinezza as the official national anthem of the nation.\n\nIt is expected to go the Blackshirt's way, after all, la Marcia Reale d'Ordinanza has no official lyrics while Giovinezza has such wonderful verses as \"With a Wingbardian's pride swear fealty to Beakolini\". This mandatory anthem is merely the griffons showing how much they love Il Duce. \n\nUnlike his father, Prince Gumberto has not remained silent on the issue. He has instead proposed La Leggenda del Piumave as a compromise. The popular song dates to the Falcor War and tales of the flooding of the river Piumave, halting Falcor's invasion of Wingbardy shortly after the disastrous battle at Clawporetto and how it allowed the Regio Esercito time to launch the counter attack required to push Falcor back and to final victory at the battle of Garibald Gergamo.\n\nWith the debate being held, who will carry the day?"
 wingbardy.6.a:0 "La Marcia Reale d'Ordinanza is the true anthem of Wingbardy!"
 wingbardy.6.b:0 "Giovinezza! For Youth! For Beakolini!"
 wingbardy.6.c:0 "La Leggenda del Piumave will be a great compromise."
 
 wingbardy.7.t:0 "Wingbardy Sues For Peace"
 wingbardy.7.d:0 "A communique from [From.GetLeader] has been received, asking for peace. New Mareland has capitulated, Sunset has fallen and [EQC.GetLeader]'s government has been forced into exile. It would be difficult for us to liberate our colony from the griffon claws, for the sea between us is wide and the Wingbardian navy is a threat that may be too great to overcome. However, would this be a betrayal of our loyal subjects down under? Should we keep waging a futile war, hoping that one day the New Marelander flag flies once more atop Sunset?"
 wingbardy.7.a:0 "They have won."
 wingbardy.7.b:0 "We won't abandon our friends!"
 
 wingbardy.8.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses"
 wingbardy.8.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] has foolishly refused our benign and reasonable call for peace between our nations. They want to keep fighting, vainly hoping to greedily seize New Mareland from our claws. Very well, let them come! The royal navy is ready to face them."
 wingbardy.8.a:0 "New Mareland is ours!"

 wingbardy.9.t:0 "The Fascists Seize Karthin"
 wingbardy.9.d:0 "#TODO: The fascists march into the city and seize the city by force. There is rampant violance in the streets as the blackwings battle with the police and anti-facscist groups. Buildings are burnt down and looting occurs. The fascists storm parliment. The royal palace remains untouched. As night falls the King sends out a radio brodcast saying he's invited Beakolini to form a government, but the situation is very unstable."
 wingbardy.9.a:0 "At least it's over..."

 wingbardy.10.t:0 "The Meeting"
 wingbardy.10.d:0 "#TODO: King meets with Beakolini. King Crysalis, insert here your magnum opus of events."

 wingbardy.11.t:0 "Martial Law"
 wingbardy.11.d:0 "#TODO: Gallo meets with King and finally convinces him to declare martial law, allowing for the crackdown of the Blackwings."
 wingbardy.11.a:0 "Let's hope this goes smoothly."
 
 wingbardy.50.t:0 "Communists Seize Power! Civil War Has Begun!"
 wingbardy.50.d:0 "The riots throughout our cities has broken out into a full blown civil war. Communist forces have taken the capital and other cities along the coast, driving the Fascists and Royalists inland. With the King's blessing, Beakolini has taken command of the Royalist Government and swears to end our revolution."
 wingbardy.50.a:0 "Viva la rivoluzione!"

 wingbardy.51.t:0 "The Civil War is Over!"
 wingbardy.51.d:0 "Beakolini is dead and the former King has fled the nation. The few remaining fascists have either surrendered, fled or have taken their own lives as our forces liberate the last remaining strongholds.\n\nThe war is finally over and the griffons are celebrating in the streets! The future of Wingbardy looks bright for all griffons."
 wingbardy.51.a:0 "Now to rebuild."

 wingbardy.101.t:0 "The Southern Military Strategy"
 wingbardy.101.d:0 "Wingbardian military planners have proposed a united strategy for the defence of our nations and the South. By creating a Joint Defence Command, we can improve our battle plans in the event of any military action."
 wingbardy.101.a:0 "A great idea!"
 
 wingbardy.102.t:0 "Wingbardy Demands New Mareland"
 wingbardy.102.d:0 "The ambassador from Wingbardy presented an ultimatum this morning. Citing the illegitimate occupation of griffon land, subjugation of griffons, and illegal pony settlements, Wingbardy is demanding that we renounce all claim to the colonies of New Mareland and allow native griffons a rightful place in the colonial management.\n\nObviously, this is sure to result in the Wingbardian occupation of the New Mareland ponies, all of whom will undoubtedly be threatened by the new regime."
 wingbardy.102.a:0 "In the name of Peace, we must accept."
 wingbardy.102.b:0 "We shall not let our ponies suffer under griffon talons."
 
 wingbardy.1021.t:0 "[From.GetName] has Betrayed Us!"
 wingbardy.1021.d:0 "Under pressure from the Wingbardian government, Equestria has agreed to hand over control of our government to Wingbardy. [Root.GetLeader] has received direct orders to stand down and hand over power to Wingbardy's chosen replacement. This act of betrayal has shocked the nation. Thousands have taken to the streets in protests and popularity with pro-independence factions as skyrocketed.\n\nWith Wingbardy already forcing their troops over the border, our independence hangs in the balance."
 wingbardy.1021.a:0 "We cannot resist this..."
 wingbardy.1021.b:0 "They'll have to take our freedom from our cold, dead hooves!"
 
 wingbardy.1022.t:0 "Wingbardy has Demanded Our Annexation!"
 wingbardy.1022.d:0 "The Wingbardian ambassador to Equestria handed over a list of outrageous demands that would result in the total annexation of Wingbardy under the guise of 'freeing' the native population of our nation. As expected, the Princess has thrown those bird-brains out on their arses.\n\nBut they didn't appear to get the message as their troops are lining our border looking for a fight."
 wingbardy.1022.a:0 "We must prepare for war."
 
 wingbardy.103.t:0 "Intervene in New Mareland's Civil War"
 wingbardy.103.a:0 "#TODO (Maybe? Literally no one has ever seen this event. If you're the first person to see it, congratulations! Please complain in the bug reporting forum.) Annex Civil War New Mareland States"
 wingbardy.103.b:0 "We shall put an end to their internal strife."
 
 wingbardy.104.t:0 "Wingbardy Demands our Annexation!"
 wingbardy.104.d:0 "The ambassador from Wingbardy presented an ultimatum this morning. Citing the illegitimate occupation of griffon land, subjugation of griffons, and illegal pony settlements, Wingbardy is demanding that we allow Wingbardian representatives in as advisers in key government positions and for us to enact emergency pro-griffon laws.\n\nObviously, this is sure to result in the Wingbardian occupation of our nation and a great threat to our citizens."
 wingbardy.104.a:0 "There's nothing we can do."
 wingbardy.104.b:0 "We'll show those bird-brains what for!"
 
 wingbardy.105.t:0 "[From.GetName] Gives In"
 wingbardy.105.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] has agreed with our just demands and they have surrendered the colony to us. The local griffons rejoice and welcome us as liberators, while the ponies cower in their homes. We will prove them that we are more benevolent overlords and treat them better than they treated the griffon minority."
 wingbardy.105.a:0 "As expected."
 
 wingbardy.1051.t:0 "[From.GetName] Gives In"
 wingbardy.1051.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] has agreed with our just demands and the colony has surrendered to us.

 wingbardy.106.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses Our Demands"

 wingbardy.1061.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses Our Demands"
 wingbardy.1061.d:0 "Not only did they reject our demands, they kicked our ambassador out of the nation with a giant boot."
 wingbardy.1061.a:0 "So, it's war then."
 
 wingbardy.107.t:0 "An \"Offer\" from Wingbardy"
 wingbardy.107.d:0 "After weeks of negotiations Wingbardy has presented us with an ultimatum. Either we stand down our armies, allow Wingbardian officials to oversee all aspects of our government and accept the Wingbardian rules of law, or a state of war will exist between us and [WNG.GetName]."
 wingbardy.107.a:0 "Perhaps things won't be so bad if we accept..."
 wingbardy.107.b:0 "We won't go down without a fight!"

 wingbardy.108.t:0 "Falcor Refuses!"
 wingbardy.108.d:0 "Our demands were refused by the Falcorian government, and our ambassador has been expelled from the country."

 wingbardy.109.d:0 "Our diplomatic corps in Falcor has succeeded in its task, and while there were much grumbling from the Falcorians, our ambassador returned with an agreement for Falcor to accept Wingbardian annexation."

 wingbardy.111.t:0 "Falcor Accepts our Alliance"
 wingbardy.111.d:0 "Shocking even our ambassador in Matton, Falcor has agreed to accept our offer and has expedited their diplomatic missions to all alliance members."

 wingbardy.112.t:0 "Falcor Demands the Return of their Capital"
 wingbardy.112.d:0 "In exchange for accepting an alliance with us, Falcor demands that their capital is returned to them. The city of Falcor was seized from them in the war 20 years ago and has been an important part of the Kingdom ever since. What instructions should we send to our embassy in Matton?"
 wingbardy.112.a:0 "We accept their terms."
 wingbardy.112.b:0 "Never! Good Wingbardians died for that city!"
 wingbardy.112.c:0 "They'll pay for this insolence!"

 wingbardy.120.t:0 "A Wingbardian Alliance Offer"
 wingbardy.120.d:0 "A Wingbardian delegation has arrived at our capital, coming with an invitation for our nation to join their alliance, [From.GetFactionName]. They say that we can only oppose vile communists and northern imperialists together, and that alone we are doomed.\n\nWingbardy would indeed be a powerful ally, but we must question if we wish to allow them to expand their influence. Besides, can [From.GetLeader] truly be trusted?"
 wingbardy.120.a:0 "We accept!"
 wingbardy.120.b:0 "We have no interest in such things."

 wingbardy.121.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Accepts"
 wingbardy.121.d:0 "After some delay, our diplomatic mission to [From.Capital.GetName] has returned bearing news of success. [From.GetNameDef] has accepted our invitation and formally joins [Root.GetFactionName]. Our alliance grows ever stronger!"

 wingbardy.122.d:0 "After a significant delay, our diplomats have returned from [From.Capital.GetName] with empty talons: [From.GetNameDef] is unfortunately not interested in joining [Root.GetFactionName]. Whatever the reason, we must now reconsider our plans for them."

 wingbardy.144.t:0 "The Gattei Way"
 wingbardy.144.d:0 "The foundation of the AGWP has not been an easy affair. Due to the poor economic situation of the kingdom, the project was originally underfunded. The original chairgriffon put in charge of the operation quickly departed for fear he was set up for failure or worse. In his stead emerged Genrico Gattei. Gattei was known as a rather crafty industrialist in Taloncana. Some of his ventures were impacted but instead of abandoning them like some others when the AGWP was created, he embraced it and began to lobby the government over participation in it. After all within the government began to see the position as doomed to fail, it was awarded to Gattei.\n\nUnder Gattei's leadership, the company was reorganised more efficiently along less bureaucratic lines. However, the budget of the AGWP was still an issue. Gattei's answer to it was the Taloncana scheme. With much fanfare and press coverage, he announced that incredibly rich methane and oil deposits were found in Taloncana and that soon, Wingbardy would become oil-independent. This quickly rose confidence in the company and many rich Wingbardians and capitalists began to buy into it, providing the company with some much-needed cash.\n\nThe reality was a bit less fantastic. Oil deposits were indeed found but they were very poor compared to the methane reserves. What he did was using natural gas instead to boost the development of national industry in the region. The gas would be a cheaper and more functional substitute for the all-important coal imported at great expenses. As many of these industry belonged to Gattei's family or friends, he benefited highly from the move. This could have been one of the greatest scandal in Wingbardian history but the move ultimately lead to a boom in the region and the high profits were plowed back into the various branches of the AGWP, allowing to grow even more and strike actual oil deposits.\n\nFar from getting fired over the scheme, Gattei became a media darling and a powerful political actor. Some are calling him corrupt and the move a threat to our government's integrity. Gattei prefers to call himself 'innovative'."

 wingbardy.34.t:0 "The Dream"
 wingbardy.34.d:0 "Garibald Talonuel stepped out of the light of the doorway and onto the smooth cobbles of the courtyard. The grand walls of the Imperial Palace stood high all around. The golden light glowed in the many windows like the sun rising on a hall of mirrors. He could still hear the laughs from the decadent Griffenheim elite, but the part was anything but jovial. There was a pressure in the air. Like a string under tension on the verge of snapping. Surely everyone but the 12-year old Emperor could feel it.\n\nKing Gumberto of Wingbardy had kept a civil face throughout the whole ordeal and when Emperor Grover V had drifted asleep on his throne, he had taken his leave. “Meet me outside in fifteen minutes,” the king said to Garibald. Now Garibald peered out into the dim light of the courtyard. It wasn’t long until a pair of griffons came into sight, even in the darkness he could make out his father’s shape. He headed towards them. The pair of griffons argued in hushed voices. Suddenly there was the flash of a knife and a half-scream choked out of existence as it left his father’s throat.\n\nGaribald held his father in his arms, not caring for the blood that soiled his robes. There was so much of it. He screamed for help, but his father took his claw. The king tried to say something but all that came out was one last choke before he went limp.\n\nThe nobles came one by one and gathered around them like a wake of vultures. Even the young emperor still holding his doll and rubbing the sleep from his eyes – The Duke of Strawberry made sure he had a front row seat.\n\nGaribald awoke, not with a start, but with a pained tiredness. The early light of dawn lazily flowed through his windows. He glanced at the photograph by his bed of his late wife and young son before slowly rising to his feet. He stepped out onto his villa’s balcony and stared out across the olive trees and vineyards. His father’s killer was still out there, somewhere. All these years later he was no closer to the truth. But it was never too late to start looking."

 news_wingbardy.1.t:0 "The March on Karthin"
 news_wingbardy.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]For months, the right-wing journalist Giulio Beakolini has been clamouring for re-establishing order in the streets of Wingbardy's cities and in its government. His fascist party has garnered immense support, with many flocking to Beakolini's message of a restoration of the 'ancient Wingbardian order'. Many of these self-styled 'Blackwings' are former soldiers and veterans, providing the PNF with a substantial paramilitary force.\n\nMany moderates and socialists in the government were shocked to learn that King Garibald has no intention to stop a planned march on Karthin by the fascists. With government troops standing down, many in the capital nervously watch as thousands of black-clad fascists march towards them..."

 news_wingbardy.2.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]An intense week of backroom meetings between the King and Beakolini has finally produced a result. The King spoke to a large crowd in Karthin, announcing Giulio Beakolini, leader of the far-right PNF, as Wingbardy's new Prime Minister.\n\nReplacing the previous Gacta government, Beakolini has formed a new cabinet, surprising most with the inclusion of socialist ministers, and has promised a swift end to the political deadlock.\n\nExperts are skeptical of his chances, but there is a certain sense of hope among the common Wingbardians. Perhaps the self-fashioned 'Duce' may bring about order."

It was a close vote, but it is believed that the moderates were key for the motion to pass the floor.\n\nAs a result, there have been many arrests of left-wing party members who refuse to renounce their party loyalty, though many have wisened up and either done so or have fled abroad. What few communist and socialist elements that still exist in Wingbardy are now underground, and the PNF has seen a massive spike in membership numbers."

Many however expect a fascist majority regardless of the results. This may well be the end of democratic rule in Wingbardy."
