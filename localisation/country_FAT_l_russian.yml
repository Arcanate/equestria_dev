 FAT_centrism_desc:0 "The right wing of the National Republican Party is an interesting development in the history of the Republic. Once a social-democratic, revoultionary movement, the majority of the Republic's ruling party now supports pragmatic policy, conservative economics, and integration of the Cloudburian natives into the ranks of the NRP. With a defensive-minded foreign policy, an internal policy built on unity and concessions, and an economic policy built on stability and security, the NRP-Right espouses much different principles than the revolutionaries of 978, but surely this is the right path for the Republic."
 FAT_liberalism_desc:0 "The center wing of the National Republican Party, made up mostly of the stalwarts of 978, has kept the principles of Republicanism in their hearts. Revolutionary pan-griffonian idealism, economic social-democracy and welfare programs, along with a militaristic and anti-monarchist view characterize the NRP-Center. Its leadership, made up mostly of generals such as Schnabel Sunglider and Walter Emerich, has remained loyal to the Three Principles of Liberty, Demcocracy, and Prosperity - for all griffons!"
 FAT_democratic_socialism_desc:0 "The left wing of the National Republican Party has risen to prominence mostly in the last few years. Made up of young, idealist leaders, the party asserts that the revolutionary principles of 978 must be continued and brought into a new age. The faction claims that instead of social democracy and foreign anti-communism, worker's self management and a Skynavian thaw should be pursued. The party is vehemently against the Old Guard of the Republic, and advocates for the complete and utter dismantlement of the Kemerskai personality cult. A young and radical movement, many have criticized the NRP-Left for its "authoritarianism" and "disdain for liberal groups"."

 FAT_battleship_focus:0 "Saxhagen-Plumenjar Doctrine"
 FAT_battleship_focus_desc:0 "Otto Saxhagen-Plumenjar is loosely related to the Cloudburian royal family, and is technically the heir to the remnants of the dynasty. Despite his royal blood, Kemerskai kept him and his mother alive, and allowed him to become an admiral as a concession to monarchists. Otto is a strong proponent of naval forces that can squash the enemy through sheer numbers, armour, and calibre."
 FAT_destroyer_focus:0 "Hassentelf Doctrine"
 FAT_destroyer_focus_desc:0 "Hermann Hassentelf is a prominent and loyal Republican admiral, serving in the Revolution of 978 as a naval officer and being promoted to Admiral after the Long March. Due to his lack of access to battleships and carriers as an officer, he has become an expert and a strong supporter of a smaller strike fleet. He argues that battleships and too slow for fast-paced naval combat."

Тем не менее, большая часть используемого там оборудования устарела. Если бы мы выделили средства и национализировали все верфи, мы могли бы легко превратить Вингхадген в самый большой порт северной Грифонии."
 FAT_navy_doctrine:0 "Сфокусироваться на нашей доктрине"
 FAT_navy_doctrine_desc:0 "Как и все грифоны, наше новое адмиралтейство любит много спорить. Это довольно непродуктивно. Но если мы будем уделять особое внимание сосредоточению наших офицеров и адмиралов на совместной работе вместо того, чтобы спорить, это было бы очень полезно для всех нас."

 FAT_new_battleships_desc:0 "Линейные корабли должны быть бесспорными правителями морской войны, ясно, что они решат исход всех морских сражений, поэтому мы должны получить их в распоряжение.

 FAT_new_destroyers:0 "Купить эсминцы"
 FAT_new_destroyers_desc:0 "Эсминцы составляют основу нашего флота, это не изменится в ближайшее время.

 FAT_more_navy_investment_desc:0 "Our only port on Sky Bay is in the city of Winghaven. However, if Winghaven gets destroyed by an enemy or even by a natural disaster, we would have no naval port to dock our ships.

 FAT_fighter_focus:0 "Править небесами"
 FAT_fighter_focus_desc:0 "Самой важной частью воздушной войны является контроль над небом, и поэтому мы должны сосредоточить свои усилия на создании самолетов, которые позволили бы нам это сделать.

 FAT_grand_3:0 "Перетасовать наш штаб"
 FAT_grand_3_desc:0 "Наши недавние изменения в нашей армии, в настоящее время, в основном позаботились о наших верховных командирах и наших подразделениях.

 FAT_superior_3:0 "Выделенные артиллерийские расчеты"
 FAT_superior_3_desc:0 "Теперь, когда мы уверены, что артиллерийский огонь не закончится массовыми жертвами на нашей стороне, мы должны дать нашим дивизиям специальные небольшие артиллерийские расчеты, дабы наши подразделения всегда могли взять даже самую укрепленную позицию противника."

 FAT_sup:0 "Реорганизация подразделений поддержки"
 FAT_sup_desc:0 "Хотя солдаты с оружием являются основной силой в армии, единицы, которые оказывают им поддержку, одинаково важны.

Trained in law and economics, the young Kingfeather did not seem like a suitable candidate for a revoultionary leader at all, but his progressive legal precedents led him to become one of Republicanism's staunchest defenders. As a lawyer and politician first and revolutionary second, Kingfeather advocated for Republicanism at the international level, attempting numerous deals with both Equestria and the River Coalition - both who largely denied his advances. His legal and political action during Kemerskai's term eased public instability and anger at the Republicans, but it could not save the revoultion militarily.\n\nKingfeather, instead of participating in the Long March, fled to Skyfall and then the newly independent City of Fezera, before finally arriving in the Republic to cheering crowds after its control over Cloudbury was secured. Although his inability to support the Republicans in the Long March was a point of disaproval for many, Kingfeather continued to represent the people of the Republic in their new seat in Cloudbury.\n\nKingfeather's work has largely been behind the scenes since he became Kemerskai's second-in-command in 1003, replacing ambitious militarist Schnabel Sunglider with a focus on largely domestic issues. Faced with an unruly military and banditry in the countryside, Kingfeather began to construct a policy that countered Sunglider's beliefs of violent reaction to dissidence. Kingfeather met with hundreds of native leaders in acts that helped mend the complete chaos in the countryside following Rosewing's initial agitation, acts that led him to become one of the most pro-native leaders on the national level. Pragmatism was Kingfeather's main goal, a goal that became more and more difficult with the polarization of the country between political and ethnic lines.\n\nWill he ever succeed? Or will he die with all the cards in his hands and no bravery to use them, as his opposition claims?"

It is unknown what their plans are, but government agents think they oppose the reforms of the military and are plotting a coup to prvent any check on their banditry and scandalous military practices. Claus Rosewing has been alleged to be part of the Griffonian National Revolutionary Front, an underground nationalist group that opposes both democracy and monarchy, believing a strong, powerful leader can guide the Republic to glory. But if we want to encourage this behavior, maybe we should do nothing..."

This could easily prove problematic for our government, as if Rosewing and Suntail ever revolt against the government, they will have the power of many once-loyalt roops on their side."

 griffonRepublic.18.d:0 "General Rosewing is one of the most prominent warlords in the republic. While his troops and mandate are supported by the government itself, he seems to only act more independently of the high command everyday, with his forces even raiding local encampments of troops loyal to us. Today, the Republican army held a meeting with Rosewing, in which he claimed he had nothing to do with the raids, and that his regiments had strict punishments for raiding anyway, so there would be no precedent for raiding in his regime. He blamed the entirety of the problems with the unruly army on Suntail and a few unruly soldiers within his army, saying that he had always been loyal to the republic and he would never do such a thing."
 griffonRepublic.18.a:0 "An interesting conversation."
 
 griffonRepublic.19.t:0 "A Meeting with Suntail"
 griffonRepublic.19.d:0 "General Suntail is an incredibly controversial public figure. At 17, he joined the Republican Army and participated in the revoultion that brought an end to the Griffonian monarchy. As the years have gone on, however, he has become more radical and more disillusioned with the Republican dream. Having a meeting with the most dangerous griffon in Griffonia was no small task, but at the end, Suntail demanded 3 major concessions. His first demand was the legalization of the National Revolutionary Front, an underground ultranationalist organization that was convicted of multiple terrorist attacks in 1003 and subsequently banned. The second demand was the pardoning of all raiders, except the radical ones, which he claimed he would "sort out" on his own. The third demand was millions of idols for his troops to "supply"."
 griffonRepublic.19.a:0 "I don't think we have a choice."
 
 griffonRepublic.199.t:0 "The Generals Submit"
 griffonRepublic.199.d:0 "Rosewing and Suntail have come to the Imperial Capital with their most prominent officers on direct order of President-Marshal Kemerskai. The details of the meeting were completely obscured to the people, but journalists believed it was a discussion to finally end the question of banditry in the countryside.

Любые перевозки продовольствия уже подвергаются большому риску подвергнуться набегам со стороны жадных бандитов или просто голодающих и отчаявшихся грифонов.

Таким образом, мы должны принять серьезное решение в нашей политике по отношению к ним. Мы или позволим монархии процветать сейчас, под мудрым и заботливым королем, но рискуем еще одним тираном в будущем.

Ну, до сих пор слепые не смогли читать. Но изобретатель, который сам слеп, заявляет, что эта новая методика позволит слепым грифонам читать.

Опасения, что государственные секреты, возможно, стали известны мисс Чикеле, а позже были раскрыты во время разговоров в постели, привели к призывам отправить министра обороны в отставку и провести дальнейшее расследование в его отношении. Джаксон Перфизерейн отрицает любые претензии о ненадлежащем поведении, но подал заявление об отставке президенту.

Kemerksai's second principle - Democracy, was replaced with Nationalism, the belief that the revolution must encompass all Griffons, and that the Republic should embody a patriotic, ultranationalist movement. The crowds still cheered for Suntail's reforms, but they were cheering for an amalgamation of the original three principles.

Whitefeather's troops seized most of the northern Republic, allying with conservative leader Heinrich Kingfeather. The rebellion is also thought to have spread into areas of Skynavia, where Governor Asper Sickleclaw has pledged his full loyalty to the Republic in the troubles against the Whitefeather regime. Kemerskai has delivered a speech to the people of the nation, declaring that the Republic will never perish from this earth, and ended his speech with the line "While cowards flinch and traitors sneer, we'll keep the tricolour flying here!", a reference to a popular patriotic song, "The Tricolour."

Led by Heinrich Kingfeather, who supported Kemerskai's suspension of the constitution and despotic government.\n\n If not purged from our government, the party could pose a threat to our new democratic socialist government.

With almost twenty years of banditry, chaos, and political instability due to Kemerskai's suspension of the 978 Constitution in 986, opposition forces have risen considerably in power, especially socialists.\n\nOne such opposition politician, Rikard Astler, has rallied the left behind a new wing of the NRP, one that is socialist but still subscribes to the principles of bourgeois democracy, unlike the systems put forward in Skynavia or proposed by revolutionaries in Prywhen. Astler's democratic socialist ideals have quickly gained support as many no longer trust Kemerskai to actually bring Republicanism to the people.\n\nSocialist councillors have begun a plan to rally the people under their banner, and wish for an eventual vote of no confidence against Kemerskai's regime. Many believe that this would result in an openly socialist President-Marshal such as Astler and maybe even the end of the hated martial law."

Brawls in the streets are common between Sutail's fascists and ultranationalists against Rosewing's natives and monarchists.\n\n Supporters of Rosewing advocate for a monarchy, whether it be constitutional or autocratic. His support mostly comes from natives in the north, and his supporters claim that a monarchy will bring about the stability that the Republic never gave them. In addition, a strong monarchic leader would not be prone to the chaos of the National Republican Party, and would quickly be able to act on poverty and banditry in the North, which would be their main power base.\n\n Suntail is perhaps the more dangerous one. His supporters, originally banned years ago due to a series of anti-government terrorist attacks, known as the National Revolutionary Front, want to establish a Griffonian Republic, take Griffenheim, and destroy the old vestiges of monarchy. But instead of a democratic regime like Kemerskai, they want to establish a true national republic, in which the oligarchy is destroyed and wealth is given to the people, as long as they serve the state and Suntail.\n\n Suntail's ultranationalist, populist, and revanchist ideology may prove a danger to Rosewing's conservatism, and it is beginning to attract the lower classes. But can Rosewing use his veteranship and political connections among the natives and the northerners to secure power?"

An hour later, popular militas and Suntail's blackshirts marched on the military council, demanding the council surrender complete power to Suntail. The council conceded, and swore Suntail in as President and Supreme Leader of the Griffonian Republic. Suntail's policy is radical and dangerous. He supports a return to the Imperial dialect, and he views the language of the native Griffons and Ponies as barbaric. He supports full total mobilization and a lightning war against the Griffonian Empire, which will leave the nation in ashes. From this, he will begin to implement ultranationalist policies as the new leader of the Empire, and conquer all of Griffonia under the new order. His plans are radical, but we have faith that Suntail will be able to secure victory in these troubled times."

Rosewing's politics differ from the radical Suntail. He is a more conservative figure, loyal to the monarchies of old, such as the Duchy of Cloudbury, which he believes was and will be a better govrnment then Kemerskai's. Rosewing himself has sympathies toward constitutional monarchy, fighting in the Revolution of 978 and still harboring loyalty toward democracy and liberalism. Rosewing's economic policy? Much of the same of Kemerskai's. Strong, social-democratic development will be kept, and with a strong monarch, countryside raiding and banditry wil be annihilated.

This behavior is unacceptable, and must be stopped. However, there are two solutions to such a thing. Schnabel Sungider, a political idealist and one of Kemerskai's closest advisors, says that the military should be rebuilt and the rebellious commanders sacked, so that the military will be at the same standard of the Griffonian army. Heinrich Kingfeather, ever the pragmatist, has dismissed this, claiming that the best course of action is the swiftest, merely placating the generals and going on with the Republican regime like clockwork."

The celebration was complete with a professional band lended from Skyfall for an obscene price, its members sporting fancier suits than the Duke himself. When he reached the parliamentary building, a 21-gun salute was given by the military of the Duchy of Cloudbury.\n\n However, in the homes of most citizens, the atmosphere was very different. The people of the Republic showed disbelief and skepticism. Years after the revolution had been brought north, and Duke Otto Plumenjar was lynched along with his wife Freja, the monarchy was being restored again. Trumpets blared and griffon soldiers paraded across the streets, but there was only a small amount of applause from the crowd, and even those who applauded cared little for the new monarchy. It would take time for the people to grow accustomed to this new regime, a regime that seemed to defy everything the Republic was built on.\n\nIn a speech to the local populace, Duke Oskar emphasized the need to "bring back the idea of a monarchy into the hearts and minds of these corrupted Griffons", and claimed that "the Republican Revolution was the greatest disaster to ever behold Griffonia, and left this land in complete anarchy. It was no doubt the gravest event in the last century." Republican leader Heinrich Kingfeather, in exile in the Kingdom of Vedina, wrote Oskar a strongly worded letter, telling him to "get his inbred group of goats out of this nation before the people lynch you like they did your bastard father"."

In a radio adress to the people, Kemerskai emphasized that the nation would return to civilian rule after the Imperial threat was contained, but also claimed he would not attack the Empire directly, saying that would be "suicide". Given that Kemerskai's emergency both lasts until the Imperial threat is contained but also given that he does not plan to attack the Imperials directly, it appears that the emergency will be almost indefinite."

Kogchel and Astler also made alliances with Erich Mühschnabel and Cyrusval university, a radical but quite "armchair" group of socialists.

In his adress, Sunglider viciously mocked the Equestrian monarchy for its autocratic nature, where two ponies ruled over all of Equestria, and were seen as gods. He then compared this to the system of divine right which the Griffonian Empire used to justify its legitimacy. In Sunglider's eyes, these two monarchies were one and the same - they were both despotic empires that used religious undertones to convince the people into supporting them.\n\nSunglider's new plan, harmony with republican characteristics, would solve this by implementing "true democracy". The constitution would guarantee the right to both free national elections and decentralized local elections, in which Griffons would be able to influence local policy. Direct rule from Canterlot, he said, is a foolish system, and true harmony needs a decentralized state tailored to different regions. Policy from Angriver to Skynavia would be much different, and local representatives would have significant sway on the government. This decentralized, democratic harmony will surely form the new basis of Sunglider's presiential platform."

Any griffon should be able to start their own business and achieve their own dream, but in recent years, this has been solely lacking, and poverty has only increased. To rectify this, we must continue welfare programs and tax cuts on former Griffonian peasants, ensuring them a living wage and a life free from the poverty the Imperials imposed on them. To pay for these ambitious new social programs, we will hike taxes on the former nobles of the lands, and conduct land reform and even seizure on underworked lands controlled by Griffonian oligarchs. Only then can we liberate our people, and truly achieve prosperity for all griffons."

Socialists believe that the NRP's principle of prosperity is incompatible with the conservative wing of the party, while the conservatives believe the socialists are undermining the principle of liberty with their anti-free market stance. With harmonists and democrats mostly in the middle, they have tried hard to mend the divide and assure both sides that the values of the Republic are being protected, but to no avail. Sometimes, parliament members even brawled with their fellow partymen due to conflicts in economic stances! With the climate growing more polarized by the day, we risk a splinter wing forming off the NRP, and undermining our legitimacy.

No. He will not stand and watch as dictatorships still rule in Griffonia. Now that he has the resources to attack the monarchies of the land, he will do so, and the brave Republican people will march on in pursuit of the three principles.

Within our nation, socialists strike at our decade-old democracy, disregarding the principle of liberty with their beliefs in broad nationalizations and destruction of our free market, capitalist system. Their policies would no doubt collapse our economy and weaken our democracy, allowing their smily, charismatic leaders to sully our Republic and abolish republican rule under the false pretense of "restoring order".

However, conservative economists in the government of Heinrich Kingfeather predict that our nation will fall into economic collapse with too much welfare spending, and that interest rates on Griffonian currency across the nation will spike! We cannot have this, and must roll back welfare reforms, instead relying on the meritocratic forces on the free market, which would ensure that griffons all had a chance to achieve as much wealth as possible. There will be no more burdensome regulations on the people of the Republic, nor welfare programs that condemn griffons to lives of decadence as they scrounge off government benefits. No!

This faction, after finding themselves independent from the most powerful political party in all of Griffonia, initially splintered into many different warring factions. Eventually, days later, Rikard Astler formed the Socialist Party of Griffonia, uniting syndicalists, democratic socialists, and even disaffected social democrats in a large, big-tent, socialist party. With socialists purged from the party, the NRP has shifted to the right, and it will be much easier for us to pass our capitalist reforms. With a legal opposition, we can also begin further democratization of the Republic. The creation of a socialist opposition will be a stepping stone to the eventual building of a multi-party system."

 griffonRepublic.224.d:0 "In a stunning move by President Heinrich Kingfeather, the local governments of the Heartlands have had significant power taken from them. Before the centralization measures, the parliaments of the Hearlands had striking amounts of power, and were delegated large amounts of autonomy. Parliaments in Angriver, the remnants of war-torn Katerin, and Feathisia, due to the large amount of Republicanism in those areas, were able to influence policy in their provinces, and often overruled federal projects and plans for the area. Our government in Griffenheim had to go through so much bureaucracy of local parliaments that we could not even get a simple public works project through the Feathisian government. Thankfully, Kingfeather has reformed these archaic institutions, and weakened these parliaments so they will no longer be a thorn in the side of the Griffenheim government.

 griffonRepublic.225.d:0 "The first pan-griffonian elections have been the most contented in the history of the Republic - with parties other than the National Republican Party allowed to participate, many candidates have created new parties and cast their lot in to become the next President of the Republic.\n\nThe most left-wing groups have attracted major support from labor unions, workers, and the unemployed. With a democratic socialist policy, they advocate for major welfare reforms, expansion of cooperatives, and industrial democracy. Rikard Astler espouses these same values while being a member of the NRP, but there is also Gerben Kogchel - whose life in the Grand Duchy of Feathisia has given him a devotion to democratic values, though his connections with anarchists and revolutionary socialists during the Empire's regency crisis have not been overlooked.\n\nThe social democrats, led by Genevieve Guildedwing, a Skyfall-based social democrat and populist, have also gained critical support from the workers. Her experiences with the unregulated capitalism of Skyfall's oligarchy will make her a candidate who understands the plight of the common folk. She will no doubt establish progressive taxes and transform the Republic into a welfare state, although if she is already ruling Skyfall, there is a low chance she will actually come close to the presidency.\n\nThe Center-NRP is led by Theodore Verany and Schnabel Sunglider, both griffons very similar to the President-Marshal. An Aquiliean revolutionary who fought in multiple revolutions against the corrupt Discret dynasty, Verany is dedicated to the principles of republicanism and harmony, and Schnabel the famed general and idealist of the Republic, is perhaps as well-renowned. \n\nOf course, there are always those of the capitalist parties and the Right-NRP. Gallo Ventriglio, a Wingbardian liberal and capitalist, who is a major proponent of laissez-faire economics and friendship with Equestria, has taken a stand as a prominent liberal-democrat, while Heinrich Kingfeather, a member of the Right-NRP, has staunchly aligned himself with Gallo's new movement.\n\nThe final group of candidates, the Militarists, are led by Kemerskai's own son, Alexander Kemerskai Jr., a staunch Republican. Alexander supports centralizing the Republic, strengthening the positions of the president, and making sure that the government is efficient and populist. Opponents say his government would be dictatorial, though he laughs off those accusations."

Schnabel Sunglider, despite his commitment to democratic principles and Republican unity, has demanded we enact justice against the young emperor, for "the unforgivable crimes of his father and the crimes him and his vile regent plotted to commit across all Griffonia."

Heinrich Kingfeather, ever the pragmatist, has declared that Grover VI must be liberated as a citizen of the Republic, to show that we are "better than the corrupt and twisted ways of the Imperials". Kingfeather's proposal would see the emperor stripped of his titles so he and his lineage would bear no threat to the Republic, although another option has arisen - Erich Kreiger, a Republican industrialist and conservative, has suggested we simply send Grover VI to Equestria - they would likely not use him as a political asset and teach him in the ways of friendship and harmony.\n\n After a heated debate between proponents of Kreiger's exile plan and proponents of giving the young Grover citizenship, the final verdict was reached..."

Such a solution would be as unjust as it would be asbsurd, and ironically it seems that the solution lies within a monarchy, or rather a diarchy.\n\nThe nation of Equestria has come to our aid, offering to shelter the young griffon. They will give him a new home, education and - hopefully - a new purpose in his life. It would be an adequate dumping ground for the prince, and Equestria has - for all its political failings - a reliable enough diplomatic standing that we can most likely trust them to not use him against us.\n\nAs young Grover is escorted down to the docks, where a ship is waiting for him, the old adage that "a compromise leaves everyone equally unhappy" comes to mind. The hardliners sees it as betraying the republican cause, the remaining monarchists sees it as another atrocity. Still, none will be too mad about it, and it will give the republic time to prove itself. Even if Grover returns in twenty or so years, he will return to a changed Griffonia. "

 griffonRepublic.256.d:0 "Cornelius Vinke, the mad writer of Bleakspire, had been holed up in the city hall of Bleakspire for weeks, gathering thousands of republicans from across the region and in the city itself, in a last-ditch, misguided fight against Kemerskai's regime. Now, however, the madgriff's luck was up.\n\nTanks and infantry rolled through the dead streets of Bleakspire, the population fearfully hiding within their homes and the rebels hiding within their bastions. Word had spread of Kemerskai's purges, and more and more viewed him as a tyrant and an autocrat - he was feared, but he was certainly not loved either, that much was certain. No pomp and circumstance greeted Kemerskai's batallions this time, and some citizens even jeered at the soldiers of the Republic as they marched towards the city council, ready to put an end to Vinke's heresy.\n\nIt was a short battle. Vinke's forces shattered at the prescence of real military veterans, and the griffon himself was barely alive at the end of the ordeal, his body battered with bruises as he flung himself at each Republican "traitor". The unconscious griffon was treated and sent to Cloudbury, where he awaited the justice of the Gods and the President-Marshal.\n\nCornelius Vinke was defiant util the last, cursing the "false Republic" and its "Maarite crypto-monarchist leader" until he was finally brought up to the gallows, where his eyes grew wide at the site of his certain doom. Kemerskai and Sunglider were in the crowd, watching as the life of one of the Republic's greatest griffons was shattered in front of their eyes.\n\n"This is your fault, President," the ever-faithful Sunglider spat, meeting the President-Marshal with his one-eyed gaze, "His life was not yours to take. He penned countless works in favor of our Republic, helped gather support against the Duchy, built the foundations of our democracy, and yet you killed him all the same."\n\nKemerskai stared at him and sighed. "It was my duty. He was a traitor who rebelled against his President, and subverted his Republic."\n\n"Everything he did was for the Principles of the National Republican Party. The same cannot be said for you, my brother."\n\n And with that, Sunglider walked away, and Kemerskai was left alone, sheer fury in his eyes, in front of the lifeless corpse of Cornelius Vinke."

Kemerskai groaned, beckoning for his only son to come forward and hear him, "This will be my final gift to you my son, your inheritance... Take what this fool has learned and do it right... I lived thirty years of my life as a hero but all will remember me as a tyrant..."\n\nHe struggled to get the words out, gasping with pain and crying in shame.\n\n"All I did... I did for stability, for the Republic, for our future... You have to restore democracy, as I should have done... Do not die a tyrant as I have." Kemerskai squeezed his claw into his son's, tears on both of their faces, "Remember Alex. Liberty, democracy, prosperity."\n\n"I'm off to see Boreas... Oh, and Alex..." He said, looking to his son with fear.\n\n "Yes father? What is it..." Alexander stated, gripping his father's claws tightly.\n\n "Remember me for the good that I did, not the bad. Please..."\n\n "Of course I will, I love you dad..." Alexander told him, and Kemerskai simply smiled and closed his eyes, falling into a peaceful sleep.\n\n He was pronounced dead within the next few days, but by that point, he was only a figurehead - all his power had been transferred to his son.\n\n As Alex left the hospital with the power of the President-Marshal, Kemerskai Jr. had two choices - shall he restore democracy as his father advised him too? Or keep the national emergency for the good of stability and power?"

As griffons debated, three choices had become frontrunners.\n\n"The Tricolour" is the party anthem of the NRP, and many claim that integrating it as our national anthem would increase party unity and show the people of Griffonia that we are still devoted to Republican causes. However, using the anthem of the NRP for the national anthem could be viewed as an attack by many small parties that have begun to form in parliament. Even without its political undertones, "The Tricolour" is still a divisive anthem - it's chorus, "Though cowards flinch and traitors sneer, we'll keep the tricolour flying here," has been viewed as offensive and crass. However, it still stands as one of the most popular unofficial anthems and is a staunch Republican tune.\n\nThe next song in consideration is "Risen From Ruins," a tune popularized during the Republican Revolution itself, that speaks of a united, free Griffonia. While "The Tricolour" speaks of Republicanism in general, "Risen From Ruins" speaks of our final goal. "Let us serve your good weal truly, Griffonia, our fatherland."\n\nThe last song for consideration is "Unity and Justice and Freedom", the third stanza of the popular Griffonian song "Das Lied der Griffonien", also called "Song of the Griffons". Our democratic values and our views for a united Griffonia are echoed in every word of this third stanza. In addition, picking a song that has already been popularized among the people of Griffonia may prove a boon to our legitimacy as the rightful successor to the dying Empire.\n\nIn the end however, which song shall be chosen?"

He is not befitting of such a high honour."\n\nUnfortunately, he was not soft enough, and Mach stood up from his chair, pointing at the Feathisian, "I would not tolerate this Frogeater in any National Republic. He is pompous, lazy, and inferior, all Herzlanders know that!"\n\n"The same to you, you disgusting peasant!" Hereen screeched at Mach, rising from his chair, "Suntail, this griffon is nothing but a fraud, acting for his own good. I have written novels, I have penned stories of the glorious national rejuvination, while this griffon is only an upjumped peasant!"\n\n"Say that again, you pompous snob!" Deitrich stood up to match Heeren, and spat at him, "Give me one reason why I shouldn't shoot you right now, you damned swamp Herzlander!"\n\nAt that moment, Suntail rose with the two griffons, and spoke.\n\n"You wouldn't want to do that, friend. In fact, Heeren is already leaving."\n\nThe Feathisian attempted to speak out a response, but Suntail's guards had already escorted him from the room when he found the words he wanted to say.\n\n"Do not take his departure personally, Mr. Mach. In fact, I have already planned for him to suffer an "accident" on the way back to De Vleugels, so that the two of us can find a more suitable governor for Feathisia.""

Erion XII suffered the same fate, although by a mob of trade unionists, not at the hands of the National Republicans.\n\nWith most of the Archons dead and the new ones just as bad, Suntail announced a new plan - one that would completely curtail the political power of the Archonate. They would no longer have the ability to influence the public of Griffonia at all, with encyclicals coming upon strict censorship by Suntail's NRIF to make sure it was not peddling inaccurate information. Archons and prelates would not be allowed to hold political office, and many temples not in use would be demolished for recreation or for industrial purposes. \n\nAny Archon subject to treason against the Republic would be tried and replaced with another one, who would hopefully learn not to speak out against the President-Marshal, and the same would go for even the lowliest prelate.\n\nAlthough many have condemned this decree as being tyrannical, the true defenders of the National Republic recognize the necessary measures of control on the traitorous Archonate."

[Root.GetLeader] has spoken with his advisors about the greatest course of action to integrate the remnants of the old Empire, and almost every one has suggested leaving Grover VI as monarch of at least the Kingdom of the Heartlands, binding Cloudbury to the already popular Grover dynasty.\n\nWith that, the Dual Monarchy of Cloudbury and Herzland was formed, with Oskar I taking control over everything north of the Herzland and Grover VI ruling over the Herzland proper, in mostly the same fashion of his old regime. Grover VI's loyalty to the Dual Monarchy was clenched by a two-pronged offer - Grover VI would accept the marriage of Ophelia Plumenjar, the grand-niece of Oskar I and great-granddaughter of Otto II, who perished in 978, while through the Plumenjar line of succession, Grover and Ophelia's child would eventually assume the line of both monarchs.\n\nWith the issue of loyalty and hereditary customs dealt with, the Council for the Establishment of the Dual Monarchy, led by [Root.GetLeader] himself, then decided on the administrative priveleges of each monarchy and their legislatures. Both Cloudbury and Griffenheim would be capitals of the Dual Monarchy, and while Cloudbury would be the ceremonial, de-facto capital, Griffenheim would be the capital where most administrative duties were to be held, such as sittings of the joint parliament, although most legislative duties would be confined to the monarchies themselves, which have a staggering amount of autonomy in the Dual Monarchy as a nation.\n\nParliamentary elections for both the Herzland and Cloudbury parliaments were promised, although the level of democracy and the actual parties allowed in these parliaments would essentially be subject to the monarchies themselves - so the old Cloudburian and Herzlander systems were left largely intact. Of course, although recieved by many of the ruling class to be an excellent decision, the Dual Monarchy was criticized passionately in the newspapers and radios of the Republic. Republican commentators of the banned National Republican Party declared it a move towards true reactionary politics of the old Empire, while many constitutional monarchists spoke in hushed voices about the possible takeover by Cloudbury by the Imperial monarchy.

I wish I could shed a tear, my brothers, but the truth is, Grover V has done nothing for the Heartlands but drive it into doom and despair. I'm sure many of you would agree that Grover V has done almost nothing right - he has let Katerin burn, strengthened the powers of the Archon, centralizing religious control over the capital and ending any hope of a secular Griffonia. He has spit in the face of every constitutional reform that he has been offered, even with the threat of a Second Griffonian Revolution on his doorstep.\n\nHe has lost the Eastern marches, leading them to continue their genocidal crusades on the ponies, and lost the Duchy of Griffonstone to a weak Regency Council under a griffon so old he is called "Grandpa"! He didn't even die right! He left the Empire in such chaos I'm almost inclined to cheer at his death. His son is not even six years old, and it is likely that a regency council of nobles, oligarchic and corrupt, will rule in his stead.\n\nAs much as it pains to say it, this is a victory for the Republic.

The nobility spent lavishly and began to gain more and more wealth and power while the people suffered, and the army began to mistrust the Emperor, especially a clique led by Kemerskai, Suntail, and Rosewing, among many other officers. One fateful day in February 978, peasants and workers seized the streets of Griffenheim, battling with guardsmen and storming houses and prisons. Every prisoner in the Imperial Cells was let out, and the people soon began to march upon the Imperial Palace. Kemerskai and many other imperial officers who had participated in an army-wide mutiny, along with hundreds and hundreds of commoners, stood at the gates of the seat of Imperial power and their government. In pure decentralized chaos, a wave of commoners rushed through the palace, trampling antique carpets, throwing artifacts to the ground and breaking the stained-glass windows of the Archonate.\n\n However, none of the commoners could find Grover V, despite Kemerskai's best efforts to look for him. According to Republican reports, he was whisked away by Eros at the last minute. However, the commoners and military did find the entire regency council, save for Eros and the emperor, of course. Some were put on a mock trial which always resulted in their executions, others were simply brutally mauled in the streets, others attempted to fight their way through the commoners. The regency council lost their power in the capital, an their deaths were cheered by thousands of griffons in the crowds. The people soon rallied behind the army mutineers and the National Republican Party, who formed the Griffonian Republic."

Kemerskai himself would take Interriver, at the Griffking River, where the Baron of Vinnin, his father, still reigned.

General Kemerskai had his first chance to prove his tactics as the new Marshal of the Republic and provisional President. The victory was decisive, and Count Jonas's forces were beaten back to the North, where after further confrontation with Republican forces, eventually fled into Bronzehill and left fighting entirely. Kemerskai's forces were able to utilize the River to their advantage, and Count Jonas, a poor strategist, led his troops cross the river, where they were gunned down by Republican cannons and artillery and forced to retreat, only killing a small amount of Republican troops.\n\n Hardweiler would eventually have been revealed to be raving drunk during the battle, believing that the Republicans were a mass of peasants and would never resort to real tactics.

This new state, the Peasant's Republic of Interriver, was almost socialist in nature, distributing wealth and power among themselves and organizing themselves into communes.

Kemreskai, however, utilized defensive tactics and artillery barrages, which he became famous for, and eviscerated his father's forces while on the defense. Thousands of griffons died in the attack on Kemerskai's fallback line, and when Kemerskai's forces counterattacked, the Baron's numerically superior force was driven back into the city itself.\n\nAldus's forces surrendered, and he was taken prisoner by his son. Along with his foremost officers (troops were given the option to join the Republic, those that refused were simply killed), he was taken to the city square of Vinnin, where he had once announced the Emperor's decrees and executions of his own. Now, the tides had turned, and Aldus was sentenced to death for the charges of treason against the people and peasants of Griffonia. The Baron of Vinnin, betrayed by his own son, was enraged, and seethed at Kemerskai for his last words, before he was executed by his child's headsman.\n\nThe Republic was now in control of all of Interriver, and with Suntail and Rosewing's campaigns in the East, South, and North succeeding, it seemed as if the Republic was about to secure the entire Griffenheim area in its own right, with many forces already moving into Katerin and Angriver in the South, where Republican support was high."

The elections were dominated by the National Republican Party, led by Kemerskai, but there were many others, such as the Socialist People's Party, led by the young and idealistic revolutionary Asper Sickleclaw, which advocated for socialism and revolutionary practice and ideology. Elections were also contested by revolutionary right-wing organizations, such as the National Revolutionary Front, led by the now-dead Peter Alstrenner, which advocated for staunch anti-monarchism, fanatic nationalism and pan-griffonian identity, along with a corporatist economic system.\n\nTo no-one's suprise, Kemerskai won with 77% of the vote, with Sickleclaw and Alstrenner both recieving under 15% of the vote. The NRP's unitary rhetoric, democratic principles, and the fact that the revolution was still ongoing and the people wanted stability, gave them an easy ride to victory. Kemerkai's experience as a war hero made him a very popular candidate, and his cabinet was generally built on compromise between moderate factions. It included army generals, idealists, pragmatists, all united under democratic cause and purpose. At least, in theory.\n\nKemerskai's first 100 days were suprisingly stable, as the Griffonian counter-revolutionaries still were licking their wounds in Bronzehill and Strawberry and did not undergo major attacks against the Republic during that time. To appease the workers, peasants, and other disaffected citizens, Kemerskai immeadiately began to implement large-scale reforms. The first act of his government was to remove any lingering positions of slavery, serfdom, and servitude in the Empire, freeing all who would fall under those positions, even when many of those tactics were not practiced any more by the Empire. Kemerskai improved welfare reforms for common griffons, establishing industrial changes such as minimum wage laws and steep taxation of Griffonian nobles and oligarchs to redistribute wealth to the common griffon. His policies were massively popular, and Kemerskai's approval ratings soared. However, Kemerskai's government did find trouble with inflation, with his economists often focused more on welfare policies than balancing the budget, leading to the printing of massive amounts of idols to satisfy Kemerskai's lofty ambitions\n\nFor now, at least, Griffonia was free."

While Otto II believed this would quell Republican tension, it did not, and Kloborg openly declared for Kemerskai's rebellion, giving his troops arms, supplies, food, and rest. Karl Svens-Rinner and his protege Tobias Sivenhof, who would later become a prominent Republican minister, became the leaders of the pro-Republican movement in Cloudbury, and would inspire numerous peasant revolts and attacks across the country after their declaration for Kemerskai.\n\nDespite Republican belief that the Cloudburians would fall easily, the war in the North raged on, and in the winter of 979, the Republicans were forced to hold the southern provinces of Cloudbury, which included most of the province of Winghagen (except the city itself, which was engaged in a brutal siege by Republican forces). The Cloudburian navy was still stationed in the Winghagen city-port, and would gather resources for the seiged city by buying goods from Vedina and the Imperials. The Imperial army, interestingly enough, had not attacked the Republicans from the South, focusing more on quelling internal resistance and saving what little territory they had left after the numerous independence declarations by Imperial vassals. It seemed the Republicans were in for a long war, with the seige of Winghagen ongoing and Cloudbury only a dream of spring.\n\nWhile the Republicans believed they could not take Winghagen, the tide soon changed in their advantage, when the arrival of a small flotilla under Hermann and Cornelius Hassentelf, Republican naval officers from a small Feathisian noble family turned the tide of the siege. The Hassentelf brothers crushed the Cloudburian fleet, which was completely unaware of any major Imperial naval presence. With the Cloudburian fleet destroyed, Winghagen quickly surrendered to the Republicans. Count Leonhard Gørtz himself brought the letter of surrender to General Claus Rosewing, but this did not save him. For his actions against the Griffonian Republic and the revolution, he was hanged as a traitor just hours after his surrender."

When the Republicans began the long march north, one of the first towns they came upon was Kloborg. Sivenhof pursuaded the mayor of the city, Karl Rinner, to support the Republican movement. Kloborg began to be used as one of the most important Republican strongholds, and for his support in the Long March, Sivenhof became the first senator of Doendejord. Sivenhof's policies were built on compromise, and he begame a very popular figurehead in the Republic."

 FAT_political_3_desc:0 "Rikard Astler, a staunch member of the Socialist NRP, was born in Cloudbury when it was under the control of the Republic, one of the only ministers in Kemerskai's government to have not fought in the Long March nor the Revolution. As a teenager, he began to support Skynavian socialist movements, but he relented after his father got a promotion to a prestigious government position and could not leave with him, not wanting to leave his family alone. He has been known for his more radical ideas, supporting councils of workers and peasants and asking the Republic to fully recognize the government of Skynavia. His proximity to the working class of the Republic and his lack of war fervour and nationalism have allowed him to secure a seat as the Republic's minister of industry."
 FAT_political_2:0 "Erich Kreiger"
 FAT_political_2_desc:0 "Erich Kreiger, born in the Peasant's Republic of Greifenmarschen, was always attracted to republican ideals and rhetoric. He found the peasant's republic, however, severely lacking, as it was a puppet to the monarchists in Griffenheim, and was too weak to get anything substantial done. He joined the Republicans soon after. His experiences in Greifenmarschen have given him skepticism for a decentralized state. Because of this, he joined the right wing of the NRP, believing that a strong government would solve the problems of banditry. Krieger's experience allowed him to become the minister of armaments and war, but he has been criticized by natives for his inability to speak Cloudburian."
 FAT_political_4:0 "Cornelius Vinke"
 FAT_political_4_desc:0 "A prolific Republican author, Vinke was born in Fezera. He became famous for his provocative writings, and was eventually exiled from Skyfall for "disturbing the peace" after a particularly violent Republican rally. He found himself in Feathisia, where he joined the National Republican Army. After the march, he became more and more reclusive, and eventually disappeared from public eye entirely, holing himself up in his house on the Vedinan border. He continues to write, but his style becomes more and more confusing, and his writings more and more cryptic. Some of his newer books have sold exceptionally well, such as one criticizing the monarchy of Equestria called "The Lie of Harmonic Monarchy". However, some of his published works have been downright insane, such as one book where he claimed "In the end, the goats will return, and ally with Maar to end our race.""
 FAT_political_6:0 "Reinhard Suntail"
 FAT_political_6_desc:0 "Described by many as the "second most powerful griffon in the republic", Reinhard Suntail was one of Kemerskai's most trusted generals during the Griffonian Revolution. A brutal man, Suntail's ideology is driven by vengeance and hatred towards the Griffonian Empire and its political system, which he calls "decadent" and "oligrachic". Suntail's relationship with Kemerskai was broken when Kemerksai banned the Griffonian National Revolutionary Front, an organization Suntail was a member of, which advocated for ultranationalism and pan-Griffonian politics. For years, Suntail has led an autonomous army in the countryside, beginning a campaign of banditry against armories, towns, and farms in the region, contributing to the unruly army that threatens the republic. With enough concessions, however, the most dangerous griffon in the Republic could eventually become one of Kemerskai's most trusted associates, willing to die for the Revolution."
 FAT_political_7:0 "Stefano Arivelli"
 FAT_political_7_desc:0 "Stefano Arivelli hails from the city of Karthin, in Wingbardy. After the death of King Gumberto in 972 ALB, his family moved to the Empire, where they were not welcome due to hostile attitudes toward Wingbardians. Stefano joined the army, but was consistently mocked for his Wingbardian upbringing, and found solace in the Republican, pan-griffonian movement developing in the region. Stefano would eventually participate in the Revolution and the Long March. However, he was unable to speak Cloduburian and only knew a small amount of the Herzlander dialect. While a banking expert from his time in the Wingbardian School of Economics, he has begun to drink and waste himself, fed up with his inability to interact with most of the Republic's people."
 FAT_political_8:0 "Olaf Restjen"
 FAT_political_8_desc:0 "Olaf, a native of Cloudbury and ever the pacifist, joined the Republic during the Long March. He was a prolific artist, and his art often carried pacifist and republican themes. When the NRP took over the Duchy, Olaf Restjen joined them, and became a popular figurehead for the Republic. He founded the Lostgate Academy of Art, and after that, was elevated to the first Senator of Lostgate. After 2 successful terms under the Harmonist wing of the NRP, he distanced himself from factionalism, disliking the current NRP-Harmonist leader, Schnabel Sunglider, who advocated for militant expansionism and armaments manufacturing to strike at the Empire. Olaf resigned from his position as senator and resigned to return to his life of painting. He was given the Medal of Honor from President-Marshal Kemerskai for his work in art, and continued to serve the Republican cause through his work."
 FAT_political_9:0 "Claus Rosewing"
 FAT_political_9_desc:0 "Claus Rosewing was once Kemerskai's most trusted friend in the battle against the Griffonian monarchy. Rosewing was born in 941 in the city of Griffing, Angriver, perhaps the most backward imperial province. From an early age, he witnessed the poverty common in that area of the Empire, and wondered why it occured.\n\n At the age of 24, he joined the Imperial Army, a couple years before Alexander Kemerskai. When Kemerskai joined the army, they developed a fast friendship, and began to discuss Republican and harmonic ideals. Rosewing, ever the pragmatist, disagreed with the regime of Grover V moreso than the concept of monarchy. He believed that in the right situation, a monarchy could possibly be reformed to suit harmonic ideals. They marched together on the Imperial Palace, and when Kemerskai assumed power, he appointed Rosewing as his second-in-command.\n\nRosewing eventually fled north with Kemerskai, and the two suffered many disagreements about Republican rhetoric and ideals, including Rosewing's sympathy for monarchy, leading Rosewing to be cast out as head general in favor of the ambitious Reinhard Suntail, who had ties to outright fascist groups. Rosewing, disilluisoned, took his army brigades and went North.\n\nEventually, Reinhard Suntail joined him, in an alliance of pure chance against the regime of Kemerskai. Rosewing's doubts about the Republican ideal manifested into full hatred, and he eventually abandoned the ideals of harmony altogether, idolizing military dictatorships and bandit states. Rosewing, however, never stooped to the level of Suntail's raiders, and always distributed raided wealth among his troops. He preffered to raid armories, and warned his soldiers against attacking towns, pronouncing the death penalty for any Republican officer who would do such a thing. Rosewing's style of banditry became popular among his soldiers, but whenever he looted the lands he once fought for, he turned sour, and he always thought back to the times he spent with Kemerskai."

He was sheltered by his mother in Griffenheim, and Kemerskai, fearful of losing them, arranged for them to take a boat from a recently-captured Feathisian port up to the peaceful Kingdom of Vedina. When Kemerskai eventually arrived at Cloudbury after his failed revolution, he asked for his son to come with him, and in 981 ALB, they were re-united, Alexander Jr. only 14.\n\nAlexander, like his father, joined the military once he became 18 and served with dignity, rising the ranks to become a general of the Republic, like his father before him."

 FAT_political_pragmatist_desc:0 "If you asked a Republican citizen what Heinrich Kingfeather, arguably the second most powerful griffon in the Republic, has done in the last 4 years, despite his vast agenda, they would be unable to tell you anything.\n\nHeinrich Kingfeather was born in 949 ALB in Greengate, Yale. Trained in law and economics, the young Kingfeather did not seem like a suitable candidate for a revoultionary leader at all, but his progressive legal precedents led him to become one of Republicanism's staunchest defenders. When the Revolution broke out in 978, Kingfeather was originally skeptical, but eventually joined Kemerskai once Griffenheim had been seized and the regency council driven out. As a lawyer and politician first and revolutionary second, Kingfeather advocated for Republicanism at the international level, attempting numerous deals with both Equestria and the River Coalition - both who largely denied his advances. His legal and political action during Kemerskai's term eased public instability and anger at the Republicans, but it could not save the revoultion militarily.\n\nKingfeather, instead of participating in the Long March, fled to Skyfall and then the newly independent City of Fezera, before finally arriving in the Republic to cheering crowds after its control over Cloudbury was secured. Although his inability to support the Republicans in the Long March was a point of disaproval for many, Kingfeather continued to represent the people of the Republic in their new seat in Cloudbury.\n\nKingfeather's work has largely been behind the scenes since he became Kemerskai's second-in-command in 1003, replacing ambitious militarist Schnabel Sunglider with a focus on largely domestic issues. Faced with an unruly military and banditry in the countryside, Kingfeather began to construct a policy that countered Sunglider's beliefs of violent reaction to dissidence. Kingfeather met with hundreds of native leaders in acts that helped mend the complete chaos in the countryside following Rosewing's initial agitation, acts that led him to become one of the most pro-native leaders on the national level. Pragmatism was Kingfeather's main goal, a goal that became more and more difficult with the polarization of the country between political and ethnic lines.\n\nWill he ever succeed? Or will he die with all the cards in his hands and no bravery to use them, as his opposition claims?"

While in the military, he joined the brigade of Artillerieoffizier Alexander Kemerskai, and he learned about harmony and republicanism. Immediately, he was drawn to the ideology, and began to delve into books about Equestria and Sicameon. Sunglider participated in the revolution, and served with honor and distinction in the National Republican Army. When he came to the north, he became active in politics, demanding a return to Griffenheim and the restoration of the supsended constiution. He became senator of Cloudbury, and then founded his own faction in the NRP - the Harmonist Caucus. With an almost fanatical devotion to the republic and harmony, Sunglider is an idealist and a militarist, things that make him one of the most dangerous griffons in Cloudbury."

### Leader Descriptions ###

 chadskai_desc:0 "Alexander Kemerskai was born in Vinnin, the third son of Baron Aldus Kemerskai. With too late a place in succession and too insignificant a griffon to truly become one of the nobility, Kemerskai tried many odd jobs - he played cornet in the Vinnin Orchestra and was a constant guest at every event in town - eventually, however, he joined the Imperial military. He rose to the ranks of Artillerieoffizier in the Imperial Army, and was set to have a promising career in the armed forces as a Marshal. But fate had different ideas for Griffonia.\n\nThe tumultuous years that preceded 978 have disillusioned Kemerskai of his loyalty to the Emperor. He could not stand seeing the decadent nobility leech of others' hard work, nor did he approve of the awful conditions the commonfolk were subjected towards. Thus, he began plotting with like-minded officers and made use of the brewing peasants' insurrection. After a particularly crass display of authority abuse from the Regency Council, the people had enough and stormed the Imperial Palace. In the confusion that followed, Kemerskai found his way as the leader of the newly proclaimed Griffonian Republic.\n\nBut this success was not meant to last. Although Kemerskai was popular and commanded respect, he could not control everygriff, and ruling the already weakened country became impossible. It did not take long for a reactionary movement to rise up and banish the republican supporters from the Heartlands. The long march began towards the northern reaches of the fractured Empire, where they have taken control of the region from nobles attempting to start their own independent nation.\n\nMany years have passed since those events, and yet Marshal Kemerskai's devotion to the republican cause has not wavered. Although even now he has to deal with unruly subordinates, he still holds all the cards in his claws. He is also a prolific author, and his many writings inspire republican movements across the entire Griffonia to follow his cause."
suntail_desc:0 "Reinhard Suntail was born in Crona, a province in the heart of the Griffonian Empire. His family was poor, and lived on scraps. Suntail, wanting to escape the dreary farmlands of Crona, joined the Imperial Army at the age of 15, and journeyed to the city of Griffenheim, where he was placed into the brigade of Alexander Kemerskkai, a renowned Artillerieoffizier in the Griffonian Empire and one of Grover's most promising generals.\n\nSuntail joined Kemerskai's plot to overthrow the empire, believing the monarchy of Griffonia was decadent, oligarchic, and drew upon the worst conditions of Griffonkind - greed and lust for power. Suntail participated in the battle for the Imperial Palace, and eventually found his way in command of an entire Republican batallion. With it, he went to his old hometown of Crona and engaged in a brutal looting campaign in an event which would be recalled as "The Rape of Crona" years later.\n\nWhen the revoultionaries began the long march north, Suntail began to doubt the harmonist values that Kemerskai was so dedicated to, and joined a new party - The Griffonian National Revolutionary Front, an ultranationalist organization dedicated to populism, republicanism, and fanatic devotion to the nation state and people. While Kemerskai did not trust Suntail, he was forced to make him the second most powerful griffon in the republic, and he became Kemerskai's top general.\n\nWhen the National Revolutionary Front was banned after a terrorist attack in Cloudbury in 1003, Suntail sent his army North, and began to loot, plunder, and sack both Republican and foreign strongholds for weapons and loot. He became a vicious bandit warlord, known for his sheer brutality against both harmonist and monarchist insitutions."
rosewing_desc:0 "Claus Rosewing, once Kemerskai's most trusted friend in the battle against reaction, was born in 941 in the city of Griffing, Angriver.\n\n At the age of 24, he joined the Imperial Army, and soon became a mentor and comrade to Kemerskai when he joined the army soon after. They both were staunch supporters of Grover IV and his new reforms - but they also believed in radical republicanism and democracy. Rosewing, ever the pragmatist, believed that a regime like Grover IV's would make revolution unncessary - and that the people should only revolt when monarchy becomes oppressive and decadent. When Grover V took power, however, Rosewing became a supporter of revolution, participating in the mutiny of the Imperial Army during the March on the Imperial Palace. Rosewing participated in campaigns in Angriver and Katerin, and was appointed in late 978 as Kemerskai's offical vice president.\n\nRosewing eventually fled north with Kemerskai, but by that point, the two had suffered many disagreements about Republican rhetoric and ideals. In 995, Rosewing was soon removed as Chief of Staff and Vice President - for Vice President, Kemerskai appointed Schnabel Sunglier, a staunch Republican, and for Minister of Defense, Reinhard Suntail, an openly far-right but skilled general.\n\nRosewing was sent North to keep the peace with a sizable force, but instead of keeping the peace, Rosewing began to undermine it. His warlord band soon built connections with native and monarchist groups, and Rosewing engaged in the looting of Republican armies and stockpiles. However, Rosewing was not fully anti-government, and always made sure never to attack towns - any soldier who did so would recieve the death penalty. And there, in the north, Rosewing has stayed, "defending the peace" for 10 years and counting."
oskar_desc:0 "Oskar Plumenjar was never supposed to be duke of Cloudbury. Oskar was born to a commoner, August Plumenjar, in 956 ALB. When Kemerskai's revolution was brought north, and his distant relative, Otto II was executed by Kemerskai, the rest of the legitimate Plumenjar line was taken captive and eventually killed.\n\nWhile this prevented a takeover from monarchist forces, there were still Plumenjars who were alive. In 776 ALB, the infant Erik Plumenjar was betrayed by his great-uncle and regent Frederik, who took the throne for himself and disinherited Erik and any of his future offspring. Erik's line was legitimatized to save the House of Plumenjar, and August begame the leader of the house. August and Oskar, living in the Northern Tribes, a pony community north of Cloudbury, plotted a return to the throne of the Duchy.\n\nWhen August died in 1002 ALB, Oskar became head of the house. He is a quiet, well-mannered griffon, who was until now not interested in pursuing his claim. Oskar preffered to live a peaceful life in the Northern Tribes, developing friendships with the local ponies there and becoming officially bilingual.\n\nJust now, however, Oskar was restored to the throne by warlord Claus Rosewing, who declared him Oskar I of the Duchy of Cloudbury. The line of Plumenjar would continue, and Cloudbury would once again stand under monarchic rule!"
hafslund_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 30th of July, 973 in Bleakspire\n\n§YPolitical Affiliation§!: §RNRP-Left§!\n\nJonas Hafslund was born in the Duchy of Cloudbury in 973 ALB, but when the Republicans moved North to secure the Duchy, his parents turned coat, cheering the Republican army as they marched through the hills of Bleakspire. Hafslund followed suit, and when at the age of 18, he immeadiately enlisted in the Republican army - like many new recruits, he was attracted by the passionate speeches of the President-Marshal but also by new, young radicals such as Rikard Astler. Hafslund found himself supporting socialist ideals, and participated in many social-democratic and democratic socialist organizations while an officer.\n\nIn 998 ALB, at 25, Hafslund was elevated in rank yet again at the request of many councilors who believed him to be loyal to the Republican cause should large-scale disobedience occur. Hafslund, along with the young strategist Otto Gremmersen, became one of the key griffons of the Young Officer's Movement, loyal to social-democratic policy and revolutionary ideas - in sharp contrast to the old guard who had once been entrenched in the Griffonian army.\n\n While Hafslund is still a relatively mediocre general, he has certainly become one of the harbingers of a new movement in the Republic - which has put him at odds with many of his fellow generals..."
emerich_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 21st of January, 952 in Winterbell\n\n§YPolitical Affiliation§!: §MNRP-Democratic§!\n\nWalter Emerich was born to a family of merchants in Winterbell, Strawberry, and was expected to join the family business at the Griffing river. Emerich, however, had different plans for his destiny, and when he turned 16, he bid his parents farewell and took a steamboat down the Griffing to Griffenheim.\n\nCity life, however, was not what Emerich believed it to be - and he soon wished to be back in Strawberry. Disillusioned with the poverty and strife in the capital following the death of the popular Grover IV, Emerich became active in underground republican circles.\n\nWhen revolution broke out in 978, Emerich rejoiced, and participated in the storming of the Imperial palace along with thousands of commoners. Despite not having a shred of military experience, he was appointed as an officer by the President-Marshal for his actions in the storming of the palace, but most historians attest Kemerskai appointed him to ensure support among fanatic republicans - who still viewed him as an opportunist.\n\nEmerich learned quickly from his fellow officers, participating in the First and Second Interriver Campaigns - but was defeated at the Second Battle of Vinnin by Erich Ebonwing.\n\nEmerich would subsequently participate in the Long March and post-revolutionary politics, being appointed provisional senator of Brenna by Kemerskai, a position he holds to this day - although now he stands as a military governor, fanatically loyal to the Marshal who gave him a new life."

schnabel_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 12th of February, 959 in Griffenheim\n\n§YPolitical Affiliation§!: §MNRP-Democratic§!\n\nSchnabel Sunglider did not lose his eye in the service of his glorious Republic so that he could see it fall to limp-wristed conservatives, Skynavian-sympathizing democratic socialists, and vicious warlords. Vice-President of the Republic from 995 to 1003, and Chief of Staff from 1003 onwards, Schnabel Sunglider has been one of the staunchest supporters of the regime of Alexander Kemerskai and the democratic values that were promised by the revolution of 978.\n\nEver the idealist, Sunglider has fought for the rights of the people since he joined the National Republican Party in 975 ALB, becoming an unofficial leader of the party during his teenage years. From there, he rose to power in the revolution of 978 ALB, shaking claws with Marshal Kemerskai and together proclaiming the Griffonian Republic, along with generals Claus Rosewing and Reinhard Suntail. Sunglider fought with Reinhard Suntail in the Crona campaign, but took a bullet to the eye during the fighting. Whisked away by medics, Sunglider miraculously survived, but found Crona in ruins - Reinhard Suntail had sacked the city to the ground in vengeance for Imperial crimes and the percieved death of Sunglider.\n\nAlthough he never fully recovered from the loss of his eye, Sunglider kept fighting, and dissatisfied with Suntail, Sunglider fought with Kemerskai during his campaigns in the North with a fury that two-eyed griffons could barely match. A one-eyed phantom, Sunglider remained a battle-hardened tactician and fearsome general throughout his service in the Republican military.\n\nNow, Sunglider is in a prime position of power, and is ready to protect the Republican dream at any cost."
