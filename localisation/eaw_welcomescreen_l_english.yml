 EAW_WS_Northern_Equestria:0 "Northern Equestria"
 EAW_WS_Northern_Equestria_desc:0 "The Northern parts of the Equestrian continent are dominated by cold temperatures and mountainous terrain. Because of this, the region suffers from a deliberating lack of §YInfrastructure§!, making logistics a challenging task.\n\nThe countries in the North of Equestria are notably a lot weaker than their neighbours to the South. As such, northern nations require a substantial amount of buildup and time to launch a successful attack on the south.\n\nPolitically and economically, §YNova Griffonia§! starts out as the strongest nation in the North, though it is not quite a regional hegemon, and can be overpowered by other nations, depending on the choices made during the game.\n\nThe North has to worry most about their neighbours to the south, mainly §YStalliongrad§!, the §YChangelings§! and §YEquestria§!. Seeing as how the North lacks infrastructure and industrial capacity in comparison to the southern nations, they are very vulnerable to attacks from their more powerful neighbours. That said, the mountainous and harsh terrain of the North does favor the defender.\n\nIn conclusion, the North offers a region with challenging terrain and tough starting conditions, and one must bide their time and exploit their neighbours to make further expansion outside the region possible."
