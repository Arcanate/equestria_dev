Equestria was torn asunder, Baltimare had seceded from the nation of ponies, Stalliongrad had taken land that they believed to be theirs, and now it was Vanhoover's turn.\n\n\"Mayor Goldwin!" the admiral boomed as his pointstallions booted open the door, two taking up positions at the entrance, and waiting as guards. "Vanhoover is breaking free from Equestria, will you join us in the revolution for the workers?"\n\n"Are you mad, Admiral Hoover?" the mare responded with her brows furrowed, eyes flicking from marine to admiral, and back again.\n\n"That's a shame, Mayor, as the revolutionary leader of Vanhoover, I have no choice but to...""

Six ponies, five blanks, when the clock strikes the hour they would fire.\n\nGoldwin couldn't say she had a bad life, she'd served her city faithfully and true, they were just misguided is all, right? With time, Celestia and Equestria would bring the ponies back around to the ways of friendship, and harmony, and they'd punish the admiral and his ponies for their crimes.\n\n\"Rifles, ready!\" barked Dust Hoover, the traitor to his navy.
