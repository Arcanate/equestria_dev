vanhoover.1.t:0 "Fate of the Mayor"
vanhoover.1.d:0 "Dust Hoover entered through the Vanhoover city hall main doors, his loyal marines in tow. Now was the time for a revolution. Equestria was torn asunder, Baltimare had seceded from the nation of ponies, Stalliongrad had taken land that they believed to be theirs, and now it was Vanhoover's turn.\n\n\"Mayor Goldwin!" the admiral boomed as his pointstallions booted open the door, two taking up positions at the entrance, and waiting as guards. "Vanhoover is breaking free from Equestria, will you join us in the revolution for the workers?"\n\n"Are you mad, Admiral Hoover?" the mare responded with her brows furrowed, eyes flicking from marine to admiral, and back again.\n\n"That's a shame, Mayor, as the revolutionary leader of Vanhoover, I have no choice but to...""
vanhoover.1.a:0 ""...execute you as a traitor to the revolution."" #Real Communism
vanhoover.1.b:0 ""...place you under house arrest.""
vanhoover.1.c:0 ""...exile you in a fair trial.""

vanhoover.2.t:0 "Fate of the Mayor - An Execution"
vanhoover.2.d:0 "The proletariat of Vanhoover surrounded a hastily constructed stage, 6 ponies in a line with rifles ready up on top. All who were gathered knew why they were here, and that was to watch the final moments of former Mayor Goldwin, the Mayor of Vanhoover prior to independence from Equestria being seized by Dust Hoover. Six ponies, five blanks, when the clock strikes the hour they would fire.\n\nGoldwin couldn't say she had a bad life, she'd served her city faithfully and true, they were just misguided is all, right? With time, Celestia and Equestria would bring the ponies back around to the ways of friendship, and harmony, and they'd punish the admiral and his ponies for their crimes.\n\n\"Rifles, ready!\" barked Dust Hoover, the traitor to his navy. The clocktower ticked closer, and closer, all to when Dust and his cronies would take hold in Vanhoover."
vanhoover.2.a:0 "6 ponies, 5 blanks, 1 death."

vanhoover.3.t:0 "Fate of the Mayor - An Arrest"
vanhoover.3.d:0 ""For failing to assist the legal revolution and secession of the Vanhoover Commune from the grasps of Equestria and the bourgeoisie in control, you're being placed under house arrest. A personal guard will be assigned to you, to ensure that you do not attempt to escape your confinement," Admiral Hoover read off a prepared paper in a dull monotone, eyes flicking up to stare into the - now former - Mayor's own, before motioning to two of his marines, and having her removed from the building. This was his office now, and he'd make full use of it."
vanhoover.3.a:0 "Admiral Dust Hoover, revolutionary."

vanhoover.4.t:0 "Fate of the Mayor - An Exile"
vanhoover.4.d:0 ""You will be permitted to stay within Vanhoover, enjoying all privileges as a resident, with one exception," the admiral paused, before readying a pair of clippers. "You will never have a mane or a coat, to forever mark you as the outcast that went against the desires of the worker.""
vanhoover.4.a:0 "Bzzzzzz. Clip clip clip."
