 ### Events ###
 dawn.0.t:0 "A Brief History"
 dawn.0.d:0 "The Barony of Rumare, one of the cradles of Griffonian civilisation, considered by most as a paradise on earth, with it's sceneic beaches, beautiful landscapes, ancient architecture and storied history. This reputation as an idealic retreat has only been reiforced in the recent years as seemingly only Rumare was capable of avoiding the bloodshed and violence of the Empire's collapse. Rumare itself has been ruled for generations by the benevolent claws of the Dawnbreaker family, whom are matrilinearly descended from the Imperial family. The still recent death of Baron Recimir has shook the small country to the core, as his son Alaric has returned from his tour as a mercenary abroad and now intends to put into practice everything he has learnt abroad to drag Rumare into the modern age."
 dawn.0.a:0 "What a peaceful place"
 dawn.1.t:0 "The Direction of the Government"
 dawn.1.d:0 "While we are a rather small country, with the passing of Baron Recimir the new Baron, Alaric has decided to invite what few politicians we have in order to decide in which direction the government shall lead Rumare."
 dawn.1.a:0 "We must open up to the world"
 dawn.1.b:0 "Maintain the status quo"
 dawn.1.c:0 "We must defend our island to the last breath!"
 dawn.3.t:0 "Our Fate"
 dawn.3.d:0 "The truth is we are a small nation, we simply cannot hope to stay relevant nor survive in the current Griffonian political climate, thus we must find someone to protect us. Our advisors have suggested that we contact either what remains of the Griffonian Empire or ask Wingbardy to allow us to join the Karthinian Pact. What shall we do?"
 dawn.3.a:0 "I suppouse it's time to bend the knee"
 dawn.3.b:0 "The Wingbardians aren't that bad"
 dawn.3.c:0 "We don't need either of them"
 dawn.4.t:0 "The Shores of Rumare"
 dawn.4.d:0 "Recently we have been contacted by diplomats from the tiny Barony of Rumare, and from what they say it seems that the new Baron fearning for his little plot of land wishes to once more pledge allegiance to the Empire. What shall we do?"
 dawn.4.a:0 "Well this is a pleasant suprise"
 dawn.4.b:0 "Give them the cold shoulder"
 dawn.5.t:0 "The Shores of Rumare"
 dawn.5.d:0 "Recently we have been contacted by diplomats from the tiny Barony of Rumare, apparently Baron Dawnbreaker fearing for the safety of his nation and his subjects wishes to join the Karthinian Pact. What shall we do?"
 dawn.5.a:0 "Sure, let them join the Pact"
 dawn.5.b:0 "I never liked Rumare anyway"
 dawn.6.t:0 "Back Together Once More"
 dawn.6.d:0 "We've received news from our diplomats in Griffonia. It seems that the Regent has decided to allow us to rejoin the Empire as a vassal state once more."
 dawn.6.a:0 "That's nice"
 dawn.7.t:0 "The Cold Shoulder"
 dawn.7.d:0 "It seems that the Imperial Regent has decided to give us the cold shoulder and refused to permit us back into the Empire, perhaps we should ask the Wingbardians for help?"
 dawn.7.a:0 "Hopefully they'll let us into the Pact"
 dawn.7.b:0 "I refuse to grovel again, we're on our own"
 dawn.8.t:0 "An Offer From Rumare"
 dawn.8.d:0 "It seems that after receiving the cold shoulder from the Imperial Regent when he wished to rejoin the Empire Alaric Dawnbreaker, perhaps out of spite has sent a diplomat asking to allow Rumare to become a member of the Karthinian Pact."
 dawn.8.a:0 "Sure, why not, let them join"
 dawn.8.b:0 "They're on their own"
 dawn.9.t:0 "The Pact"
 dawn.9.d:0 "After some debate with their allies it seems that the Wingbardians have allowed us to join the Karthinian Pact."
 dawn.9.a:0 "Great!"
 dawn.10.t:0 "All Alone"
 dawn.10.d:0 "Despite the best efforts of our diplomatic corps we have failed to find allies in both Wingbardy and the Griffonian Empire, we are very much on our own."
 dawn.10.a:0 "We need new diplomats"
 dawn.11.t:0 "The Shores of Rumare"
 dawn.11.d:0 "It seems that after being scorned by the Wingbardians, Baron Dawnbreaker has decided to send a diplomat to the Imperial Capital in an effort to once more rejoin the Empire, perhaps we should overlook his brief stint with the Karthinian Pact."
 dawn.11.a:0 "Let them join the Empire, what's the worst that could happen?"
 dawn.11.b:0 "They're on their own"
 dawn.12.t:0 "The Baron's Offer"
 dawn.12.d:0 "We have received an interesting offer from the Baron of Rumare today, he is offering to buy the city of Residence, and the surrounding countryside for an amazingly large sum. A sum so large that it could return the entirety of Griffinstone back into prosperity once more. What shall we do?"
 dawn.12.a:0 "It's a deal!"
 dawn.12.b:0 "Residence is not for sale"
 dawn.13.t:0 "Griffinstone Accepts"
 dawn.13.d:0 "After some negotiating the Lords of Griffinstone have decided to accept our deal, thus we are now the proud owners of Residence. Unfortunately this little purchase has cost us practically our entire treasury, and it might take months if not years for us to recover financially."
 dawn.13.a:0 "Great!"
 dawn.14.t:0 "Griffinstone Refuses"
 dawn.14.d:0 "It seems that despite the best efforts of our diplomats, merchants and the Baron himself the Lords of Griffinstone have refused to sell Residence to us, thus denying us our ancient rights to the land. What shall we do?"
 dawn.14.a:0 "To Tartarus with it! The field of battle will settle this!"
 dawn.14.b:0 "We will bide our time..."
 dawn.14.c:0 "I never wanted Residence anyway..."
