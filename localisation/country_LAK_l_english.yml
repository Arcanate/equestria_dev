 LAK_dying_culture:0 "Ruiniad"
 LAK_dying_culture_desc:0 "Ruiniad or the Ruination is a term coined by Rumarean scholars to describe the gradual decline of the Rumarean language, culture and traditions.\n\nNo griffon is quite certain how or when it started, but the cultures more predominant in the Griffonian Empire have started to eclipse the native traditions. Some theorized this is due to immigration and simple convenience in international trade.  Regardless of the cause, the numbers speak for themselves, as barely 30% of Rumare's population still speak their native language. Even the most optimistic academics predict it is but matter of time until our culture goes truly extinct and the Ruiniad is complete."

 LAK_realpolitik_desc:0 "While we have decided we must restore our nation we have not quite decided how to do that yet. While avid nationalists wish to go on a crusade to reclaim our land, more pragmatic Griffons at court would have us bide our time for when the moment may be more suited, and possibly join a greater power in order to get back our birthright."
 LAK_subisides_families:0 "Encourage Large Families"
 LAK_subisides_families_desc:0 "One of the causes of Rumarean decline was the simple fact there were not enough Rumarean Griffons.

Since unlike the Imperials the Aquelians or the Wingbardians, we have no outstanding cultural battles with others around us, or at least we lost the ones we started...

 LAK_the_free_rumare_army:0 "Byddin Rhyddid o Rumare"
 LAK_the_free_rumare_army_desc:0 "The response to the Baron's call have been at the very least shocking.

 LAK_superior_desc:0 "We shall defend our island against any and all invaders, by overwhelming them with firepower. Our cannon fire will be so strong in volume that it will blot out the sun from the sky, invisible for the shells that we launch at our enemies.

 LAK_expand_airports:0 "Expand Our Airfields"

 LAK_radar:0 "RADAR Technology"
 LAK_radar_desc:0 "Capable of tracking an airplane long before visible contact, RADAR may be cutting edge technology, but we would be foolish not to make use of it. The Baron has already ordered us to begin development of our own RADAR systems, and as such, we must hurry to finalize designs."
 
 LAK_naval_base:0 "Establish the RN"
 LAK_naval_base_desc:0 "We must make strides to modernize our small fledgling navy. With onset war coming on the horizon, we need a good way to defend our lake, making it impossible to cross by enemy forces. Establishing a Modern Rumaran Navy is an excellent first step in this process."
 LAK_flexible_navy:0 "A Small Fleet"
 LAK_flexible_navy_desc:0 "Because our Lake itself is quite small, our navy as well should match it, as we have no need for massive battleships and outdated battlecruisers.

 LAK_submarines:0 "Lake Sharks"

 ### Events ###
 dawn.1.t:0 "The New Baron"
 dawn.1.d:0 "Alaric paced back and forth on the deck of the small boat crossing the misty lake. His father was dead and he must return home to take charge of Rumare himself. His income as A mercenary had been one of the primary sources of income for Rumare and had acBaroned for 26% of total revenue marked as *Birthday Gifts* in the Barony's ledger. But that was not the only thing that worried him. For he was in outlaw in Griffonstone, and he was on the edge of legal status in Arantiga from which he had taken this boat. And it took the last coins in his pocket to get a port guard to look the other way.\n\nBut at last he saw something, a shape, a ship is taking form on the horizon... he readied his weapon but soon saw something unusual, the ship simply threw down a rope, of which his transport tied to their bow, and then began to slip into the haze. He was safe now. But now the question of how to rule...\n\nHis father had always dreamed of bringing the lands of the Rumarean people back under his wing, but as he saw the conditions of his home as he slipped into the harbor under cover... he seriously considered turning his back on those ideas.\n\nWhat is a Griffon to do?"
 dawn.1.a:0 "We must save what can be saved..."
 dawn.1.b:0 "Yma o Hyd!"
 
 dawn.2.t:0 "The Dual Language Act"
 dawn.2.d:0 "Alaric sat at his desk in the Baron's manor with a paper sitting in front of him. But he could not read it. He was a literate griffon of course, he could read 4 languages and speak 3 fluently but this was in the Imperial language, something his father had shunned for long, and had tried and failed to root our of his land. He flipped to the back and thankfully found a translation written in Rumarean and began to ponder what he was about to do. To make Imperial an official language was an ultimate capitulation. But one must first kneel to be able to stand back up."
 dawn.2.a:0 "Times are changing..."
 
 dawn.3.t:0 "The Return of the Diaspora"
 dawn.3.d:0 "Today thousands of native Rumareans would step back on Ruamrean shores again. And there will soon be many more!"
 dawn.3.a:0 "Welcome home!"
 
 dawn.4.t:0 "The Rumarean Language Act"
 dawn.4.d:0 "By decree of his majesty the Baron of Rumare and all Rumareans in diaspora he decrees,\n\nAll government texts in Rumare shall be written in the lounge of the fathers.\nAll public signs made by the state shall be in, exclusively Rumarean.\nAll of those in the Barony who can not speak Rumarean shall be provided an opportunity to, failing to accept will result in a fee.\nAnd most importantly. All children are banned from having the name "Grover""
 dawn.4.a:0 "Yma o Hyd..."
 
 dawn.5.t:0 "The Free Rumare Army"
 dawn.5.d:0 "If you are reading this you are playing a Baronry that no one actually cares about and only serves as a punching bag for all the actual majors. Oh yeah, btw. You are Rumare's punching bag now also.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave fun."
 dawn.5.a:0 "Terrorists the lot of them!"
 
 dawn.6.t:0 "The Return of the Old Gods"
 dawn.6.d:0 "Alaric was deep in the forests on the most secluded area on the island of Rumare, these lands were sacred to him and his people, and he came here daily for some sort of religious event. Some were more enjoyable then others, the worst being to the god of knowledge Ymenydd, and the best being either the god of games or well... let's say the god of "indulgence" to be polite.\n\nBut today was special. It was the feast of Arcturius, the god stolen from them by the Imperials and desecrated by their false shrines. He had had an ancient artifact imported from his new lands, a spear with which Arcurius slew the great Maaw, which threatened to consume all Griffonkind. And so he sat and prayed, prayed for the deliverance of his people."
 dawn.6.a:0 "Praise be to Arcturius!"
 
 dawn.7.t:0 "The Return of the Language"
 dawn.7.d:0 "Alaric read his reports and smiled. He read of book clubs and social groups. Of sports teams and workshops. And of restaurants and taverns. But most importantly to him, he read these things in Rumarean and read about Rumareans. It was, for the first time in the reign of him, his father, or many fathers before that, growing. More Griffons began to speak their ancestral lounge, and it showed. The Ruiniad had turned into a rebirth for his people. And he could not be more proud."
 dawn.7.a:0 "Yma o Hyd!"
 
 dawn.8.t:0 "The Return of the Diaspora"
 dawn.8.d:0 "Alaric watched from a boat in the lake as any more boats like it docked in the harbor of their great new land. They were his people, his comrades and yet he felt a tinge of pain. For he had made an oath and he would not yet step on those shores himself. His people asked them to simply sail forth and go with them, but he still had work to do.\n\nHe still had to make his Baronry proud to be Rumarean."
 dawn.8.a:0 "Welcome home!"
 
 dawn.9.t:0 "Yr Eryr Wen Dros Eincartref"
 dawn.9.d:0 ""Once again today! I present to you all, citizens of the liberated lands of Rumare! Your Baron and liberator, Alaric Dawnbreaker!"\n\nIt was a moment of redemption for Alaric. For so many years he had gone off, fighting other's wars, killing Griffons, Ponies and even Zebras alike. Battle after battle, payment after payment, bloody dawn after bloody dawn. All to one day return home and achieve what his father couldn't.\n\nHis father\n\nArcturius bless him... he wished he could see this day. To see the people clap and cheer, to exclaim his praises for giving them true freedom from the tyranny of the oppressors.\n\nThis moment might have even been cathartic if it wasn't for the lack of his father's grey wing around him. But even as he put on a smiling face for the crowd, and even as he sulked inside, he noticed a light shining from far away, a light emanating from the top of the Griffonstone Mountain, the location of Arcturias' great pantheon. And he knew his father was home."
