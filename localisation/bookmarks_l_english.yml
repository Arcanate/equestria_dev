 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "The End of Harmony"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A new era has dawned. Fear and uncertainty spreads amongst ponies as the world around them changes rapidly in front of their very eyes. Equestrian leadership is concerned about their neighbours, Stalliongrad and Changelings alike. While the communists in Stalliongrad rapidly industrialise, Queen Chrysalis has managed to centralise her realm around her. Equestria, while concerned about these developments, faces plenty of internal conflicts and problems. A storm is brewing in Equestria, one that friendship alone might not be able to tame."
 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Hitting of the Fan"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
 EQS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Equestria, ruled by the alicorn sisters Celestia and Luna, has lived in Harmony for over a millennium. The nation faced many minor threats in the recent past, and yet defended itself valiantly with the power of friendship, tolerance and forgiveness. Times seem to be changing, however, as Equestria’s enemies have awoken from their slumber. The peace-loving pony nation finds itself in a new world with foes not just to the west and east, but amongst their midst as well. How will Equestria approach the troubling times ahead? Will friendship and Harmony endure?"
 CHN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Not long ago, Queen Chrysalis and her changelings made a daring attempt to infiltrate and take over Equestria by invading its capital, Canterlot. This undertaking, luckily for the Equestrians, turned out to be a disaster. Anger and lust for revenge reinforced the already strong hatred for the ponies amongst changelings. In the recent years, Chrysalis has managed to gain almost full support for her cause, centralising all Changeling hives around her and her alone. Under her reign, the army saw brutal, rapid modernisation with the introduction of modern firearms, vehicles and tactics. Will the changelings finally defeat their hated enemies, or will Equestria stand their ground once more?"
 STG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Soviet Republic of Stalliongrad, located in the Equestrian northeast, split from Equestria and the Crystal Empire not long ago, aiming to establish a new society, in which all ponies are equal. Unfortunately, the current situation is far from the perfect communist utopia. The attempted rapid industrialisation has come to a stop due to lack of resources, and food has become scarce. Many fear that a famine will strike soon, with Equestrian sanctions denying much needed food imports. The ruling Communist Party is unsure how to handle this crisis, locked in a struggle for power between three distinct ponies. Whoever wins the following election will lead the country in this time of uncertainty: what will the future hold for Stalliongrad?"
 OLE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Home of the deers, the Kingdom of Olenia is an old trading nation. It had long been the leading trading power in its region, however political instability and corruption have caused plenty of problems. The lower classes of society suffer the most, and unrest is spreading quickly. The situation had only gotten worse following the rise of King Johan Djavulen, an unlawful and incredibly corrupt leader. The current rightful heir to the throne, Queen Velvet, has drawn up plans to retake the throne, but requires help to do so. Will the Equestrians help the Queen in need? Will the fires of revolution engulf the streets of Hjortland? Will the deers survive the changeling threat to the north?"
 CRY_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Crystal Empire, a young nation dependent on Equestria, enters the coming storm with uncertainty. A long time ago, it had disappeared, vanishing into thin air following the defeat of King Sombra, the evil, corrupted tyrant. A few years ago, however, he returned, bringing his empire with him. The villain was ultimately defeated and banished thanks to Equestrian aid, however, and shortly after an Equestrian alicorn, Mi Amore Cadenza was put into power to replace the former ruler. Many wonder how the Crystal Empire will approach this new era ahead. Will the thankful crystal ponies stay loyal to their ally and overlord, Equestria? Or will darkness return once more?"
 YAK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The quiet, isolated kind of the yaks have always made it a priority to keep their traditions alive. Due to this, yaks have never shared much interest in politics, whether that be foreign and domestic. However, not even the yaks can ignore the thunderclouds gathering on the horizon, and they might finally be forced to take action. What will the future hold for the yaks? Will the yak way of life endure, or will this new age bring along a new reign?"
GRF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the collapse of the Griffon's ancient Empire nearly 30 years ago Nova Griffonia has found itself independant for the first time after 200 years. However due to Nova Griffonia's over-reliance on Imperial industrial goods and military protection she has found herself suffering heavily in the recent years. Her armies are comprised of militias barely held together by their commanders, the economy has practically collapsed, to top it off the many dissidents the old Empire sent to her shores have become more active and violent than ever. The only thing keeping the country together is Governor Teafether's sheer force of will, but no one lives forever..."
GFF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Although an unrecognised state by everyone but Nova Griffonia, the Griffon Frontier enjoys some amount of autonomy from its master. The country is far from content, however, as its virtually non existent budget is unable to fund its industry, army or infrastructure. And now, like all the years before, it is about time for Governor Muck to visit Weter, the capital of Nova Griffonia, and ask for funds once more. He would better return with good news, as he has many enemies back at home who would love to take his place…"
