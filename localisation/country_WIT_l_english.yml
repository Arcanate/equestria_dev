WIT_unicorn_parties:0 "Mage-Nobles of Wittenland"
WIT_unicorn_parties_desc:0 "Powerful and influential, the nobles of Wittenland known as the Witan are held to a high standard not because they hold vast tracts of land, but because of their unrivalled magical prowess. Even as Wittenland stagnated, incompetent nobles rose to power and the lower classes became increasingly dissatisfied with their position, these peers remained a force to be reckoned with. They exert their influence in the Witenagemot, an advisory assembly that over time began to rival the monarch in power. As a result, the nation is highly focused on everything unicorn, at the expense of other pony races, who are politely discriminated at best."

## Army Tree ##

WIT_Review_Wittenland_Military:0 "Review the Wittenland Military"
WIT_Review_Wittenland_Military_desc:0 "A brief assessment of our armed forces leads to the conclusion that our grand military is not only outdated, but woefully underequipped. The military is in dire need of a reform, as it follows an inefficient and old structure. A study into how we can adapt our military is the only course of action."

WIT_superior_firepower_focus:0 "Maelstrom Of Death"
WIT_superior_firepower_focus_desc:0 "In the magically oriented society of Wittenland, flair has distinguished an exceptional unicorn from the rest. It shouldn't be too difficult to adapt this concept for our grand military. The last thing our foes shall see are the most aesthetic, yet deadly explosions."

WIT_import_artillery:0 "Import Artillery From Abroad"
WIT_import_artillery_desc:0 "Having fallen behind on the development of artillery, it falls on us to learn from our allies, or would be rivals. Magic itself cannot replace years of study and development, but having an advanced, functional model of foreign ordinance would do wonders for our needs."

WIT_scrying_company:0 "Utilize Scrying Magic"
WIT_scrying_company_desc:0 "No pony mage, however talented he might be, can see the future. Those who attempted have gone mad, or simply wasted an extensive amount of effort. However, it is well within a decent mage's ability to see events transpiring on a distant location. If the ponies on the field knew what they faced in advance, they would have a greater success rate."

WIT_offensive_infantry_training:0 "Offensive Infantry Training"
WIT_offensive_infantry_training_desc:0 "Although Wittenland prides itself on its numerous mountain holds which have repelled numerous invaders, primarily the vicious Cossacks of the south, warfare has changed and a grand defence cannot win a war on its own. Let us stop hiding behind ramparts and charge our foes, horns blazing."

WIT_overcharged_rifles:0 "Overcharged Magical Rifles"
WIT_overcharged_rifles_desc:0 "Among the nations of the Riverlands, Wittenland was the first to came up independently of the idea for magically infused weaponry. Soon after came the first successful prototype to be used in the field. Following the request from the high command, our engineers will work out a method in making the rifles more powerful, without greatly compromising its reliability."

WIT_anti_tank_tactics:0 "Purchase Anti-Tank Weaponry"
WIT_anti_tank_tactics_desc:0 "Tanks have already made their impact on the battlefield, and their usage is rapidly spreading. Magical rifle shots bounce off armour plates, regular artillery is too inaccurate to counter them. Once more we shall turn to foreign inventions to close the gap in our knowledge, so that we may always be prepared for what we face on the field."

WIT_grand_battleplan_focus:0 "A Bulwark Of Stone And Steel"
WIT_grand_battleplan_focus_desc:0 "Citadels built from mortar and stone may have gone out of fashion, but the idea of a defensive doctrine itself remains relevant. Wittenland needs to merely modernise its existing knowledge and strategies to remain an unassailable fortress no lesser foe shall overcome."

WIT_mandatory_magical_training:0 "Mandatory Magical Training"
WIT_mandatory_magical_training_desc:0 "While it is not possible to have an army made fully of unicorns, we can make strides in expanding the training unicorns go through. To give them more options, to cast complex spells while in the heat of combat, that is the mark of a disciplined soldier, and we would greatly benefit in increasing our standards."

WIT_healing_magic:0 "Recruit Mage Healers"
WIT_healing_magic_desc:0 "Restorative magics are a woefully underappreciated branch of the arcane spectrum. It is rare to find unicorns with the aptitude and desire to specialise in it, but we believe we can spread this knowledge so that a greater number of ponies are able to utilise it. Nothing needs more healers than the army itself, as well."

WIT_mage_engineers:0 "Magical Engineering"
WIT_mage_engineers_desc:0 "A sufficient mastery of the arcane can adequately replace physical hoofwork. That is to say, shovels and satchel charges would become less important, as a corps of skilled magically trained engineers would replace "ordinary" engineers. Of course, a full conversion would not possible, but it is something we should be very interested in looking towards."

WIT_modern_fortifications:0 "Modern Fortifications"
WIT_modern_fortifications_desc:0 "Much like how an old castle has its rings of walls, modern defences have many trenches, nested bunkers, mines and lines of barbed wire and machine guns. To adequately protect our proud home, investment should be given towards fortifying crucial areas of our nation. The question is, where to start?"

WIT_mountain_combat_mastery:0 "Mountain Combat Mastery"
WIT_mountain_combat_mastery_desc:0 "Unlike other Riverland nations who rely on professional corps of pegasi, inspired by the Nimbusians, Wittenland's pride lies within its mountaineers, who are able to traverse difficult terrain to place themselves in an advantageous position. Further training and accolades should be given to them, so that they can remain at the top of their profession."

WIT_expand_crystal_mines:0 "Expand Darnish Crystal Mines"
WIT_expand_crystal_mines_desc:0 "Crystals are a much needed resource in a society such as Wittenland's. A necessary component in magical experiments, recent innovations have uncovered an efficient method of balancing the frequencies between spells and crystals themselves, resulting in an harmonic resonance. Mines will have to be dug deeper to satisfy the demand for more crystals."

WIT_revive_palatine_schools:0 "Revive Palatine Schools"
WIT_revive_palatine_schools_desc:0 "In the ages long past, the Palatine Unicorn Guard accompanied Wittenland's monarch on military marches. Renowned for their unyielding defensive tactics and almost impregnable magical shields, they became infamous for attempting to play kingmaker during a troubled time. Although we have no need for such a force, their strategies are worthwhile to introduce again."

WIT_expand_excubitors:0 "Expand The Ranks Of Excubitors"
WIT_expand_excubitors_desc:0 "Formed the replace the decadent and lazy Palatine Guard, the Excubitors are Wittenland's premiere fighting force, battle-hardened against the many Cossack attacks. Their presence among the supporting battalions could lift the heart of any forlorn pony. Their numbers have shrunk over the years, and we believe the Excubitors could use a much needed revival."

WIT_crystal_crafting_mastery:0 "Crystal Crafting Mastery"
WIT_crystal_crafting_mastery_desc:0 "Crystals are a natural medium for storing spells due to the similar frequencies both possess. Yet, they are incredibly fragile and require a master spellweaver and crystalblower to avoid shattering during the transfer. Their skills are a closely guarded secret earned by years of work, but it is necessary in this age to spread the knowledge wide."

WIT_new_mage_generals:0 "A Nimbusian Attache"
WIT_new_mage_generals_desc:0 ""
#A tree falls so that its seeds may grow anew. With the recent expansion and modernisation of our complete armed forces, the Wittenland general staff has become insufficient. It must expand, with bright new strategists to properly lead our contemporary armies to victory. We have already decided on several promising candidates.
WIT_enchanted_tanks:0 "Enchanted Armour Experimentation"
WIT_enchanted_tanks_desc:0 "Armoured vehicles have already shown their worth in the wider world, but Wittelandic ingenuity could take them to the next level of effectiveness. If armour plates could be quickly and reliably enchanted, without an insurmountable cost in resources, Wittenland shall be at the forefront in the new age of warfare. The state should sponsor those who have already begun experimenting."

WIT_proving_day:0 "Magical Proving Day"
WIT_proving_day_desc:0 "One of the many traditions that grace Wittenland are Magical Provings, competitions where sorcerers would show off their inate talents and perform bedazzling feats of arcane mastery. Those who rise to the top would not only be eligible for rewards, but also an opportunity for employment. It is not just a recruitment drive, but also a festival that celebrates the magical abilities of Wittenlanders."

WIT_restore_austurian_guard:0 "Restore The Austurian Guard"
WIT_restore_austurian_guard_desc:0 "When Wittenland was subjugated and defeated, it was King Haysil II and his heroic band of deer mercenaries who freed our nation, and the same deer became the protectors of this realm. Yet this guard dispersed over the past centuries. To the south, Austurland has recently experienced a turmoil, and many of their nobles have been exiled. We can offer them a home, in exchange for service."

######### Industrial ##########

WIT_invite_advisors_desc:0 "Wittenland may yet be great, but first it needs to rely on a helping hoof from our kin. [RCT.GetName] and [LCT.GetName] are farther ahead in industrial development, and this is evident by their growing wealth, population and production. Distasteful as we may be of foreign influences, we have little choice but to invite several captains of industry to help modernise Wittenland. For a price, of course."
WIT_hire_diamond_dogs:0 "Hire Diamond Dog Miners"
WIT_hire_diamond_dogs_desc:0 "The Diamond Dogs to the north are a brutish race, yet even beasts have their uses. They are experts without peer in excavation, and given their relatively undereducated standards, we can even pay them less than we would our earth ponies. A small price for uncovering the vast mineral wealth we possess, which is crucial for our further development."
WIT_ivanhorn_dam:0 "Build The Ivanhorn Dam"
WIT_ivanhorn_dam_desc:0 "The river near Ivanhorn is in a suitable position for the construction of a modern dam, which will provide new jobs and energy, but also fresh water for domestic, industrial and irrigation purposes. Cooperation with Lakeish engineers will be required, as we cannot manage this project on our own entirely, but the benefits more than make up for it. The ecological effect is also estimated to be minimal."
WIT_railway_tunnels:0 "Excavate Railroad Tunnels"
WIT_railway_tunnels_desc:0 "The mountains we call home, the same ones we worship present a barrier towards connecting our nation. Although it is certainly possible to plan an another route for railways, it is more expensive than simply digging our way through the rock with shovels and explosives. Connecting our nation would open up further development, as well as showcase the ingenuity of Wittelandic engineers."
WIT_food_problem:0 "The Food Problem"
WIT_food_problem_desc:0 "As population grows, so does the need for more produce. Wittenland itself is sparse on suitable land, however. While the simple solution would be to increase food imports, it would be costlier in the long run and subject to the whims of our trading partners. Alternatively, we could expand traditional Wittelandic terrace farms, which would be time consuming, yet effective. The choice is on [WIT.GetLeader]."
WIT_industrial_light_and_magic:0 "Industrial Light And Magic"
WIT_industrial_light_and_magic_desc:0 "The arcane is omnipractical and can be adapted to any purpose. One such possibility is to use magic in our industrial centres to enchant tools and production lines - a griffon technique admittedly, but its efficiency cannot be denied. We must utilise our strengths to push forwards to a bright future."
WIT_import_rijekan_machinery:0 "Import Rijekan Machinery"
WIT_import_rijekan_machinery_desc:0 "Because of their secure location, [RCT.GetName] were able to devote extensive resources towards industrialisation and electrification. As such, they're one of the most development nations in the Riverlands, and it would be an insult to Wittelandic pride if we couldn't keep up. We must strike a deal for their machinery, so that we can eventually engineer our own."
WIT_lakeish_arms_contract:0 "Contract With Lakeish Arms Companies"
WIT_lakeish_arms_contract_desc:0 "Lake City has been on the frontline against many griffon incursions - the hated knightly orders have attempted many times to murder and disperse innocent ponies. Thus they were forced to keep improving and manufacturing new firearm designs, to counter the dense armour of griffon knights. Perhaps some of their arms companies would be willing to work with our gunsmiths, in exchange for payment?"
WIT_nationwide_electrification:0 "Nationwide Electrification"
WIT_nationwide_electrification_desc:0 "Electricity is the light of the future. It can run almost indefinitely, as long as there's a power source, and doesn't rely on a unicorn to relight a torch. If the entire state could be connected by an electrical grid, all aspects of society would be drastically improved, as long as everypony is taught on proper care and maintenance."

#### EVENTS ####
wittenland.1.t:0 "The Springfield Festival"
wittenland.1.d:0 "Queen White Star cut the ribbon announcing the start of the Springfield Festival, a celebration of the end of winter in Wittenland. Unlike in other pony nations, here there weren't enough pegasi to properly manage weather, so the coming of spring was always a relief worth celebrating. The Queen's subjects stomped their hooves in approval, whilst conservative nobles stood beside her majesty, barely masking their distaste for the commoners. The mountain monks in their humble robes blessed the audience, and the feasting could now begin.\n\nWhite Star smiled. Attending a smaller festival in Ivanhorn, instead of the lavish square of Wittenburgh, has been an inspired choice. Lord Wulfric of Cumricia, however, was furious. He had already been grumbling about the burdens placed upon him by granting peasants additional rights, and now he was forced to stand with former serfs and new money to attend alongside the Queen.\n\nShe briefly frowned, considering the problems it might cause, and then brightened. The Guildmaster of the Calcrond Artificers was drinking wine, standing by a table laden with some of the finest produce of the last year's harvesting season. The nobles were hesitant to eat the peasant food, but commoners like the Guildmaster seemed to enjoy it. A little suggestion here and there, a trade concession or two, and Wulfric would find himself difficulty in getting priority shipping over some of the newer merchants from the lower classes. Wulfric would understand immediately. He knew the game as well as anypony.\n\nQueen White Star took a sip of wine as she approached the Guildmaster. This would be a long, but productive day..."
wittenland.1.a:0 "A strong start to the year."

wittenland.2.t:0 "The Gallant Gala"
wittenland.2.d:0 "Lyres were played as exquisitely dressed mage-nobles crossed the marble floors of the Wittenburgh Gala Hall. Centuries old silverware had been neatly arranged on the tables, while exotic foods from distant lands sat alongside traditional Wittenlandic peasant dishes.\n\nWhispers followed Queen White Star as she entered. There would be Tartarus to pay for her little stunt in Ivanhorn, and here, surrounded by the most elite of Wittenland at the most exclusive ball of the season, she would find little support from her new friends amongst the middle classes.\n\nHer mareservant, Dayne, returned with a glass of Vinovian wine, taking an opportunity to lean close. "My Queen, Steel Little has expressed openness to leaving the Count of Papaglia to work with you, but I've urgent news. Lord Wulfric and two of the Barons from Hengestdelu have secured exclusive trading rights with one of the new electronics manufacturers in Rijekograd."\n\nWhite Star turned in shock, before smiling as if she had mistakenly thought she had recognised someone as she hissed "What?! How? Those contracts were supposed to be open bid!"\n\nShe calculated, her heart racing. Despite her previous successes, with the extra wealth and influence generated by these contacts, the conservative factions would be strengthened for years to come. Maintaining her existing reforms might become a battle, much less passing new reforms.\n\nHer thoughts were interrupted as a smiling Lord Wulfric held out his hoof. "May I have the pleasure of a dance, Your Highness?" White Star worked to keep her composure. With Wulfric hosting this year's Gala, it would be an egregious breach of courtesy to refuse the invitation..."
wittenland.2.a:0 "This is going to be a long evening."

wittenland.200.t:0 "The Annual Queening"
wittenland.200.d:0 "The doors of the Royal Palace opened as Wittenland's most powerful unicorns strode into the throne room. The annual hearing of the challenges was a sacred Wittenland tradition - the foundation of their ancient meritocracy, the last remnant of a golden age where anyone with enough skill, learning and determination could challenge the reigning monarch to a magical duel and potentially become the new ruler, no matter their background. Yet even then, only those with the support of the Witenagemot could issue a challenge, and more often than not proper education in magic could only be afforded by the wealthy. One day, White Star hoped all this would change. But for now, she needed to remain secure in her rule to pass her reforms, so the number challengers remained limited.\n\nShe sat on her throne, rubbing her forehead with her hoof and calming her nerves. No amount of skill could make a duel safe for either side, and her safety relied more on expedience than skill - a defeat would be politically devastating for Wulfric, and even should he win, the nobility might ignore his demands. Perhaps even worse for Wulfric, she could simply step down and grant him the throne, assemble her supporters, and return in strength later.\n\nHer mareservant Dayne addressed the crowd: "The Queen issues a call - let any who have the backing of the Witenagemot and the magical skill to take the Crown step forward." There was a small commotion at the back of the crowd, but no one spoke. Wulfirc stood at the back of the hall, his face as motionless as stone. White Star relaxed. The ruckus was likely caused by a young hothead mage who had just been restrained by his peers. "Let it be noted that the Queen continues her rule as the legitimate, uncontested ruler of the Kingdom of Wittenland!" Dayne announced.\n\nWulfric glanced at White Star as he turned to leave. She frowned, and felt like she had seen an ominous grin on his lips."
wittenland.200.a:0 "Until next year, then."

wittenland.3.t:0 "The Debate"
wittenland.3.d:0 "The galleries of the Great Library echoed as Queen White Star outlined her plans for the year, with various nobles standing to make objections, comments and agreements. As usual, it was the topic of political reform that attracted the most attention. The argument became increasingly heated as the progressive supporters of White Star clashed with conservatives led by Lord Wulfric.\n\nThe grey mage-noble grew tired of the bickering and rose up, speaking with a loud and raspy voice. "I do not see why you see reform as an urgent necessity. Wittenland has stood for a thousand years, outlasting both of its foes, the petty Princes of Jezeragrad and Rijekograd. Defended by our magic and our mountain gods, it shall stand a thousand years more."\n\nWhite Star decided to counter him personally. "Lord Wulfric, may I remind you that after their monarchies ended, Lake City and River Republic surpassed us in military and economic power, modernizing rapidly? And I wonder what the ponies of Ivanhorn thought of the power of magic and mountains when Gryphian Cossacks burned their city to the ground, making it clear we were too weak to defend ourselves and had to join the River Coalition. Do you want us to fall behind even more and remain a rural backwater, or do you want us to catch up to our neighbours?"\n\n"Bah! You want to give the commoners a hoof, and they will take the entire leg. You are blind to the dangers of liberalism. River Republic recently had a crisis that brought their pathetic republic to a standstill and Lake City's government is a slave to its army. If we look further, we see what happened when Equestria, Aquileia and the Griffonian Empire allowed liberal ideas to flourish. Our western cousins lost one of their wealthiest provinces, the griffon King lost his head, and the Empire collapsed entirely.""
wittenland.3.a:0 "The audience murmurs..."

wittenland.300.t:0 "The Debate Continues"
wittenland.300.d:0 "The mage-nobles murmured. Wulfric was right. It could not be denied that liberalism, if taken to an extreme, was dangerous.\n\nWhite Star pursed her lips, persisting on the argument. "Those terrible things didn't happen because liberal ideas were 'allowed to flourish'. They happened because of the opposite. Repression and decadence led to unrest, and attempts to suppress that unrest ended in disaster. And regarding our neighbours, it cannot be denied that they have issues, but we should learn from them instead of disregarding their politics entirely because they're not perfect. In the end, Lake City and River Republic dominate the Riverlands, and that is because they embraced liberal and progressive values. They did so after abolishing their Principalities, but it does not need to be like that for us. If you don't want Wittenland to share the fate of all those monarchies you spoke of, the fate of revolution and even bloodshed, then yes, reform is not only necessary, but urgent."\n\nMost of the nobles nodded in agreement, and the rest remaind silent. Even Lord Wulfric could do little more than frown. He still did not agree with White Star, but the counter-arguments he had in mind would not convince White Star and her sycophant supporters. He had no choice but to humbly bow and concede the debate. White Star allowed herself a rare smile, and the mage-nobles commended her arguments. Several conservative nobles promised to now be on her side and support her reforms, even if it meant limiting their power. Perhaps they had finally realized the greater good of Wittenland was more important than securing their own power."
wittenland.300.a:0 "That went better than expected."

wittenland.4.t:0 "The Derby"
wittenland.4.d:0 "At the grand Hippodrome of Wittenburgh, ponies laughed, cheered and roared as athletes raced, leaped and posed in displays of athleticism. Bets were made whilst mage-nobles proudly posed for photographs with athletes from their provinces and Wittenland's newest import - the radio - broadcast breathless commentary to ponies who eagerly huddled around display units in electronics stores.\n\nQueen White Star made her usual rounds, soothing egos, making promises and twisting legs as necessary. She was in an especially good mood, having convinced Thunder Amethyst, one of Witterburgh's finest tacticians, to consider employment with her. While the Derby was primarily an entertainment event, politics were entwined to it as well. It was a great opportunity to meet ponies from all societal classes and to discuss politics. Even the ever-growing divide in society could be seen in the most popular race teams: The Whites, who were cheered on by liberally minded ponies, and the Reds, who received the support of the conservatives.\n\nWine and beer flowed freely (as they always did) and audience members got increasingly drunk. Their emotions, already intensified by exciting competition, became stronger. The final event of the day, a championship race between the Whites and the Reds, seemed to make them go crazy. Mage-nobles and commoners alike grew ever louder and restless, flinging insults both at the atheletes and the supporters of the opposing team. White Star could sense the tension which made her uneasy. The Reds supporters saw her lack of enthusiasm, and mocked the fans of the Whites, saying the Queen had abandoned their team.\n\nWhen the race began, violence finally broke out. First in small bursts, but whenever one team got the lead, the hooffights and spellcasting became more and more extreme. White Star grew so anxious that she prepared to order the Excubitors to restore order before it was too late, but feared that would only make things worse. But after a member of the Reds seemed to break the rules by tripping up a runner of the Whites, all Tartarus broke loose.\n\nIt escalated into a full-scale riot, with the stands turning into a battlefield. At this point, it had to be done, and White Star ordered the Excubitors to step in and end the madness at once. When the dust had settled and the crowd separated by glowing spell-barriers, several ponies were found dead on both sides. The race was cancelled, and that year neither team would be the champions."
wittenland.4.a:0 "Something must be done about this divide."

wittenland.5.t:0 "Independence Day"
wittenland.5.d:0 "White Star adorned herself in the formal battle regalia of a Wittenland Spell-General, groaning as she did so. On this day 654 years ago, King Haysil II the Lakepony Slayer restored the Kingdom of Wittenland and declared independence from Jezeragrad's River Empire. It was an important celebration for all Wittenlanders, but for White Star, it was far too pompous, militaristic and nationalistic. She felt like independence was not worth much if the nation itself was a mere shadow of its former self.\n\nSince the days of King Haysil, the southern coast had been lost, the mercenary deer of Austurland and the tribes of Pònaidhean had declared independence, and Coltstream had been seized by the Rijekans. Wittenland itself was stuck in the past, failing to keep up with its northern neighbours, stuck with an archaic society with little social mobility. Yet on this day, you had to pretend to be proud of your nation, and criticism was forbidden. "Wittenland on ecnesse", as the ponies fanatically chanted.\n\nWhite Star took a deep breath and left the Palace to attend the military parade on the streets of the capital. The banners of the Kingdom were everywhere, fluttering in the cold mountain wind. Commoners and mage-nobles alike spectated the marching columns of soldiers as the army bands played patriotic tunes with their drums and horns. White Star held her head high. She was determined to make this day worth celebrating, so everypony could be genuinely proud of their nation. Maybe make the celebration less about independence and more about their society itself. Tone down the militarism and make it a cultural festival. Yes, that is what she would do. And she would never let the selfish nobles hold her back. She would make Wittenland great again, but not in the way Wulfric and his lapdogs wanted."

wittenland.6.t:0 "The Grand Fair"
wittenland.6.d:0 "The Grand Fair, held in Wittenburgh's Merchant District, overflowed with abundance. This year's highlights included a magical self-filling wine fountain, a re-enactment of famous historical battles (inevitably, some poor pegasus servants were roped into playing as griffons) and a travelling troupe of Hippogriff performers from across the seas.\n\nIn the middle of it all, White Star sat glumly. Despite her success in the debate, Lord Wulfric had capitalised on his new trading rights to cement several alliances and increase his influence amongst the nobility. Eventually, she would undoubtedly face a choice between postponing some of her reforms or facing a leadership challenge.\n\nSo when a runner delivered notes on the morning's trade, White Star did not look up until the usually taciturn Lord Wulfric uttered a curse and hurriedly excused himself from the festivities. Despite their propriety, White Star and the assembled nobles, could not help but curiously crowd around the runner. Even the Hippogriff doing a surprisingly sophisticated double backwards somersault through a hoop whilst whistling the Wittenland national anthem failed to distract.\n\nWhite Star impatiently summoned a copy, reading. A successful venture led by Merchant Captain Honoria had returned from Equestria laden with high quality, competitively priced electronics, and with a guarantee from a New Mareland bank underwriting further deliveries.\n\nShe began to laugh. Wulfric's monopolies on obsolete equipment were now an expensive disaster, another victim of the new money in a new world. So distracted in her glee, she didn't notice the letter until her mareservant Dayne politely, but determinedly, levitated it inches from her face."

wittenland.601.d:0 "The river barge slowly approached the dock of Wittenburgh, and the vessel's captain, Honoria Goldmane, was already standing on the prow. She breathed in the clean mountain air. "Ah, it's good to be back home. Is it not, Voliare?" She looked behind her shoulder at her brown-bearded companion, who was at the ship's wheel.\n"As always. It's a relief to be safely back home."\nHonoria hopped down from the prow. "Not just that. It also means another lucrative venture was successful!" She opened a hatch on the floor and looked down into the cargo bay, which was loaded with metallic machines and gadgets. "These crystal-powered computers from Sicameon will fetch a fine price on the market."\nVoliare smiled faintly. Honoria had known poverty for her entire life, so now, being able to attain wealth and influence despite being a former serf like him, made her very glad and confident in herself. But he hoped she would not let the desire for more overcome her.\n\nThere was a loud thump as the ship docked. Honoria already thought of her customers, of aspiring industrialists and middle class merchants, fellow members of a new generation who had earned their wealth from merit alone. She felt a strong bond with them, and thought that together they could make Wittenland a truly great realm. Meanwhile Voliare looked at the dozens of haulers who began to unload the ship, most of them earth ponies wearing little more than old rags. Despite being a unicorn, he felt sympathy for them. Serfs like him and her might have been freed, but Wittenlandic society still had those who were downtrodden and oppressed. Not everyone was as fortunate as he had been."

wittenland.602.d:0 "Once the unloading of cargo and the associated paperwork had been taken care of, Honoria and Voliare headed to a nearby pub to celebrate their return home with tankards of ale. "Say, Honoria, what are your plans for the future?" Voliare asked. "I don't imagine you plan on hoarding more and more wealth forever like some dragon."\nHonoria chuckled. "No, no. I have... other plans. I want to do something meaningful instead of just dragging junk here from distant lands. You know how I've been practicing my magic lately?"\nVoliare nodded. "You've been buying all those expensive spellbooks, too."\n"My parents always said there was something special about me. That my magic was stronger than usual. Only now can I learn to wield that power."\n"And what on earth are you planning to do with it? Never saw you as some studious mage." Voliare shrugged and drank from the tankard.\nShe grinned. "With enough practice, I reckon I can challenge the Queen herself."\nThe stallion spat out the ale in shock. "What?! I thought you liked the Queen."\n"I do. I respect her greatly. But I feel like I could do an even better job than her." Honoria drank from the tankard as well and swiftly decided to switch topic. "And what do you dream of?"\nVoliare wiped the ale from his beard with a napkin. "Nothing much. A roof on top, a wife in bed and children in school. Soon I'll have enough coin to make that dream possible. I suppose we'll have to part ways at that point."\nHonoria smiled. "No, we don't we can always stay in touch and remain friends." She lifted the tankard high. "A toast to our eternal friendship!"\nVoliare smiled as well and clinked her tankard, then downed the drink."

wittenland.603.d:0 ""I cannot believe you made a deal with your former master," Voliare muttered as he and Honoria left Lord Wulfric's manor in Calcrond.\n"I had to make a deal with a demon," Honoria said. "He'll get those fancy electronics and in return he and his friends will support my challenge to the Queen."\n"Why is that gods-forsaken duel so important to you? You're willing to sacrifice your principles and possibly even your own life for it! Don't forget how dangerous the duels can be."\n"I feel like I have to do it. To prove to everypony that anyone, even a former serf, can become a Queen. When did Wittenland last have a peasant monarch who didn't come from the ranks of the nobility?"\n"There's more to it than that. Be honest with me, Honoria."\nShe sighed. "I also want to prove to myself that I can do it."\n"And? You want to become the Queen for a reason. Tell me what you want to do if you get the crown."\n"Fine! I want to make Wittenland a truly meritocratic nation, where anyone can become great. White Star, for all her greatness, hasn't gone far enough. She leaves the mage-nobles alone. She wants to fix things. I want to tear the whole rotten thing down and build it anew from ground up."\n"Ambitious, as always. And what of the poor? Those who, despite being freed, are still struggling with poverty?"\n"If they can't improve their lives by themselves, then maybe they deserve to be poor."\nVoliare stopped and closed his eyes. Honoria raised an eyebrow. "What's wrong?"\n"Honoria, I cannot support this. Either you'll die or you'll turn into a Queen that I do not wish to serve. Please, reconsider."\nHonoria frowned. "You've stood by my side ever since we met all those years ago, and now when I need you the most, you abandon me, just like that?"\n"Honoria, please, I-"\nHer nostrils flared. "Whatever. I don't need anyone. I am more than capable enough to overcome any obstacle myself. Good bye."\nShe turned around and left, her head held high. Voliare knew she acted unreasonably, but couldn't help but feel regretful for speaking out against her."

wittenland.7.t:0 "Proving Day"
wittenland.7.d:0 "[Root.GetLeader] moved through the various podiums as unicorns competed and demonstrated a variety of skills, from enchanting, planning, multitasking, to brute telekinetic strength.\n\nThe Proving Day was an ancient Wittenlandic tradition that Queen White Star had revived during her early reign. It was a day of contests and tests of magical and martial skill, rooted in the meritocratic values that the Kingdom was originally founded upon over a thousand years ago. Any unicorn could participate, regardless of background; the intent was to allow anypony to display their skills in public. This usually allowed ponies from the lower ranks of society to find an easy way to climb the ladder. Over the centuries, the Proving Day had deteriorated due to bribery, nepotism and cheating to the point where it became obsolete and was completely abandoned. The modern Proving Day had no such issues, and even conservative nobles had supported its return, as it had allowed them to find many useful mages and promising officers.\n\n[Root.GetLeader] has managed to poach several promising mage-generals. The first new general of the Wittenlandic army is Archmage River Run of High Mane. He is a unicorn blessed with the ability to cast powerful defensive spells. He pioneered the magical bubble shield spell which is used to defend the fortress of High Mane from raiders, basing it on a similar spell used in Canterlot, the capital of Equestria.\n\nThe second general is Mysteria of Ivanhorn, a pegasus who used to lead a small group of lightly armed ranger militia. They would stalk through the forests to ambush cossack raiders, expertly using camouflage and long-range rifles to avoid direct confrontation, always retreating after striking. Her experience in using local terrain could prove useful to us.\n\nLastly, there was Spirit Fire of Wintershorn, a unicorn pyromancer. An eccentric but very mighty mage capable of casting potent fire spells. Her sanity is questionable, but her magical abilities are not. The smell of burning griffon feathers has become familiar to the ponies of Wintershorn thanks to her.\n\nAll three have gladly accepted [Root.GetLeader] offer of positions in the military and are looking forward to loyally serve their homeland on the front."

He smiled. "However, this does offer up opportunities for heavier armour enchanting," He pointed to the prototype, a training model with newly welded plates of highly durable enchanted steel.

wittenland.10.d:0 "As Wittenland continues to develop, the issue of food security becomes ever more important. If we want our population and cities to keep growing, we will need to secure our supply of food. Currently, because of Wittenland's mountainous terrain, infertile soil and lack of pegasi to manage weather, we are reliant on limited food imports from neighbouring countries, primarily Lake City and River Republic. At the present, the price of food is high because there isn't enough of it produced and imported. Something must be done about the matter before malnourishment becomes a problem.\n\nThe leading advisors in our government have proposed two solutions to [Root.GetLeader]. First, we could sign additional trade agreements with other nations to increase our imports of food even further. This is a quick and easy solution that is, however, quite expensive, as we'll have to buy food from abroad. The other solution is to seek self-reliance on food with new farming methods. We could, for example, invest in terrace farming, which has traditionally been used in eastern Zebrica. This would allow our farmers to increase crop yields by exploiting marginal lands that are currently unused. However, it is a large-scale project that will require several years and thousands of workers to complete.\n\nIt is now up to [Root.GetLeader] to decide which solution to implement. The decision must be made soon, as the demand for food keeps growing."

We now have thousands of additional hectares of farmland ready to be used by our farmers, who have been educated on managing terrace farms so they can minimize soil erosion and maintain the channels and terraces in good condition.\n\nThe first harvest will be ready within a year, and it is expected our harvest will have almost doubled in size.

However, we can leverage our mastery of magic to improve our offensive capabilities.\n2. Our military doctrine, based around castles and defence from griffon raiders possessing more traditional weaponry, is ill equipped to the needs of the current era. This does not mean static defences need to be abandoned, but our tactics certainly need to be modernized.\n\nOn this basis, our Great Library has reviewed our current knowledge on various military theories around the world, and suggested approaches for integrating these with a unicorn army and an accelerated technology program matched to it.

A new generation of unicorns stand with me!"\n\nWhite Star paused briefly, and then motioned her Excubitors to continue. By dismissing the importance of the very classes she fought for, she embarrassed her cause, but such was politics.\n\nAnd yet again, the Excubitors stopped, risking White Star's wrath.

The former serf had learned much, and White Star realized her skills were now rivaled. She hated to admit it, but she had underestimated her challenger because of her background. This peasant mare could beat any mage-noble if she wanted.\n\nHonoria and White Star began conserving energy, firing energy bolts back and fourth, shielding and ducking. An foolhardy unshielded member of the audience was struck down and rushed to medical attention.\n\nHonoria decided to take a risk, casting a short range, energy-intensive teleportation spell to attempt to flank White Star."

But this time, there was not enough magic to sustain the exhausted pair for long. Both of them had been pushed to their limits, forced to use every trick they had learned, casting every cantrip and spell, pouring all their knowledge and energy into this fateful duel. They were both spent, unable to overcome one another, refusing to surrender. So now they were back at the beginning, using basic spells even foals knew how to cast. Yet it was these basic spells that would decide the fate of the two unicorns, and the fate Wittenland itself."

White Star loomed over her prone body, her horn shining ominously, engulfed by magical flames.\n\nHonoria closed her eyes, accepting her death. Queen White Star had proven the strongest and fittest to lead. The nation would be in fine hooves.\n\nWhite Star paused, regarding Honoria's composed resignation, and White Star began to reconsider once again. Wheels spun, gears clicked in her mind as possibilities played out, and the face of rage vanished as her usual unreadable smile snapped into place. She pulled Honoria to her hooves.\n\n"Ponies of the court. Today, we have seen something astounding. A mere serf, freed from her shackles, overthrew Wulfric's trade monopoly, mustered sufficient support to block the Queen's rejection, and almost succeeded in winning a duel for the crown. Wulric has had decades in order to achieve the same, and yet he has failed.\n\n"Why? Because he cannot understand that greatness is found in every pony, and grows best in those who must seek it, not have it handed to them. I, like Wulfric, feared that truth deep down, and thus I rejected Honoria's challenge. I am shamed, for in showing such skill despite her upbringing, she has proven her worth.""

Why was she offering Honoria the crown?\n\nWhite Star, smiling, leaned closer to her face. Honoria blushed. She could feel White Star's body still radiating heat from fire magic.\n\nWhite Star frowned with annoyance and hissed in her ear "If you wish to leave this room alive, refuse the crown!"\n\nHonoria shook herself, clearing her head. Yes... right, that made sense.\n\n"My...My Queen, I must refuse. You have proven your strength, and this offer proves the sincerity of your commitment." She kneeled. "I swear my fealty to you and your cause."\n\nHonoria rose and turned to the audience. She saw Wulfric, and how he glared at her in anger and disappointment. Perhaps he had been plotting something, but now it did not matter. The crown now belonged to the mare who deserved it. She smiled, and exclaimed loudly and clearly:"

wittenland_duel.11.d:0 "White Star's magic was exhausted, and with it her magical protection. She realized her own flames had set her mane ablaze and screamed. Soon her coat was burning too, and she was consumed by her own flames of anger. Honoria and nobles alike gasped, appalled at the sight. Panicking, White Star started galloping around the room and soon crashed headlong into a window. Her bright burning body fell down into the rocky ground below.\n\nLord Wulfric stepped forward. "The Witenagemot recognises Honoria as the new Queen of Wittenland." Honoria was panting, utterly exhausted from the duel, but smiled. She had done it. A former serf had beaten a noble Queen in a duel and deposed her.\n\nWulfric grinned. "With the support of the Witenagemot, I hereby challenge you to a duel for the crown, your majesty."\n\nFor a moment, Honoria stopped breathing. Had she understood Wulfric's words right? He was challenging her immediately after the duel, while she was still tired from it? "Excuse me? But I just won a duel!"\n\n"Indeed. However, nothing says the winner of a duel cannot immediately be challenged by another. Such is tradition. For example, poor King Alpferd III was deposed soon after he had earned his title. If you were a mage-noble, you would be aware of this ancient custom."\n\nHonoria was outraged by this betrayal. She knew Wulfric had sought to benefit from her, which is why he had agreed to support her in the first place. But she had thought deposing White Star and making a trade agreement would've been enough! Maybe she shouldn't have openly spoken against him before the duel...\n\nWhatever the case, she would not refuse. She had spent so much time, money and effort to defeat White Star, and now her former master wanted to take it all away from her? He would have to pry her crown from her cold dead hooves!"

wittenland_duel.12.d:0 "There was a brilliant flash of light and immediately Honoria was on her knees, unable to stand. Wulfric's horn shone brightly, almost blinding her. "Foolish serf," Wulfric said, contempt seeping from his voice. "What made you think you're fit to be Queen?"\n\nWith shaking legs, Honoria struggled to push herself up. She felt too weak to even cast a simple shielding spell. The only thing driving her onwards was her hatred of Wulfric, the cruel scoundrel who had oppressed her for so long. "At least I am more fit for it than you, senile wolf."\n\nWulfric's nostrils flared and his horn glowed again, ready to strike the final blow at Honoria. But the mare did something no one expected; she levitated a weapon from her pocket. Wulfric realized he was looking down the barrel of a gun. "What is this? A weapon? The rules of the duel strictly forbid them!" Wulfric shouted. "What legitimacy to you hope to gain from this?"\n\nHonoria grinned. "This is no regular weapon. It's a magical pistol I bought with my own hard-earned money."\n\nShe pulled the trigger, and it was as if a bolt of lightning struck Wulfric's forehead. The audience was in shock as Wulfric's lifeless and limp body collapsed on the floor. When the nobles realized what happened, many of them began to protest loudly. Honoria calmly blew the smoking barrel of the pistol and put it back in her pocket. White Star's mareservant Dayne was already browsing through an old bulky rulebook. "I... I can't find anything about magical firearms. But the rules do forbid the usage of magical artifacts such as staffs-"\n\nShe squealed as Honoria took the book from her hooves and threw it out of the window which White Star had broken. "Those don't matter. Wittenland does not need to cling on to ancient rules and traditions! As your new Queen, I intent to make new and better rules." She turned to the furious mage-nobles. "If any of you dispute my right to rule, go ahead and challenge me. I may still be tired, but I'm wiling to shoot all of you one by one if I need to."\n\nThe nobles stood silent for a while. Then, slowly and hesitantly, they bent the knee, aknowledging her as the rightful ruler of Wittenland."

Exhausted, White Star let her own protective magic flicker, and with the split-second drop of her own elemental protections, her own flames of anger set her mane ablaze. Soon she was running around and screaming as she burned alive. She ran headlong through a window and fell down into the rocky ground far below.\n\nThe crowd stared in horror. A death in a duel was rare enough, but two? This was a disaster. Honoria's retinue backed away and fled, and the Excubitors stood in confusion, unsure what to do.\n\nLord Wulfric stepped forward. "This barbaric display is White Star's doing. She pretended civility, but beneath it lay brute rage. And now she lies dead, killed by one of her own freed serfs."\n\nHe swept his gaze across the crowd. "Her reforms were mad, and this is the proof - self-immolation in the palace? A jumped-up merchant thinking they can run a nation? Our ancient traditions stained with blood and barbarism?"\n\n"All here know that without White Star I now have the Witenagemot's support. Therefore, I have no choice but to take her mantle. Are there any challenges?" The room stood silently.\n\n"Then as my first act as King of Wittenland, I announce that all of White Star's reforms will be repealed one by one, and that our ancient long-lost glory shall be fully restored!""

Now Wulfric was King, and he intended to tear down everything she had accomplished.\n\nThe news also spoke of the challenger's demise, without mentioning her name. But Voliare realized what had happened. Honoria was dead too. She had thrown her life away and doomed Wittenland. Yet somehow, he was the one who felt guilty. He felt like he should've been there, supporting Honoria, cheering for her. Maybe then she would've won the duel, or lost it without dying in the process. But alas, he had abandoned her.\n\nA spark set his heart aflame. He had to redeem himself, and oppose Honoria's former master. It's the least he could do to honour the memory of his best friend. He ran into the central square of Wittenburgh, grapped an empty crate, stood on it and began to speak to the crowd. He spoke boldly of what Wulfric would do, and that they needed to oppose him before it was too late. At first, only a few listened to him. Then, more and more ponies gathered around him. When the sun set in the horizon, he had gathered an audience of thousands. Merchants, workers, unicorns, pegasi, earth ponies and even a couple of griffons listened to him speak of the importance of resisting the mage-nobles, of the flaws of the succession system and the monarchy itself, of the need for democracy and equality. He only stopped speaking when a group of Excubitors warned him and threatened to arrest him if he continued. He fled, but the crowd had heard enough. This, Voliare hoped, would be the spark ignited the flame."

wittenland.34.d:0 "Thousands of ponies gathered in High Mane from all across the country to attend White Star's funeral. For the lower classes, she had been their hero and champion who had freed hundreds of thousands from serfdom. Some ponies had travelled here by hoof all the way from Wintershorn to grieve her unfortunate passing. Much of the mage-nobility was also there, except for the most hardcore conservatives and supporters of Wulfric. And of course, her majesty herself, Queen Honoria, who had organized the event. While she had paid her debt to White Star, she still felt regretful that the duel had ended in her untimely demise. She had hoped it would not have been a duel to the death, but that White Star could give her advice as a member of the Witenagemot after she had lost the duel. But alas, the mountain gods had had different plans for her.\n\nThe vast funeral procession left the citadel of High Mane, following a group of monks who carried White Star's black casket. The sun had set, for it was custom to bury the dead during the night, so ten thousand torches carried by ponies illuminated the escort. Honoria walked beside the coffin, struggling to hold back tears. All of a sudden she felt like she had killed White Star herself, even if that was not the case. In the end, it was her fault that White Star had died.\n\nThe procession travelled through the town and beyond, reaching a series of funeral mounds of the Star dynasty. One freshly prepared mound was open, waiting for its occupant to arrive, laden with burial goods. Ponies had brought countless valuable treasures to White Star's tomb to accompany her in the afterlife. As the casket was carried inside the barrow, monks chanted mournfully and thousands of commoners weeped, as did Honoria. Finally, there was a loud thump as a heavy stone sealed the mound shut, forever."

wittenland.35.d:0 "Voliare was back at the dockside pub he and Honoria had visited after returning from their last venture, all those months ago. He was drinking alone, downing tankard after tankard of ale. He had heard the news that Honoria had lost the duel and remained alive, but he didn't expect her to care for him anymore after his betrayal. He felt like he should've been there, supporting Honoria and cheering her on. Maybe then she would've won. Initially he thought that her victory would've meant doom for Wittenland, but now he just imagined how happy Honoria would've been if she had defeated White Star and proven to Wulfric that even a former serf could become Queen. In the end, he realized he cared more about Honoria's happiness and dreams than of Wittenland and its ponies.\n\nHe downed another tankard.\n"Starting to get drunk yet, Voliare?" a familiar voice asked. Voliare almost choked on his ale in surprise and coughed loudly. "Honoria?"\n"That's my name, yes," she said and sat down opposite him. "Bring me as many tankards as you brought him!" she shouted to the waiter.\n"So... why are you back here again?" Voliare asked. "I imagined you would've left on another trading trip."\nHonoria chuckled. "How could I leave without my trusted companion, who always helms the ship?"\n"I imagined you didn't consider me your companion anymore, after I refused to support you in the duel."\nShe shrugged. "I realized that White Star is more than fit to rule, and I got to see Wulfric's furious face. Everything turned out fine. Let bygones be bygones."\n"I would still like to apologize. I swear I will never abandon you in your hour of need ever again."\n"I know you won't, friend." The waiter brought the tankards. "Now let's see who gets drunk first."

Much of the mage-nobility was also there, except for the most hardcore conservatives as well as King Wulfric himself. His refusal to attend the ceremony was met with outrage among the commoners and his manor in Calcrond had already been vandalized. But for Wulfric, White Star's passing was nothing more than a cause for celebration. He had made a mistake when he had supported her challenge for the crown all those years ago, but now it didn't matter. White Star was out of the picture and Wulfric would save Wittenland from the dangers of liberalism and rabble rule.\n\nIn High Mane, the vast funeral procession left the citadel of the town, following a group of monks who carried White Star's black casket.

Now, anyone could challenge the ruling monarch without having support from the Witenagemot, the winner of the duel could no longer be challenged immediately by someone else and lastly, the use of magical weapons was forbidden, as it was meant to be a test of skill and power. Of course, these new rules made her own victory against Wulfric invalid, but they also invalidated Wulfric's challenge, so in the end only her victory over White Star mattered. Thus her own legitimacy was secured.\n\nThe royal mareservant Dayne once again spoke to assembled unicorns, calling for any challengers to step forth. Honoria sat on her throne, eagerly waiting to see what ambitious and talented individual would wish to claim her crown for themselves. After a moment of silence, a pale red-bearded unicorn emerged from the audience and issued a challenge.\n\nIt was Voliare.\n\nHonoria's eyes widened and she almost leaped from the throne. "Voliare? What on earth are you doing?"\n"I am challenging you to a duel, your majesty."\n"But you have no magical skills or talent to speak of! You have no chance of winning!"\n"I do have a chance. I intend to save Wittenland from your rule, and I want to see if you truly still are my friend. Do you accept the challenge or not?"\nThe audience turned to look at her.

wittenland.38.d:0 "At first, Voliare simply stood, doing nothing. Honoria had no idea what he was plotting, and hesitantly cast a simple magic missile. It hit his leg, making him stumble and fall. He slowly got up, and continued to stand in place.\n\n"Voliare, what are you doing? You're supposed to fight!"\n"I expect you to surrender, because I have no such intent myself. I will stand here till I am dead, or you have lost. You will continue your reign of tyranny only when you have proven that our friendship is truly gone for good."\n\nHonoria's confusion slowly turned into anger. First Voliare abandons her when she needs him, and now this? She was no tyrant and was certainly a better ruler than White Star had been, bringing true justice to Wittenland and purging the ranks of the Witenagemot. Yet here Voliare stood, defying her rule, demanding her to kill him if she wanted to remain Queen. How dared he abuse their friendship?\n\nHonoria clenched her teeth and cast another spell. Voliare winced in pain, his body ailing from the blast of magic, but continued to stand. This defiance only angered Honoria more, and she cast stronger spells, yet each time Voliare stood back up, and continued to stare into her eyes.\n\n"Voliare, I beg you, surrender!" Honoria said, her voice suddenly breaking. She didn't feel like hurting his former best friend any more. "I don't want to do this!"\n"And I don't want you to oppress ponies like me, who have no special skill or talent. Ponies who you have doomed to lives of poverty and misery."\n\nHonoria remained silent. There was truth in Voliare's words. She began to feel regretful, even shameful for everything she had done, ever since the fateful day when they had parted ways. "Voliare... please..." she said quietly, almost whimpering. Her horn glowed brigthly as tears flowed down her cheeks. Yet there Voliare stood, defying her until the end."

She had sat down on the marble floor, her head hanging low. Voliare approached him and offered her his hoof. "I only did this because I had to. I am sorry."\nHonoria lifted her head slowly and glared at him. "You used my feelings for you and took away my dreams and ambitions, yet still think we can be friends again? You moron."\nShe angrily slapped his hoof away, stood up and galloped past him, holding back tears of both anger and sorrow. Voliare did not go after her and helplessly watched as his former best friend ran away. Perhaps they would never see each other again.\n\nAfter rightfully winning the duel, Voliare was recognized as new King of Wittenland, and a coronation ceremony was prepared for him. However, he ordered it to be cancelled, and even more shockingly, announced that he would immediately dismantle the ancient monarchy of Wittenland. As both White Star and Honoria had completely defanged the Witenagemot, there was no one to oppose him in this act. Hesitantly, government officials and bureaucrats got to work to erase all traces of monarchical rule. Instead, Wittenland would become a democratic republic, and Voliare would be its first interim president. He had no experience in politics however and invited various advisors from abroad. Notably, many of them were socialists from River Republic or Bakara. With their aid, Voliare planned to bring freedom and equality to the ponies of Wittenland, who had suffered more than enough.\n\nYet he was not joyful when he liberated his nation from its shackles, but felt regretful about what he had done to Honoria.

POLITICS_HONORIA_DESC:0 "Honoria Goldmane was a serf bound to the land until she was freed by Queen White Star's reforms, who spoke fateful worlds that Honoria has never forgotten 'Any unicorn can achieve greatness'.\n\nShe quickly saw some success in trading products that were unappreciated by the nobility, and invested her entire savings into a trade mission to New Mareland, purchasing modern equipment to resell in Wittenland. Her initial ventures have grown, and she became suddenly wealthy.\n\nHonoria sees greatness in Wittenland's future, if only every unicorn can be freed to achieve their potential just as she has. She fumes over the oppression of incompetent nobles and believes Wittenland's meritocratic traditions can form the foundation of a truly just society, where only those fit to rule rise to the top."
POLITICS_WHITE_STAR_DESC:0 "Queen White Star is in many ways an exceptional mage-noble. Coming from a relatively unnotable family in High Mane, she genuinely cares for the common ponies, respects democracy and does not seek power for its own sake. She is ambitious, determined and has a strong will; those who argue with her soon realize what a futile effort it is. These make her a polar opposite to most mage-nobles, as well as her estranged brother, Silver Star, who is cowardly and power-hungry. Instead of defying his sister who condemned his dabbling in the dark arts, he fled and joined the Pentarchy of Barrad. Yet those who agree with White Star and her values soon learn how generous and caring she is, with a strong sense of empathy. It is no surprise she felt pity for her family's serfs and freed them, before deciding to become Queen and free all the other serfs of Wittenland as well.\n\nShe gained power the same way as every Wittenland monarch - by gathering the support of the nobility and issuing a challenge to the current monarch, who stepped down rather than face her in a magical duel. White Star is a skilled mage indeed, her determination making her a dedicated learner, always seeking to improve her abilities.\n\nA reformist, White Star is working to improve the antiquated society that has oppressed the common pony and enriched unproductive nobles. She has already implemented some key reforms, freeing peasants from serfdom and encouraging the expansion of the middle class. However, her greater ambitions of turning Wittenland into a true haven of liberty and prosperity remain uncomplete."
POLITICS_VOLIARE_DESC:0 "A former serf who took to a life as a smuggler on the rivers and coasts of east Griffonia, Voliare was a trusted companion of Merchant Captain Honoria. His life on the water instilled a certain egalitarianism in him - everypony is equal before the unforgiving waters.\n\nAfter witnessing the disastrous Honoria's challenge, he became an unlikely leader of the Wittenburgh uprising. Concluding that the Wittenland's pretensions about duels, meritocracy, unicorn supremacy was merely another tool of oppression, he works to overturn the entire Wittenland system and realise a world where all races must work together to steer the ship of state."
POLITICS_WULFRIC_DESC:0 "Wulfric of Cumricia is an old stallion, the head of a large and ancient noble family, and has been influential in Wittenland's politics for decades. He has always acted as an opponent to radical change and reform, but also thinks Wittenland has grown weak and complacent. This is why he backed White Star when she challenged the previous, decadent King, but soon began to regret this as the new Queen proved to be an ardent reformist, capable of outsmarting him time and again. Now White Star is dead and he has decided to take matters into his own hooves. If no one else can restore Wittenland's long lost glory and might, then he will. And he won't let anyone stand in his way. Especially the former serfs who have grown all too arrogant."

Legend says unicorns once raised and lowered the sun and moon, after all. Though we are unable to accomplish such a feat any longer, we can use our magic for various other purposes - both beneficial and harmful."
WIT_study_in_library:0 "Study In The Great Library"

WIT_lead_into_gold:0 "Lead Into Gold"
WIT_lead_into_gold_desc:0 "Transmutation spells have long been studied by alchemists, and by far the most useful spell is the one that turns lead, a fairly worthless metal, into shining gold. However, we must be careful with using this spell, as it results in inflation in the value of gold itself. In limited amounts, it can be an economic boon."
WIT_magic_mystery_cure:0 "Magical Mystery Cure"
WIT_magic_mystery_cure_desc:0 "With the use of magic, illnesses and wounds can be healed, and ponies saved from the brink of death. A potent nation-wide blessing is even more powerful than smaller healing spells used by individual mages."
WIT_disarray:0 "Confusion"
WIT_disarray_desc:0 "Some see mind-altering spells as immoral, but there is nothing wrong about using such spells on our enemies. With this powerful curse, we will cause havoc in the ranks of the enemy, making civilians lash out at each other and clouding the minds of their soldiers."
WIT_magical_automatons:0 "Magical Automatons"

WIT_they_shall_know_no_fear_desc:0 "The terror and stress of battle is often too much for soldiers to handle. If we use a mind-altering spell to dissuade such fears and make even the greatest coward bold and courageous, can it be called immoral? We don't think so."
WIT_blight:0 "Blight"
WIT_blight_desc:0 "It is widely believed that the best way to demoralize an enemy is by targeting their civilian populace. We shall do so by casting a curse on their crops and stored food, making plants diseased and rotten. Thousands will starve, but hopefully this will weaken their ability to wage war."
WIT_rust:0 "Curse of Rust"
WIT_rust_desc:0 "By casting a spell on the equipment used by our enemies, we can make it rapidly rust away. Rifles will malfunction and shatter, barrels of artillery guns will crumble into nothing and tanks will fall apart."
WIT_tame_ursas:0 "Tame Ursas"
WIT_tame_ursas_desc:0 "Ursa Majors are monstrous bear-like beasts composed of stardust who live in the caverns of our mountains. Long have they preyed on our ponies, but now it will come to an end. We will cast a powerful spell to subdue the minds of these beasts, making them obey our every command. We can then use them in battle against our foes."
WIT_tame_dragons:0 "Tame Dragons"
WIT_tame_dragons_desc:0 "The ancient mountains of Wittenland are home to dragons, who slumber on piles of treasure gathered over the centuries. The elder dragons are too mighty for our spells, but we can capture eggs from their nests and use magic to tame dragon whelps. We can train these young dragonlings and then unleash them in the field of battle against our enemies."

WIT_summon_falling_star_desc:0 "We might not be able to wrestle control of the Sun and Moon from the Equestrian Princesses, but we can pull a star down from the sky, making it land near the capital of our accursed enemy. It will cause widespread devastation and spread magical fallout, but will cripple our enemy."

They have been used for centuries and remained a well-guarded secret weapon, always feared by Wittenland's enemies. A Fire-siphon is a relatively simple pump with a nozzle, used to spray burning liquid simply known as "Wittenlandic fire". The ingredients of this incendiary and sticky substance are numerous and the full recipe is only known to Wittenlandic crafters, but it is known magic is involved in its production."
