### Political Tree ###

## Army Tree ##

WIT_Review_Wittenland_Military:0 "Review the Wittenland Military"
WIT_Review_Wittenland_Military_desc:0 "A brief assessment of our armed forces leads to the conclusion that our grand military is not only outdated, but woefully underequipped. The military is in dire need of a reform, as it follows an inefficient and old structure. A study into how we can adapt our military is the only course of action."

WIT_superior_firepower_focus:0 "Maelstrom Of Death"
WIT_superior_firepower_focus_desc:0 "In the magically oriented society of Wittenland, flair has distinguished an exceptional unicorn from the rest. It shouldn't be too difficult to adapt this concept for our grand military. The last thing our foes shall see are the most aesthetic, yet deadly explosions."

WIT_import_artillery:0 "Import Artillery From Abroad"
WIT_import_artillery_desc:0 "Having fallen behind on the development of artillery, it falls on us to learn from our allies, or would be rivals. Magic itself cannot replace years of study and development, but having an advanced, functional model of foreign ordinance would do wonders for our needs."

WIT_scrying_company:0 "Utilize Scrying Magic"
WIT_scrying_company_desc:0 "No pony mage, however talented he might be, can see the future. Those who attempted have gone mad, or simply wasted an extensive amount of effort. However, it is well within a decent mage's ability to see events transpiring on a distant location. If the ponies on the field knew what they faced in advance, they would have a greater success rate."

WIT_offensive_infantry_training:0 "Offensive Infantry Training"
WIT_offensive_infantry_training_desc:0 "Although Wittenland prides itself on its numerous mountain holds which have repelled numerous invaders, primarily the vicious Cossacks of the south, warfare has changed and a grand defence cannot win a war on its own. Let us stop hiding behind ramparts and charge our foes, horns blazing."

WIT_overcharged_rifles:0 "Overcharged Magical Rifles"
WIT_overcharged_rifles_desc:0 "Among the nations of the Riverlands, Wittenland was the first to came up independently of the idea for magically infused weaponry. Soon after came the first successful prototype to be used in the field. Following the request from the high command, our engineers will work out a method in making the rifles more powerful, without greatly compromising its reliability."

WIT_anti_tank_tactics:0 "Purchase Anti-Tank Weaponry"
WIT_anti_tank_tactics_desc:0 "Tanks have already made their impact on the battlefield, and their usage is rapidly spreading. Magical rifle shots bounce off armour plates, regular artillery is too inaccurate to counter them. Once more we shall turn to foreign inventions to close the gap in our knowledge, so that we may always be prepared for what we face on the field."

WIT_grand_battleplan_focus:0 "A Bulwark Of Stone And Steel"
WIT_grand_battleplan_focus_desc:0 "Citadels built from mortar and stone may have gone out of fashion, but the idea of a defensive doctrine itself remains relevant. Wittenland needs to merely modernise its existing knowledge and strategies to remain an unassailable fortress no lesser foe shall overcome."

WIT_mandatory_magical_training:0 "Mandatory Magical Training"
WIT_mandatory_magical_training_desc:0 "While it is not possible to have an army made fully of unicorns, we can make strides in expanding the training unicorns go through. To give them more options, to cast complex spells while in the heat of combat, that is the mark of a disciplined soldier, and we would greatly benefit in increasing our standards."

WIT_healing_magic:0 "Recruit Mage Healers"
WIT_healing_magic_desc:0 "Restorative magics are a woefully underappreciated branch of the arcane spectrum. It is rare to find unicorns with the aptitude and desire to specialise in it, but we believe we can spread this knowledge so that a greater number of ponies are able to utilise it. Nothing needs more healers than the army itself, as well."

WIT_mage_engineers:0 "Magical Engineering"
WIT_mage_engineers_desc:0 "A sufficient mastery of the arcane can adequately replace physical hoofwork. That is to say, shovels and satchel charges would become less important, as a corps of skilled magically trained engineers would replace "ordinary" engineers. Of course, a full conversion would not possible, but it is something we should be very interested in looking towards."

WIT_modern_fortifications:0 "Modern Fortifications"
WIT_modern_fortifications_desc:0 "Much like how an old castle has its rings of walls, modern defences have many trenches, nested bunkers, mines and lines of barbed wire and machine guns. To adequately protect our proud home, investment should be given towards fortifying crucial areas of our nation. The question is, where to start?"

WIT_mountain_combat_mastery:0 "Mountain Combat Mastery"
WIT_mountain_combat_mastery_desc:0 "Unlike other Riverland nations who rely on professional corps of pegasi, inspired by the Nimbusians, Wittenland's pride lies within its mountaineers, who are able to traverse difficult terrain to place themselves in an advantageous position. Further training and accolades should be given to them, so that they can remain at the top of their profession."

WIT_expand_crystal_mines:0 "Expand Darnish Crystal Mines"
WIT_expand_crystal_mines_desc:0 "Crystals are a much needed resource in a society such as Wittenland's. A necessary component in magical experiments, recent innovations have uncovered an efficient method of balancing the frequencies between spells and crystals themselves, resulting in an harmonic resonance. Mines will have to be dug deeper to satisfy the demand for more crystals."

WIT_revive_palatine_schools:0 "Revive Palatine Schools"
WIT_revive_palatine_schools_desc:0 "In the ages long past, the Palatine Unicorn Guard accompanied Wittenland's monarch on military marches. Renowned for their unyielding defensive tactics and almost impregnable magical shields, they became infamous for attempting to play kingmaker during a troubled time. Although we have no need for such a force, their strategies are worthwhile to introduce again."

WIT_expand_excubitors:0 "Expand The Ranks Of Excubitors"
WIT_expand_excubitors_desc:0 "Formed the replace the decadent and lazy Palatine Guard, the Excubitors are Wittenland's premiere fighting force, battle-hardened against the many Cossack attacks. Their presence among the supporting battalions could lift the heart of any forlorn pony. Their numbers have shrunk over the years, and we believe the Excubitors could use a much needed revival."

WIT_crystal_crafting_mastery:0 "Crystal Crafting Mastery"
WIT_crystal_crafting_mastery_desc:0 "Crystals are a natural medium for storing spells due to the similar frequencies both possess. Yet, they are incredibly fragile and require a master spellweaver and crystalblower to avoid shattering during the transfer. Their skills are a closely guarded secret earned by years of work, but it is necessary in this age to spread the knowledge wide."

# End
WIT_Military_End_Bonus:0 "The New Wittenland Standing Army"
WIT_Military_End_Bonus_desc:0 "Our reformed, modern army is unmatched! Every soldier is proud to serve in the Wittenlandic army and morale is at an all time high. However our special mountaineer squads should have a dash of flair, something to have them stand out. Equipping them with the latest magical infantry equipment will make them the new elites in our army."


## Navy
WIT_Navy_Start:0 "Landlocked No More"
WIT_Navy_Start_desc:0 "Having secured access to the sea, but more importantly, ports and dockyards, we shall establish the Wittelandic navy."

WIT_Destroyer_Tech:0 "The Destroyer Development Initiative"
WIT_Destroyer_Tech_desc:0 "Our newly developed navy means we cannot compete with the older, traditional naval forces like Bakara and the zebras. For now, we shall focus on building destroyer models that will harass the enemy at sea."
# Credit to Captain for Cruiser desc
WIT_Cruiser_Tech:0 "A Cruiser to Cruise the Seas"
WIT_Cruiser_Tech_desc:0 "We shall develop our screening vessels and heavy cruisers, giving our unicorns at sea better protection from small enemy ships and more bite against medium enemy warships."

WIT_Navy_Base:0 "A Home for the Fleet"
WIT_Navy_Base_desc:0 "Our ships require naval bases to restock, refuel and repair minor damage. We shall expand our existing ports and bases."

WIT_Battleship_Tech:0 "The Pride of the Navy"
WIT_Battleship_Tech_desc:0 "The battlecruiser will be the pride of the Wittenlandic navy! It shall ensure our dominance of the seas."

WIT_Dockyards:0 "One Rivet at a Time"
WIT_Dockyards_desc:0 "Our dockyards are insufficient for the increased naval demand. We have found several well positioned coastlines for the construction of new dockyards."

## Air
WIT_Air_Start:0 "The Wittenland Airforce"
WIT_Air_Start_desc:0 "We've always had a great view of the skies from our mountain castles, but now, with the invention of the airplane, the skies will be at our command."

WIT_Fighter_Tech:0 "Air Superiority"
WIT_Fighter_Tech_desc:0 "To secure our control of the skies, a light aircraft shall be developed."

WIT_Bomber_Tech:0 "Death from Above"
WIT_Bomber_Tech_desc:0 "In olden days, the battlemages have unleashed fiery destruction on our foes, but they couldn't put that to a reliable large scale use. The tactical bomber will fit this role and leave our sorcerers to use their magic in a smaller, more practical way."

WIT_CAS_Tech:0 "Multi-Role Aircraft Development"
WIT_CAS_Tech_desc:0 "Our troops require precise air strikes to take out targets. A specialized aircraft will be built to perform such incursions."

WIT_Air_Base:0 "The Roost"
WIT_Air_Base_desc:0 "All our new planes require more hangars. We shall clear fields and convert some of our mountain holds for this task."

WIT_Rocket_Tech:0 "To Boldly Go"
WIT_Rocket_Tech_desc:0 "With these new experimental rockets, we shall unleash destruction on our foes!"

#### EVENTS ####
wittenland.1.t:0 "The Springfield Festival"
wittenland.1.d:0 "Queen Whitestar cut the banner announcing the start of the Springfield Festival and the festival season in Wittenland. Hooves stomped in approval, whilst conservative nobles picked through the lower classes, barely masking their distaste.\n\nWhite Star smiled. Attending a smaller festival in Ivanhorn, instead of the lavish square of Wittenburgh, has been an inspired choice. Lord Wulfric was furious. He had already been grumbling about the burdens placed upon him by granting additional peasant rights, and now he was forced to stand with serfs and new money to attend alongside the Queen.\n\nShe briefly frowned, considering the problems it might cause, and then brightened. The River Artificers Guildmaster was drinking wine, standing by a table laden with some of the finest produce of the harvest season. A little suggestion here and there, a trade concession or two, and Wulfric would find himself difficulty in getting priority shipping over some of the newer merchants from the lower classes. Wulfric would understand immediately. He knew the game as well as anypony.\n\nQueen White Star took a sip of wine as she approached the Guildmaster. This would be a long, but productive day..."
wittenland.1.a:0 "A strong start to the season."

wittenland.2.t:0 "The Gallant Gala"
wittenland.2.d:0 "Violins played as exquisitely dressed nobility crossed the marble floors of the Wittenburgh Gala Hall. Centuries old silverware sat alongside exotic foods from Equestria, Olenia and even Griffenheim.\n\nWhispers followed Queen White Star as she entered. There would be hell to pay for her little stunt in Ivanhorn, and here, surrounded by the most elite of Wittenland at the most exclusive ball of the season, she would find little support from her new friends amongst the middle classes.\n\nHer mareservant returned with a wine, taking an opportunity to lean close "My Queen, Steel Little has expressed openness to leaving the Count of Papalia to work with you, but I've urgent news. Lord Wulfric and two of the Counts from Buckthorn have secured exclusive trading rights with one of the new electronics manufacturers in Rijekograd."\n\nWhite Star turned in shock, before smiling as if she had mistakenly thought she had recognised someone as she hissed "What?! How? Those contracts were supposed to be open bid!"\n\nShe calculated, her heart racing. Despite her previous successes, with the extra wealth and influence generated by these contacts, the conservative factions would be strengthened for years to come. Maintaining her existing reforms would be a battle, much less passing new reforms.\n\nHer thoughts were interrupted as a smiling Lord Wulfric held out his hoof. "May I have the pleasure of a dance, Your Highness?" White Star worked to keep her composure. With Wulfric hosting this year's Gala, it would be an egregious breach of courtesy to refuse the invitation..."
wittenland.2.a:0 "This is going to be a long evening."

wittenland.3.t:0 "The Great Debate"
wittenland.3.d:0 "The galleries of the Great Library listened attentively as Queen White Star outlined her plans for the year, with various nobles standing to make objections, comments and agreements. As usual, it was the topic of class reform that attracted the most attention. Drawing on the recent economic successes, orthodox Wittenland thought, and even the newer ideas of mavericks from Aquileia, Stalliongrad and New Mareland, she spoke at some length on the topic.\n\nLord Wulfric predictably rose, "Your Highness, these arguments are fine ones, but irrelevant. These societies are not magical ones like we are. These systems, though they may generate meagre prosperity among those who dig by hoof, are inferior to our ancient traditions where magical accomplishment and learning are wielded for the good of all. You yourself rose to power on this principle, yet now you would deny the very basis of your own rule?"\n\nWhite Star paused, choosing her words carefully. "We are not the only magical society, Lord Wulfric. Have you forgotten the magical rule of the Equestrian princesses? They find great value in equality and -"\n\nWulfric's horn glowed angrily as he thumped the table. "Those deluded alicorns who prance around and declare themselves Gods of Sun and Moon? They are neither a society of unicorns nor are they outstandingly magical. You put too much stock in the exaggerations of superstitious foreigners.""
wittenland.3.a:0 "The audience murmurs..."

wittenland.300.t:0 "The Great Debate"
wittenland.300.d:0 "The crowd murmured in agreement. A society as magical as Wittenland? At the very least, it was not something a Queen should publicly admit. \n\nWhite Star pursed her lips, persisting. "You may think so, but I have here a research paper, arrived last month from Canterlot University, reporting on the magical effects of a confrontation between Twilight Sparkle, the Element of Magic...." she paused to let it sink in "...and Lord Tirek, a Centaur who had stolen much of Equestria's magic."\n\nLord Wulfric snorted "Which merely proves my point! Element of Magic? Beams of energy larger than this very building?! No! This is the theocratic ramblings of a people who revere their alicorns as gods! You would devise policy not on wisdom, but fairy tale!"\n\nWhite Star made a crisp smile as she levitated a second scroll out "Indeed? Then perhaps you should speak with your staff. The modelling and measurements from Canterlot perfectly match the magigraph readings published by your very own magic monitoring station in Wittenburgh. Are the publications of your scholars also "theocratic ramblings", Lord Wulfric?"\n\nWhite Star allowed herself a rare grin as several nobles sniggered. "Perhaps if you spent less time defending your magical merit and more time staying abreast of recent magical developments, these "ramblings" would be less of an issue, hmmmm?""
wittenland.300.a:0 "I believe my case stands, Lord Wulfric."

wittenland.4.t:0 "The Derby"
wittenland.4.d:0 "Ponies laughed, cheered and roared as athletes raced, leaped and posed in displays of roller skating athleticism. Bets were made whilst nobles proudly posed for photographs with athletes from their territories and Wittenland's newest import - the radio - broadcast breathless commentary to ponies who eagerly huddled around display units in electronics stores.\n\nQueen White Star made her usual rounds, soothing egos, making promises and twisting legs as necessary. She was in an especially good mood, having convinced Thunder Amethyst, one of Witterburgh's finest tacticians, to consider employment with her.\n\nThe wine flowed freely (as it always did), and with the conclusion of the events of the day, the rinks were opened to the nobility. The children and more open minded grabbed at the opportunity eagerly whilst the older nobles looked on tolerantly.\n\nThen, to the surprise of everyone, White Star's nephew managed to tempt her out onto the rink as well, where she alternated between graceful twirls and giggling sprawls, with an infectiousness that soon spread, as others dragged parents, friends, and colleagues onto the rink. Even Lord Wulfric grinned patiently whilst his young granddaughter haltingly attempted to guide him on how to roller skate, despite her own obvious inability to make it more than a meter without slipping over.\n\nWhite Star paused to take in the scene, feeling a twinge of sadness."
wittenland.4.a:0 "This is how things should be."

wittenland.5.t:0 "Reclamation Day"
wittenland.5.d:0 "White Star adorned herself in the formal battle regalia of a Wittenland Spell-General, groaning as she did so. The land of festivals would not be complete without a celebration of the military, of course.\n\nBut did it really have to revolve around Coltstream? Like any politician, it was often her job to promise the impossible. And no promise was more impossible than the return of Coltstream. It was something in the water, she thought, nodding to herself. There was something that made the ponies of the Riverlands unusually stubborn.\n\nTwo hundred years ago, the River Republic managed to take Coltstream from Wittenland. And two hundred years later, here they were, still having a holiday to demand it be given back. She wondered if the last two hundred years of speeches had changed one bit, and briefly considered sending a request to the Great Library to check.\n\nTo her eternal annoyance,  it was the commonfolk who felt most strongly. The nobility understood power, understood the reality of politics. Yet every reform she made, every gift to the common pony, only served to increase their influence in demanding war. Fools! Who do they think would be charging into machine gun fire over this silly city? Certainly not the nobles!\n\nWhite Star sighed, and stepped up onto the podium."
wittenland.5.a:0 "Let's get this over with..."

wittenland.6.t:0 "The Grand Fair"
wittenland.6.d:0 "The Grand Fair overflowed with abundance. This year's highlights included: a magical self filling wine fountain, a demonstration gladiatorial round where veterans sparred and re-enacted great battles with griffon raiders (inevitably, some poor pegasi servants were roped into playing the Griffons), and a travelling troupe of Hippogriffon performers from across the seas.\n\nIn the middle of it all, White Star sat glumly. Despite her success in the debate, Lord Wulfric had capitalised on his new trading rights to cement several alliances and increase his influence amongst the nobility. She would undoubtedly face a choice between abandoning her reforms or facing a leadership challenge.\n\nSo when a runner delivered notes on the morning's trade, White Star did not look up until the usually taciturn Lord Wulfric uttered a curse and hurriedly excused himself from the festivities. Despite their propriety, White Star and the assembled nobles, could not help but curiously crowd around the runner. Even the Hippogriffon doing a surprisingly sophisticated double backwards somersault through a hoop whilst whistling the Wittenland national anthem failed to distract.\n\nWhite Star impatiently summoned a copy, reading. A successful venture led by Merchant Captain Honoria had returned from Equestria laden with high quality, competitively priced electronics, and with a Guarantee from a New Mareland bank underwriting further deliveries. \n\nShe began to laugh. Wulfric's monopolies on obsolete equipment were now an expensive disaster, another victim of the new money in a new world. \n\nSo distracted in her glee, she didn't notice the letter until her mareservant politely, but determinedly, levitated a letter inches from her face."
wittenland.6.a:0 "A letter?"

wittenland.600.t:0 "The Letter"
wittenland.600.d:0 ""My Queen,\n\nMy debt of freedom is repaid, and I hope the  success of my recent venture gives you the same deep satisfaction it has given to me. \n\nAs a former serf of Lord Wulfric's, I deeply hope his impending loss inspires him to stick his horn into one of his overpriced Rijekograd toasters and turn it on.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nMerchant Captain Honoria"\n\nWhite Star closed her eyes, smiling at this act of cosmic justice."
wittenland.600.a:0 "I must thank this "Honoria" in person."

wittenland.7.t:0 "Proving Day"
wittenland.7.d:0 "Queen White Star moved through the various podiums, as unicorns competed and demonstrated a variety of skills, from enchanting, multitasking, to brute telekinetic strength, displayed alongside examples of papers and scholarly endorsements.\n\nUnfortunately, savvy nobles, anticipating her visit, had already snapped up the best candidates. She took the opportunity to instead peruse recent imports of spellbooks, discovering a shopkeeper with some rather valuable trade connections.\n\nBest not to let such opportunities go to waste, she thought."
wittenland.7.a:0 "A quiet proving season."

wittenland.8.t:0 "New Mage Generals"
wittenland.8.d:0 "We have managed to poach several promising generals from the castles of High Mane and Wintershorn, both frontier areas that are known for their regular Griffon incursions. Unlike our recent work in magical proving, this has gone off without a hitch."
wittenland.8.a:0 "A magical army needs magical generals."

wittenland.9.t:0 "Magic Tank"
wittenland.9.d:0 "Queen White Star walked through the spotless workshop, as nervous workers cleared the way in their usually messy workspaces.\n\nThe company representative continued "As you know, armour enchanting is an extremely labour-intensive investment - the typical Wittenland pony is best served by a personal shield spell instead." He smiled. "However, this does offer up opportunities for heavier armour enchanting," He pointed to the prototype, a training model with newly welded plates of highly durable enchanted steel. "Just imagine, your majesty, a column of Griffon Knights expecting an easy battle and finding that even their vaunted heavy weapons simple do not dent our vehicles!"\n\nWhite Star nodded. "We will let you know if we have need of such a model.""
wittenland.9.a:0 "Magitech - Wittenland's future."

wittenland.10.t:0 "The Peasant Reformation Act"
wittenland.10.d:0 "Although it does not handle many broader fundamental questions of culture, role, and rights, the Peasant Reformation Act has been hailed by progressive scholars as a wide ranging economic reform, with careful attention to the details needed to empower peasants as part of a modern, skilled economy. Improvements are already being experienced, and further development is expected over the next two years."
wittenland.10.a:0 "Wittenland's ancient shackles loosen."

wittenland.11.t:0 "Completion of Peasant Reforms"
wittenland.11.d:0 "Contrary to the negative predictions of conservatives, the reforms have been a rousing success. The most recent quarterly report indicates that the reforms have continued to drive dramatic improvement, and Wittenland now ranks competitively with other industrialised nations on many metrics."
wittenland.11.a:0 "Magic and Modernity Together."

wittenland.12.t:0 "Military Review Commission Report"
wittenland.12.d:0 "[WIT.GetLeader],\n\nThe work of the Review Commission has identified two critical issues with Wittenland military capabilities.\n\n1. Modern combat is anticipated to revolve around contemporary rifles, hydraulically stabilised artillery, with specialist support. Our equipment in these areas lags behind major powers.\n2. Our military doctrine, based around castles and defence from Griffon raiders possessing more traditional weaponry, is ill equipped to the needs of the current era.\n\nFortunately, it is anticipated fixing these offers unique opportunities to use our magical expertise to improve on best practice elsewhere.\n\n. On this basis, our Great Library has reviewed our current knowledge on various military theories around the world, and suggested approaches for integrating these with a unicorn army and an accelerated technology program matched to it. The doctrines, and further data about the commission's work, are attached for review within.\n\nThe Wittenland Military Review Commission"
wittenland.12.a:0 "Modernised weaponry will guarantee victory."
wittenland.12.b:0 "We must evolve our defensive doctrine."

#POST DUEL EVENTS
wittenland.15.t:0 "Coltstream or War"
wittenland.15.d:0 "[WIT.GetLeader] reviewed the plans laid out before her, smiling. Finally, the day to reclaim Coltstream had arrived! No longer would the nobility bargain away the rightful lands of the unicorn race, lost due to incompetence 200 years ago. Coltstream will be great once more, and with one of the jewels of the River Republic in her hands, its wealth would be returned to its rightful, magical, owners."
wittenland.15.a:0 "Send the letter of demand."

wittenland.16.t:0 "Wittenland demands Coltstream!"
wittenland.16.d:0 "[WIT.GetLeader], the nationalistic leader of Wittenland and their deluded posse of unicorn supremacists, demand the return of Coltstream, taken from them 200 years ago.\n\nNaturally, the demand is absurd. Not only have we long since completely integrated Coltstream, but the city is just across the river from Rijekograd, and fairly distant from major Wittenland cities.\n\nHowever, the alternative may be war. What is our response?"
wittenland.16.a:0 "However unjust, we cannot risk a war."
wittenland.16.b:0 "If you have to ask..."

wittenland.17.t:0 "Coltstream is Returned!"
wittenland.17.d:0 "The occupiers have retreated, and we once more hold Coltstream. The strength of the unicorn race has proven its mettle."
wittenland.17.a:0 "Peace and Justice through Strength."

wittenland.18.t:0 "Our Demand is Rejected"
wittenland.18.d:0 "Though many hoped otherwise, the response is as expected - Coltstream will not be returned. Shall we declare war?"
wittenland.18.a:0 "Why demand if we don't follow through?"
wittenland.18.b:0 "Politics is more complicated than I thought...."

wittenland.19.t:0 "Wittenland Folds"
wittenland.19.d:0 "With the recent nationalistic rhetoric and change of leadership in Wittenland, many expected them to follow through on their promise of war Once again however, Wittenland's words have been revealed as the usual hot air. Maybe they can have another set of festivals to complain about it?"
wittenland.19.a:0 "Typical Wittenland behaviour."

wittenland.20.t:0 "Ending Ancient Grudges"
wittenland.20.d:0 "The documents are drawn up - Our claims on Coltstream shall be abandoned, peace achieved and we shall gain a generous cut of the river's trade income as compensation."
wittenland.20.a:0 "Let's try something new..."

wittenland.21.t:0 "A Surprise Proposal"
wittenland.21.d:0 "Wittenland, ever sour about their loss of Coltstream, has approached us with an unexpected proposal. They will end all claims to the territory in exchange for a cut of our trading revenue - "reparations", they call it. In the long run, the impact should be minor on us, and the terms are generous enough (at least given Wittenland's past stubbornness on the issue).\n\nHowever, this offer shames them, and their ponies will likely call for war should we worsen their shame by refusing."
wittenland.21.a:0 "Peace at last."
wittenland.21.b:0 "This is extortion!"

wittenland.22.t:0 "They agree"
wittenland.22.d:0 "The terms were accepted. Some of our patriots may grumble, but the flow of money to our coffers will ease injured pride"
wittenland.22.a:0 "No more Reclamation Day!"

wittenland.23.t:0 "They refuse"
wittenland.23.d:0 "Much to our surprise, the terms were rejected. A fresh insult on an old wound! The people are outraged, and prepared for war, should we demand it."
wittenland.23.a:0 "So much for a new leaf."

wittenland.25.t:0 "New Generals"
wittenland.25.d:0 "New generals have been recruited from the peasantry and some of the minor collaborationist noble families. Whilst they don't have the theoretical mastery of a well-trained academy unicorn, the civil war has seen many soldiers study in the unrelenting academy of civil war."
wittenland.25.a:0 "We will use them well."

wittenland.26.t:0 "The Raid"
wittenland.26.d:0 "Moods were high as the troops marched out. For hundreds of years Wittenland had endured ceaseless raids from the Gryphian Host, and finally, a chance to enact revenge had arrived.\n\nWielding our new equipment, troops moved swiftly in well-choreographed patterns across the field of the Host, digging temporary defences and setting up kill zones as they moved. Terrified Griffons were gunned down en masse. and our troops melted back into the mountains as quickly as they emerged.\n\nWhilst our generals expect the Gryphian Host to quickly adapt, celebrations have erupted across the border towns. Ponies speak with a new hope, as they consider victory instead of endless stalemate."
wittenland.26.a:0 "A credit to everyone involved."

wittenland.27.d:0 "In an colossal military disaster, Wittenland troops advanced onto our plains in carefully coordinated fashion, massacring civilians and soldiers alike with choreographed kill zones of machine gun fire and infantry support, melting away before our response parties could arrive.\n\nOur generals are already drafting new tactics to prevent such a disaster ever occurring again, but a more troubling possibility looms - a Wittenland on the offensive, with new weapons and new tactics."

wittenland.28.t:0 "The War for Coltstream"
wittenland.28.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Wittenland today declared war over the city of Coltstream, lost 200 years ago to the River Republic, after their demands for handover were refused.  Wittenland has protested the occupation of Coltstream for so long that even the nobility of Wittenland did not tend to take such requests seriously.\n\nHowever the new monarch [WIT.GetLeader] has led a nationalist campaign of transformation, tearing down the ancient power structures of the nobility, and creating a state based around the "natural superiority of unicorns". Many are concerned that such an aggressive move marks a radical change for Wittenland, as it signals ambitions for a "unicorn led empire""

wittenland.29.t:0 "The War for Coltstream"
wittenland.29.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Wittenland diplomats today announced the declaration of war over the city of Coltstream, lost 200 years ago to Rijekograd. Given the ancient nature of the claim, and the fact the Wittenland Communist government rejects the very concept of noble title, it is generally agreed that this is merely a flimsy, populist justification for Communist expansion.\n\nThe change springs from the recent death of reformist leaders Honoria and Queen White Star, an event that saw Communist revolutionaries overthrow the new conservative nobility."
wittenland.29.a:0 "Simple warmongering."
wittenland.29.b:0 "More squabbling in the Riverlands."

wittenland.30.t:0 "Coup in Wittenland"
wittenland.30.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Wittenland's ancient noble society was torn apart today, as in an unexpected twist, Queen White Star, widely regarded as a reformist and counterbalance to the conservative nobility, was defeated in a duel by Honoria, a merchant captain who had recently ascended from serfdom thanks to White Star's very own reforms.\n\nHonoria, who lacked noble backing, rushed to seize the palace and take families and nobles hostage, quickly securing military control.\n\nHonoria has announced that the existing noble order will be torn down and replaced by "A society where any unicorn can become great!" Honoria's nationalist rhetoric and focus on unicorn superiority seems to spell hard times for non-unicorns in Wittenland."
wittenland.30.a:0 "The Riverlands are forever changed...."

wittenland.31.t:0 "Civil War in Wittenland"
wittenland.31.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Chaos has erupted in the ancient unicorn society of Wittenland, as two powerful reformists, Queen White Star of the nobility and Honoria of the nouveau rich, were killed in a duel for the crown. Conservative Lord Wulfric ascended to the throne shortly after, announcing the repeal of all new rights granted to the serfs of Wittenland. The serfs have responded with mass uprisings, led by former farmer Voliare.\n\nDenouncing the duels and power struggles as a tool of oppression, the uprising has called for a society where all races and all classes shall be equal as workers."

wittenland.32.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]In a dramatic end to the political manoeuvrings of Wittenland's unicorn elite, reformist Queen White Star was a favourite against potential conservative challenger Lord Wulfric. Wulfric however, refrained from making a challenge, and White Star was challenged instead by Honoria, a newly wealthy merchant freed from serfdom by White Star's own reforms.\n\nDespite this twist, White Star was victorious, and Honoria swore loyalty to the Queen and her cause of class reform. With White Star's power secured, observers expect continued modernisation and peace among the Riverlands."

### THE DUEL ####
wittenland_duel.1.t:0 "Queening"
wittenland_duel.1.d:0 "The doors of the Royal Palace opened as Wittenland's most powerful unicorns strode into the Great Hall. The formal hearing of the challenges was a sacred Wittenland tradition - the foundation of their meritocracy, where anyone of magical skill and learning could become the new monarch.\n\nAnd on it's throne, White Star sat, calming her nerves. No amount of skill could make a duel safe for either side, and her safety relied more on expedience than skill - a defeat would be politically devastating for Wulfric, and even should he win, the nobility might ignore his demands. Perhaps even worse for Wulfric, she could simply step down and grant him the throne, assemble her supporters, and return in strength later.\n\nHer mareservant addressed the crowd "The Queen issues a call - let any who feel they have the backing of the nobility and the magical skill to take the Crown step forward." There was a small commotion at the back of the crowd, but no one spoke. White Star relaxed. Likely a young hothead mage who had just been restrained by his peers. "Let it be noted that the Queen continues her rule as the legitimate, unconte-"\n\n"I accept the call!"\n\nWhite Star looked to Lord Wulfric, who appeared just as surprised as she was.\n\nA mare pushed out of the crowd "I, Honoria, Merchant Captain of the Honoria Trading Concern, challenge Queen White Star for the throne!""
wittenland_duel.1.a:0 "Lord Wulfric began to laugh."

wittenland_duel.2.t:0 "Advanced Pawn"
wittenland_duel.2.d:0 "Lord Wulfric laughed, "The serf challenges the very Queen who freed her? I warned against radical change, but even I could not imagine such a poetic demonstration of your folly!"\n\nHonoria cut Wulfric a glare, "My Queen. Wulfric is a parasite. I am proof of the strength bound in every unicorn. Years ago, when you passed your reforms, you spoke. You told us that any unicorn could become great, be they noble or commoner.\n\nI stand here, having risen to a wealthy merchant, outcompeted the very noble who once controlled my chains. How much did his vaunted education and bloodline help him against a serf? I owe you everything." she bowed deeply before White Star, a sincere gesture of supplication. "And now, having destroyed Wulfric's wealth, your reforms are safe, my debt is paid, and I come to prove the truth of your words."\n\nHer horn crackled with brilliant display of light, her voice rising "You are wise, but weak! You could not defeat Wulfric without me! You allow the ponies of Rijekograd to rule our lands and offer nothing but empty promises! For all your opposition to the rights of the nobility, you beg for their favour! I shall bring about a land where all unicorns live as they were meant to - free to achieve their rightful mastery over this world!""
wittenland_duel.2.a:0 "What idiocy."

wittenland_duel.3.t:0 "Double Check"
wittenland_duel.3.d:0 "White Star spoke "Bold words, Captain, but there is more to rulership than ambition and financial talent. I have no need to hear the challenge of someone who cannot unite others behind her." She gestured to her guards, who moved forward to apprehend Honoria. Instead, they found a small group of merchants blocking their way.\n\n"I do not stand alone, White Star. A new generation of unicorns stand with me!"\n\nWhite Star paused briefly, and then motioned her guards continue. By dismissing the importance of the very classes she fought for, she embarrassed her cause, but such was politics.\n\nAnd yet again, the guards stopped, risking White Star's wrath. For Lord Wulfric blocked them, flanked by several members of the conservative nobility. "I will support Honoria's claim to the throne!"\n\nShocked gasps rippled through the crowd quickly followed by awe at his cleverness.\n\nShould Honoria ascend the throne, the nobility would quickly depose her, and with the scandal of Queen White Star defeated by her own freed serf, her cause would collapse, leaving Wulfric to ascend the throne.\n\nAnd should Honoria lose, White Star would prove the supremacy of the nobility even as her actions to dismiss the challenge branded her a hypocrite."
wittenland_duel.3.a:0 "He dares!"

wittenland_duel.4.t:0 "Forced Move"
wittenland_duel.4.d:0 "White Star froze in shock, her politician's mask fell away. Her entire work, undone by this... this... insanity? Lord Wulfric smiled, and a fury rose up in her. A righteousness, that had been crushed under years of fake smiles, insincere promises and slimy compromises. Her mane began to swirl, glowing with tongues of flame, and her silks began to smoke as a vortex of flame crept up her horn.\n\nThe crowd began to back away. This would be no civilised duel of safe formality, but a violent conflict of magical prodigies.\n\nHonoria hesitated, then set her jaw. "I wish it were otherwise, My Queen, but know this! When I win, I shall see your legacy of equality made real!"\n\nWhite Star merely screamed in fury, leapt from the throne, a swirling vortex of flaming marshmallow and finery"
wittenland_duel.4.a:0 "Ponies began to flee."

wittenland_duel.5.t:0 "Queen's Gambit"
wittenland_duel.5.d:0 "White Star's leap caught even Honoria by surprise, who narrowly dodged a faceful of burning undergarments hurled by the flaming Queen. But this was merely the prelude, as a large blast of fire, anticipating the dodge, roared forth from White Star's horn towards Honoria.\n\nHonoria had no choice but to hastily erect a magical shield, pouring valuable energy into her defence."
wittenland_duel.5.a:0 "The shield skilfully absorbs the flame."
wittenland_duel.5.b:0 "Both pour magic into the clash."
wittenland_duel.5.c:0 "The shield nearly buckles under the strain."

wittenland_duel.6.t:0 "Gardez"
wittenland_duel.6.d:0 "Though valuable magical energy was spent, the shield held, and Honoria, recovering from the initial fury, backed away, casting carefully. Waterspouts, droplets and mists of water converged from across the room towards White Star, as the air was sucked dry, the water of ornamental fountains rising to mix with yellow globs of champagne.\n\nWhite Star simply grew angrier pulsing with heat, sizzling the water around her to mist.\n\nHonoria smiled, poured on more water, overwhelming the magical flames, as White Star faced an incoming wave of scalding water of her own creation. White Star was immune to her own magical fire. Not this kind."
wittenland_duel.6.a:0 "White Star boils away the attack with sheer heat."
wittenland_duel.6.b:0 "White Star wrestles for control over the water with Honoria!"
wittenland_duel.6.c:0 "White Star hides behind cover!"

wittenland_duel.7.t:0 "Dynamic Play"
wittenland_duel.7.d:0 "With the water attack handled, it was quickly becoming obvious that this was a battle of magical endurance.\n\nHonoria and White Star began conserving energy, firing energy bolts back and fourth, shielding and ducking. An foolhardy unshielded member of the audience was struck down and rushed to medical attention.\n\nHonoria decided to take a risk, making a short range, energy intensive teleport to attempt to flank White Star"
wittenland_duel.7.a:0 "White Star's shields are misplaced and she must teleport to escape!"
wittenland_duel.7.b:0 "White Star pours more energy into coverage for her shields."
wittenland_duel.7.c:0 "White Star responds quickly, moving and rotating her shielding!"

wittenland_duel.8.t:0 "The Final Move"
wittenland_duel.8.d:0 "The duel ended not with a secret move, or surprise twist. Instead, just as it had begun, White Star poured her energy into a fireball, and Honoria raised her shield. But this time, there was not enough magic to sustain the exhausted pair for long..."
wittenland_duel.8.a:0 "Honoria faces the flames."
wittenland_duel.8.b:0 "Honoria faces the flames."
wittenland_duel.8.c:0 "Honoria faces the flames."

wittenland_duel.9.t:0 "Blocked Pawn"
wittenland_duel.9.d:0 "Honoria turned away the flames, and then collapsed, magic exhausted.  White Star loomed, enough spark for a small flame to burn her alive.\n\nHonoria closed her eyes, accepting her death. Queen White Star had proven the strongest and fittest to lead. The nation would be in fine hooves.\n\nWhite Star paused, regarding Honoria's composed resignation, and White Star's brain began to consider once again. Wheels spun, gears clicked in her mind as possibilities played out, and the face of rage vanished as her usual unreadable smile snapped into place. She pulled Honoria to her feet.\n\n"Ponies of the court. Today, we have seen something astounding. A mere serf, freed from her shackles, overthrew Wulfric's electronics monopoly, mustered sufficient support to block the Queen's rejection, and almost succeeded in winning a duel for the crown. Wulric has had decades in order to achieve the same, and yet he has failed."\n\n"Why? Because he cannot understand that greatness is found in every pony, and grows best in those who must seek it, not have it handed to them. I, like Wulfric, feared that truth deep down, and thus I rejected Honoria's challenge. I am shamed, for in showing such skill despite her upbringing, she has proven her worth.""
wittenland_duel.9.a:0 ""Therefore, I offer Honoria the Crown!""

wittenland_duel.10.t:0 "Exchange"
wittenland_duel.10.d:0 "The crowd broke out in whispers as Honoria stammered, confused by this turn of events. White Star had won. She had proven the greatest. Why was she offering Honoria the crown?\n\nWhite Star, smiling, leaned closer to her face. Honoria blushed. She could feel White Star's body still radiating heat from fire magic...\n\nWhite Star frowned with annoyance and hissed in her ear "If you wish to leave this room alive, refuse the crown!"\n\nHonoria shook herself, clearing her head. Yes... right, that made sense.\n\n"My...My Queen, I must refuse. You have proven your strength, and this offer proves the sincerity of your commitment." She kneeled "I swear my fealty to you and your cause."\n\nHonoria rose and turned to the audience."
wittenland_duel.10.a:0 ""Long live Queen White Star!""

wittenland_duel.11.t:0 "Checkmate"
wittenland_duel.11.d:0 "White Star's magic was exhausted, and with it her magical protection. She screamed, burnt alive by her own flames. Honoria and nobles alike gasped, appalled at the site.\n\nLord Wulfric stepped forward. "The court recognises Honoria, new Queen of Wittenland." He smiled "The niceties satisfied, I and my brethren withdraw my support for her, and chall-" He halted as one of Honoria's retinue pressed a pistol to his head, hissing "Idiocy! Shoot me and you and your retinue will be killed." Other nobles threw up shields, preparing for battle.\n\nHonoria sat down on the now empty throne. "No doubt, but so too will others" She levitated a radio for all to hear, switching it on. A filly sobbed "Help me, grandpa!" Wulfric stared at Honoria, shock and loathing battling across his face.\n\nHonoria addressed the nobles. "My guards have taken the guest wing. Your families live at my mercy. You will pledge loyalty to me, be escorted out of the palace, and announce your support to the people. Only then will your families be released."\n\nWulfric calculated furiously, before bowing. "You have my oath. But hurt a single pony in this palace and I would burn the palace to the ground to destroy you"\n\nHe turned to the audience."
wittenland_duel.11.a:0 ""Long Live Honoria, rightful Queen of Wittenland!""

wittenland_duel.12.t:0 "A New Order"
wittenland_duel.12.d:0 "Wulfric was escorted from the room. One by one, each noble bowed, pledged fealty, and was escorted out. The crowd shrank as Wittenland's most powerful swore fealty to the Peasant Queen. When it was finished, Honoria followed the departed nobles outside.\n\nShe stared with satisfaction at the piled corpses. Lord Wulfric's dead eyes stared at her, his last expression that of shock at her sudden but inevitable betrayal.\n\nThe rotten core of Wittenland had been purged. Now every unicorn would be free to realise their potential as masters of this world, just as Honoria did."
wittenland_duel.12.a:0 "Unicorn equality. Finally."

wittenland_duel.13.t:0 "Stalemate"
wittenland_duel.13.d:0 "Honoria's shield failed, and the fireball reduced her to ash. Exhausted, White let her magic flicker, and with the split-second drop of her own elemental protections, she screamed, burned alive as she was consumed by her own fire magic.  The crowd stared in horror. A death in duelling was rare enough, but two? This was a disaster. Honoria's retinue backed away and fled, and the palace guards stood unsure what to do.\n\nLord Wulfric stepped forward. "This barbaric display is White Star's doing. She pretended civility, but beneath it lay brute rage. And now she lies dead, killed by one of her own freed serfs."\n\nHe swept his gaze across the crowd. "Her reforms were mad, and this is the proof - self-immolation in the palace? Jumped up electronics sales ponies thinking they can run a nation? Our ancient traditions stained with blood and barbarism?"\n\n"All here know that I was the favoured candidate should White Star fall. I now take her mantle. Are there any challenges?" The room stood silently.\n\n"Then as my first act as King of Wittenland, I announce the repeal of White Star's reforms. Our ancient glory shall be preserved!""
wittenland_duel.13.a:0 "A toast to the new King!"

wittenland_duel.14.t:0 "A New Kind of Party"
wittenland_duel.14.d:0 "Across the land, the radio announced the news. The old ways would return. The freed serfs would resume their labour. New financial ventures and firms would be reabsorbed into the estates of the ancien regime.\n\nAs the cheering nobles drank the last of their champagne, celebrating the new King and the end of the festival season, a strange new unity spread across Wittenland as old grudges were put aside. But it was not the kind of unity King Wulfric had expected.\n\nThe new merchant class marched alongside their workers. Unicorns took up arms alongside non-unicorns. Ponies even fought alongside griffons. For everyone, even the lowest of the low, had tasted the fruits of White Star's labour. They had tasted freedom. And they would not yield.\n\nPonies stormed the Wittenland broadcast station and a new message rang out. "My name is Voliare. I was freed by White Star and saw the nobility oppose her. I stood by Honoria when she stood against their cruelties. And now both lie dead having tried to play the games of the nobility. We will not forget these heroes, and we will learn from their mistakes. There will be no crowns, no duels, and no nobility. Only the united equal workers of Wittenland!""
wittenland_duel.14.a:0 "Let's show these nobles\nwhat a real party looks like!"

#LEADER Desc
POLITICS_HONORIA_DESC:0 "Honoria was a serf bound to the land until she was freed by Queen White Star's reforms, who spoke fateful worlds that Honoria has never forgotten 'Any unicorn can achieve greatness'.\n\nShe quickly saw some success in trading products that were unappreciated by the nobility, and invested her entire savings into a trade mission to New Mareland, purchasing modern equipment to resell in Wittenland. Her initial ventures have grown, and she became suddenly wealthy.\n\nHonoria sees greatness in Wittenland's future, if only every unicorn can be freed to achieve their potential just as she has. She fumes over the oppression of the nobility, and her fellow Wittenlanders who suffer in Coltstream, something she blames White Star's passive policies for."
POLITICS_WHITE_STAR_DESC:0 "Queen White Star gained power the same way as every Wittenland monarch - by gathering the support of the nobility and issuing a challenge to the current monarch, who stepped down rather than face her in a magical duel or face no support from the nobility.\n\nA reformist, White Star is working to improve the antiquated system of serfdom and fixed land titles that have oppressed the common pony and enriched unproductive nobles.\n\nShe has already implemented some key reforms, freeing many peasants from serfdom and allowing more productive nobles to expand their titles. However, her greater ambition - a complete package of land reforms, abolition of key rights of the nobility, and curtailing of the extravagant parties that dominate noble life - remain uncomplete."
POLITICS_VOLIARE_DESC:0 "A former serf who took to a life as a smuggler on the rivers and coasts of east Griffonia, Voliare was a trusted companion of Merchant Captain Honoria. His life on the water instilled a certain egalitarianism in him - everypony is equal before the unforgiving sea.\n\nAfter witnessing the disastrous Honoria's challenge, he became an unlikely leader of the Wittenburgh uprising. Concluding that the Wittenland's pretensions about duels, meritocracy, unicorn supremacy was merely another tool of oppression, he works to overturn the entire Wittenland system and realise a world where all races must work together to steer the ship of state."
