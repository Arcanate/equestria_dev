#### FOCUSES ####

### Political Tree ###

## Foreign Tree ##
WIT_Diplomacy:0 "A Changing World"
WIT_Diplomacy_desc:0 "The world changes and so must we. Our ancient castles are no protection when raiders carry artillery. Our magical developments promise a new era of magitech if only we can seize it. Meanwhile political manoeuvring continues behind the scenes of opulent parties..."

WIT_Fed_Diplomacy:0 "External Threats"
WIT_Fed_Diplomacy_desc:0 "The states of the River Federation eye each other suspiciously even as they speak of peace and unification. By turning our focus to the enemies of the River Federation, we can reassure our neighbours even as we arm for conflict."

#Host subbranch
WIT_Anti_Host_Propaganda:0 "The Southern Threat"
WIT_Anti_Host_Propaganda_desc:0 "The stalemate with Helquill and Longsword command most of the attention of the River Federation. But these states are a known quantity, and the strife in the Griffonian Empire prevents them championing any large crusades. We must remind the River Federation that both threat and opportunity lie in the exposed plains of the Gryphian Host and their endless raids against our ponies."

WIT_Defence_Against_Host:0 "Ancient Strategies, Modern Tactics"
WIT_Defence_Against_Host_desc:0 "Our ancient mountain castles and defensive magic have allowed us to weather, if not defeat, the raids of the Gryphian Host. Adapting these tactics to work with machine gun emplacements and artillery can make this time-honoured tactic more deadly to attackers than ever before."

WIT_Attack_Against_Host:0 "Killing Fields"
WIT_Attack_Against_Host_desc:0 "The musket has been a poor weapon on the vulnerable open plains against the mobile raiders of the Gryphian Host. But technology now favours us, as long range rifles, trenches, artillery, and vehicles offer new tactical opportunities. The plains which have long protected our enemy shall become our killing fields."

WIT_Host_Forts:0 "The Modern Castle"
WIT_Host_Forts_desc:0 "Our mountain castles have always provided security, even as we have often been forced to allow raiders to roam outside, ransacking our towns and villages. By building a line of concrete, barbed wire, and machine guns, our borders shall become a new castle wall - one that leaves nothing for the raider."

WIT_Raid_Host:0 "Raid the Raiders"
WIT_Raid_Host_desc:0 "Defence has never been a problem for us. The problem has always been the ability of the Gryphian Host to melt away into their vast plains afterwards. But with modern equipment and tactics, a counter-raid could take the Gryphian Host by surprise, killing every griffon we encounter even as we maintain a line of retreat."

WIT_Attack_Host:0 "Operation Party Crasher"
WIT_Attack_Host_desc:0 "Whether we grind them down against our fortifications or advance en masse across their plains, victory is finally a possibility. With the defeat of the Gryphian Host, never again shall we have to fear the griffon menace at our doorstep. Let's finish this - once it’s over, we'll throw the greatest party in pony history. "

WIT_Core_Host:0 "In the Shadow of the Mountain"
WIT_Core_Host_desc:0 "The new vast plains we have secured present a challenge to hold and assimilate. Fortunately, our ancient castles and modern bases, once for protection, shall now serve as administrative and military hubs from which we can control the adjacent states."

#Barrad Subranch
WIT_Maneuvers_Near_Barad:0 "Magical Exercises Near Barrad"
WIT_Maneuvers_Near_Barad_desc:0 "Barrad is a blight on our history - a breakaway haven for dark spellcasters who use their powers for evil that we have been unable to dislodge. Mass unicorn on unicorn spell battles are tricky affairs - training manoeuvres with our divisions will ensure we are ready."

WIT_Barad_Forts:0 "Enchanted Fortifications"
WIT_Barad_Forts_desc:0 "Rumours have reached us of the situation worsening in Barrad, as their rule grows even more twisted. We must prepare the borders. Stout fortifications may seem little protection against dark horrors, but with a little magical tweaking from our spellcasters they can help us against the magical and mundane alike."

WIT_War_Barad:0 "Assault on The Black Tower"
WIT_War_Barad_desc:0 "The breakaway magocracy of Barrad is a blight on Griffonia and our greatest shame, putting the name of unicorn spellcasters everywhere into disrepute. We must recover our ancestral lands, purge it of evil, and right the great wrong from so long ago."

WIT_Core_Barad:0 "Purify the Blight"
WIT_Core_Barad_desc:0 "Barrad is ours! Now begins the painful task of purifying the land and freeing its inhabitants, turning it into a place where good ponies can once again dwell."

WIT_Forbidden_Vaults:0 "Forbidden Vaults"
WIT_Forbidden_Vaults_desc:0 "Our workers have encountered vaults of the magocracy filled with the forbidden knowledge and dark science. Much of it may have to be destroyed, but some could surely be put to good use... couldn't it?"

##end Foreign Tree

#Magic Studies
WIT_Study_Magic:0 "Advanced Enchanting"
WIT_Study_Magic_desc:0 "Most magical military research focuses on the mass production of magic for simple, small weapons. But our advanced practitioners might be better used to perform intricate enchantments for a few powerful weapons instead."

WIT_Unicorn_Magic:0 "Unicorn Magic"
WIT_Unicorn_Magic_desc:0 "Wittenland is a land of unicorn spellcasters, and it is said that the best gift is a fine wine or a fine spellbook. With a little investment, we could speed up our magical development."

WIT_Natural_Magic:0 "Natural Magic"
WIT_Natural_Magic_desc:0 "It is commonly thought that a pony's magic comes from their horn. It is actually a deeper, more innate magic merely channelled by the horn. Our magical ancestry and ancestral lands are filled with this innate magic. We should realise its potential."

WIT_Best_Mages:0 "Magical Proving"
WIT_Best_Mages_desc:0 "Our nation respects magic and scholarship above all, and we must constantly find worthy candidates to join the ranks of government and elite casters. Queen White Star could invest time scouting local magical proving events, discovering promising candidates before they are snapped up by competing nobles"

WIT_Magical_Saturnalia:0 "Saturnalia"
WIT_Magical_Saturnalia_desc:0 "The Northern Lights are a common, if faint phenomenon in the cold lands of Wittenland. At the Saturnalia festival, skilled mages work to supercharge it into a dazzling light display to accompany lavish festivities. Sponsoring and organising this year's festival would help Queen White Star's prestige."

WIT_New_Archmages:0 "New Mage Generals"
WIT_New_Archmages_desc:0 "Magical armies are best led by magical generals, and it has been difficult to find candidates who are both magical and familiar with modern military thought. With some effort, we could poach some of the more promising leaders employed by other nobles."

#Celebrations and Internal Politics
WIT_SpringField_Festival:0 "The Springfield Festival"
WIT_SpringField_Festival_desc:0 " The Springfield Festival opens Wittenland's most lavish season of parties, as the largest annual harvests are completed, and the peasants and nobility alike have some respite from their other obligations. Although the festival is held every year, Queen White Star will need to be particularly involved this time if she wishes to push her progressive reforms."

WIT_Gallant_Gala:0 "The Gallant Gala"
WIT_Gallant_Gala_desc:0 "The most opulent, exclusive and formal of Wittenland's pageantries, the Gallant Gala is rife with intrigue and lobbying amongst the nobility. It is here that they are at their most powerful, and it is here that White Star will need to be if she is to check their grip over the common folk."

WIT_Great_Debate:0 "The Great Debate"
WIT_Great_Debate_desc:0 "The Monarch of Wittenland rules through consent, wisdom and magic power, not force. They are expected to persuade the nobility of the merits of their policies through rhetoric and reason. (or at least, hide the arm twisting behind the scenes) The Great Debate, though partly spectacle, is another challenge for Queen White Star's continuing reforms. "

WIT_Derby:0 "The Derby"
WIT_Derby_desc:0 "Though modern roller-skates are somewhat new to Griffonia, the ponies of Wittenland have taken to them like a seapony to water. The annual Derby will see roller-skaters from across the region compete, often sponsored by various noble patrons seeking prestige. The more relaxed atmosphere makes it a good venue for striking deals too..."

WIT_Grand_Fair:0 "The Grand Fair"
WIT_Grand_Fair_desc:0 "The Grand Fair is a lavish showcase of the artistic and entertainment capabilities of the nation.  Plays, music, entertainments of every kind, even gladiatorial combat.  Naturally, the spectacle means that important nobles will be there, jockeying for status."

WIT_Reclamation_Day:0 "Reclamation Day"
WIT_Reclamation_Day_desc:0 "In 803, the River Republika invaded our lands, captured Wittenburgh and marched on High Mane, where their treacherous Queen and her daughters fell sieging our stronghold. We pushed them back, though to this day they hold our city of Coltstream. On Reclamation Day every pony of Wittenland remembers the great sacrifices of our armies, and our unfinished duty - the reclamation of Coltstream."

### Three Ideologies ###
WIT_The_Duel:0 "The Duel"
WIT_The_Duel_desc:0 "Anypony with some backing in the court may challenge the monarch for leadership through a duel of mental prowess and magical mastery. If the challenger has sufficient backing, the monarch will often step down peacefully. With her expert political manoeuvring, Queen White Star has secured enough support to push further reforms empowering the common pony, and no challenges are expected this year"

# Neutral (Queen White Star wins duel)
WIT_White_Star_Triumphs:0 "White Star Triumphs"
WIT_White_Star_Triumphs_desc:0 ""

WIT_Ancient_Ancestry:0 "Ancient Ancestry"
WIT_Ancient_Ancestry_desc:0 "For hundreds of years, we have trained in magic for use in all aspects of life, passing its secrets down from generation to generation. Now others rush to integrate their magic into modern weaponry. \n\n We need not rush. We were born ready."

WIT_Loyalty_To_The_Queen:0 "A Queen of the People"
WIT_Loyalty_To_The_Queen_desc:0 "Monarchs always claim to rule selflessly for their people, but not all do. Queen White Star has proven her dedication to the people, and ponies have flocked to serve the Queen that serves them."

WIT_A_Greatful_Populace:0 "Complete the Reforms"
WIT_A_Greatful_Populace_desc:0 "The nobles have been won over or marginalised and all challengers defeated. No longer will Wittenland have its opportunity and potential squandered of a lavish life of unearned privilege. We shall always be a people of parties. But the true joy of a party is a humble joy - that of friendship, unity and cheer. Not of intrigue, exclusivity and expense."

WIT_Coltstream_Please:0 "Request the Return of Coltstream"
WIT_Coltstream_Please_desc:0 "Over 200 years ago, the River Principality launched a war of greed and ambition. Their last surviving Princess, recognising their foolishness, implemented a Republic as her last dying wish. We too, have become fairer, more equal ponies. Let us ask for the return of Coltstream - not as a monarch demanding a claim, but as fellow ponies righting an ancient wrong."

WIT_A_New_Generation:0 "A New Generation"
WIT_A_New_Generation_desc:0 "Honoria has proven the Queen's claim - Any commoner can achieve great things. This event is an opportunity to get a new generation of skilled specialists into vital fields."

WIT_Unity_Around_The_Queen:0 "A United People"
WIT_Unity_Around_The_Queen_desc:0 "White Star's success has unified the common pony behind us. We can put this support to good use."

# Fascist (UPP / Honoraria wins duel)
WIT_UPP_Takes_Power:0 "The Peasant Queen"
WIT_UPP_Takes_Power_desc:0 "We have fairly claimed the throne, and just as importantly, the key nobility of the nation are hostage here in this palace. The dream of Wittenland can be finally realised - a nation where every Unicorn, rich or poor, can see their true potential realised as magical masters of all."

WIT_Ready_For_Conflict:0 "Prepare for War"
WIT_Ready_For_Conflict_desc:0 "Wittenland is our home, our parent. Non-unicorns, monarchs, corporations - all would take it from us. We must be ready for them, and ready to reclaim our lost land of Coltstream."

WIT_Renewed_Militarism:0 "The Unicorn Way of Life"
WIT_Renewed_Militarism_desc:0 "Wittenland is unique - a nation of unicorns, where magecraft can be practiced for good, not bound in servitude to the needs of Earth and Pegasi ponies. We must remind our unicorns of the benefits of such a life, and the consequences if we do not act decisively to protect it."

WIT_Productivity_At_Last:0 "Parties Must End"
WIT_Productivity_At_Last_desc:0 "The incredible potential of a unicorn state has been spent on frivolities for the rich, even whilst the people suffered. Parties should be purchased with ones own hard earned money, not the public purse or aristocratic rents. All but the largest parties must end. Those that remain shall be turned into national holidays celebrating our unity and way of life."

WIT_Coltstream_Or_War:0 "Coltstream or War"
WIT_Coltstream_Or_War_desc:0 "200 years ago the ponies of the River Republika stole Coltstream from us. In response, the Queen and her three daughters fell by our hooves, yet we could never retake Coltstream. It is time to finish the job we started 200 years ago."

WIT_Our_Rightful_Place:0 "Spread the Magic of Magic"
WIT_Our_Rightful_Place_desc:0 "Magic rules this world. Yet none can wield it like unicorns can - shielding, teleportation, even time travel. The advantages of such a society are obvious. The unicorn is the best pony and the unicorn shall rule all, for the good of all."

WIT_Not_One_Step_Back:0 "Never Again"
WIT_Not_One_Step_Back_desc:0 "When we gave the small part of land to our north up to the River Republika, we lost it for 200 years. When we allowed the mages of Barrad to break away, we lost it for decades. The lesson is clear. Wittenland soil must never again fall beneath foreign hooves."

#Communist (Death of pro-preasant leaders leads to conservative noble rule and then commoner uprising)
WIT_Chaos_Ensues:0 "The Uprising"
WIT_Chaos_Ensues_desc:0 "In a supreme irony, the two champions of the people lie dead. The nobles rush to oppress ponies once more and take away our hard won freedoms. We shall not make the same mistake again - no more compromise, no more duels, no more unicorn traditions. The workers shall rule, and all shall be equal."

WIT_New_Leaders:0 "Officers of the People"
WIT_New_Leaders_desc:0 "Wittenland armies were led by noble unicorn mages, most of who lie dead or fight for the enemy. We must recruit new officers at once from the people."

WIT_Revenge_Incoming:0 "Enemies on All Sides"
WIT_Revenge_Incoming_desc:0 "We have finally thrown off the chains of oppression - no kings, no aristocracy. We must fortify the borders with to the north, lest others try to take our newfound freedoms."

WIT_Lessons_Of_The_Civil_War:0 "Parties for the People"
WIT_Lessons_Of_The_Civil_War_desc:0 "Stalliongrad Communism is a bit grim. What is the point of work if not to enjoy the fruit of its labour? Wittenland Communism shall replace the wasteful extravaganzas of the nobility with regular festivals and parties for the people. The food and decorations may be cheap and mass produced, but friendship, relaxation and cheer come from ponies, not production lines."

WIT_Coltstream_Is_Ours:0 "Liberate our Brethren"
WIT_Coltstream_Is_Ours_desc:0 "Now that we have united the country, the workers of Coltstream cry out for liberation. Queen White Star bowed to foreign companies and monarchs in her endless aristocratic games, leaving this injustice to stand. We shall take back what is ours."
#wittenland.29

WIT_Renewed_Fervour:0 "A People's Army"
WIT_Renewed_Fervour_desc:0 "Factory workers. Farmers. Non-unicorns. All suffered under the tyranny of a unicorn elite. Those who find equality under our new nation rush to protect it. "

WIT_Fuel_For_The_Fire:0 "Fuel for the Fire"
WIT_Fuel_For_The_Fire_desc:0 "Honoraria and the revolutionaries who followed have shown us the path - we must stand for our beliefs. Where others bicker and deliberate over injustice, we must march. \n\n Ponies of the revolution, forwards!"

#### Military

WIT_Review_Wittenland_Military:0 "Review the Wittenland Military"
WIT_Review_Wittenland_Military_desc:0 "A brief assessment of our armed forces leads to the conclusion that our grand military is not only outdated, but woefully inequipped. The military is in dire need of a reform, as it follows a wildly innefficent and old structure.\n\nA study into how we can adapt our military is the only course of action."

#LEADER Desc
POLITICS_HONORIA_DESC:0 "Honoria was a serf bound to the land until she was freed by Queen White Star's reforms, who spoke fateful worlds that Honoria has never forgotten 'Any unicorn can achieve greatness'.\n\n She quickly saw some success in trading products that were unappreciated by the nobility, and invested her entire savings into a trade mission to New Mareland, purchasing modern equipment to resell in Wittenland. Her initial ventures have grown, and she became suddenly wealthy.\n\nHonoria sees greatness in Wittenland's future, if only every unicorn can be freed to achieve their potential just as she has. She fumes over the oppression of the nobility, and her fellow Wittenlanders who suffer in Coltstream, something she blames White Star's passive policies for." 
POLITICS_WHITE_STAR_DESC:0 "Queen White Star gained power the same way as every Wittenland monarch - by gathering the support of the nobility and issuing a challenge to the current monarch, who stepped down rather than face her in a magical duel or face no support from the nobility.\n\n A reformist, White Star is working to improve the antiquated system of serfdom and fixed land titles that have oppressed the common pony and enriched unproductive nobles.\n\n She has already implemented some key reforms, freeing many peasants from serfdom and allowing more productive nobles to expand their titles. However her greater ambition - a complete package of land reforms, abolition of key rights of the nobility, and curtailling of the extravagant parties that dominant noble life - remain uncomplete."
