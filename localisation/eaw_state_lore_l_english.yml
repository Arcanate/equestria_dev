state_lore_text_container_state_description_75:0 "The great metropolis of §MManehattan§! has been bestowed many titles in the past - Caput Mundi; the Big Apple; the City of Dreams. With its satellites, §YHayston§! and §YBronclyn§!, this megacity on the §MEast Coast§! of Equestria is unrivalled in its splendor.\n\nThe glamour of its nightlife and citizenry, and its unassailable status as a locus of high culture, all belie the true roots of its wealth - its §Ymassive industrial base§!, located on the outskirts of the suburbs. If one should gaze to the west from the crown of the Mare Statue, they would glimpse the smokestacks and cranes that juxtapose a parallel skyline - albeit dull and grimy, yet no less impressive - against the opalescence of the skyscrapers downtown.\n\nThe core of the §YEquestrian Royal Navy§! - the §MCelestial Sea Fleet§! - is stationed in Manehattan. Where massive amounts of capital flow through the wharfs and dockyards of Bronclyn, from Griffonia, Zebrica, and §Ybeyond§!, the iron fist of maritime law ensures that the waters around the metropolis are kept safe, from threats both monstrous and mundane.\n\nNow, in the new millennium, new §Rideologies§!, §Rdemagogues§!, §Rdeities§!, and §Rempires§! threaten the city from without and within. Across the sea, §RGriffonia§! is poised for a decade of brutal conflict, and Manehattan's own §BLunarists§! grow more belligerent by the day, as the horrors of mechanized warfare encroach on ponies' nightmares. In the years to come, what fate will befall this city?\n "

state_lore_text_container_state_name_30:0 "The §YCity§! of the §YMoon§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_30:0 "There is a charm in the city of Ayacachtli that begets wonderous thoughts in anypony; here is a city, that was ancient before Equestria had even been formed. Located in the southern jungles, in the mountains on the border of Badlands, Ayacachtli has the dubious honour of being the oldest thestral city in the world. Legends hold it, that it was constructed by a thestral Moonspeaker with the aid of an Ursa Major. Historians, however, place its origins to many millenia ago, to the times when thestral tribes and the Neighua came into conflict and a need for a safe haven was born. Whatever it may have been, thestrals have been living in the city for so long, that only bare estimates can be given with current historical records.\n\nQuite an unusual aspect about Ayacachtli is the fact it is located inside the mountain range, inside a cast cavern dug over time by its denizens. Even as times have advanced, majority of the city is still located safely there, with just part of the more modern city located outside. Where, along with them, plenty of terraces for farming are located to feed the mountain city. But it is not food that Ayacachtli is known for; for the mountains contain many riches such as copper, silver and gold. Historians have traced many ancient trade routes leading to Ayacachtli from the north, carrying goods such as iron weapons and armour in exchange for the mined minerals. Evidence shows that Ayacachtli served as a vital link for trade between the jungles and north, through which luxury goods such as sugar and cocoa from jungle tribes passed by. Once the princesses proceeded with their formation of Equestria, Ayacachtli found itself in a favourable position - at least until the incident with Nightmare Moon occured. Now shunned, the thesrals returned to living amongs themselves, in fear of respitals and revenge for siding with the horrid monster that had once been their beloved princess. This especially hurt Ayacachtli and the city endured for centuries as but a hollow shell of a once mighty realm.\n\nToday, Ayacachtli stands as a testament for vigority of thestralkind, and perhaps the sole place where they may live as who they are without any fear for harasment or misstreatment. Near total-majority of its denizens is made up by thestrals. Even the ponies there are usually tribals from the jungles, who have interacted with the thestrals far longer than any northener has and even tend to share a common tongue with. Modernization is present in the city but mixed in to tradition and the peculiar aspects of thestrals; Ayacachtli has no real streets, as near-every denizen can fly. This has led to the city developing not horitzontally as a traditional city but primarily vertically. Tall towers, reaching from the cavern's ceiling to the floor, dot the vast cave, with the odd bridge crossing the gaps between them. Even with modern electricity, most of Ayacachtli is cast in but dim light, to better suit the sensitive eyes of thestrals. Further caverns extend out from the main one, which lead to the many mining tunnels; Ayacachtli even to this day is mostly dependant upon its ore exports to many Equestrian industries north; one could perhaps find some irony in how some things never change.\n\nCentral part of the city and an aspect that cannot be missed is the Temple of Moon, located at the city's center and remains a staunchly visited complex by the thestrals. It is the place where every Moonspeaker comes to learn the traditional ways and read the ancient texts stored within there. Some said to more than millenia old but no outsiders are permitted to see them, not even a certain Princess of Books. But what a visitor can see is already extraordinary, and a sight to rival even that of Canterlot. For right past its entrance, visitors are met with a giant dome covering the main hall. On this dome there is a vividly well-detailed star map, one born from countless generations of work from the Moonspeakers. Every possible inch of the carved stone accurately details the wonders of the night sky to the point that astronomers from Princess Luna's Academy of Stars have praised the meticulous work the priests have done, even rivalling achievements historical astronomers such as Galloping Galley and Leap Ordinance. There have been calls to preserve the temple complex for sake of history but for thestrals, however, the temple still serves its original purpose, as it did since its inception; to venerate the Moon, as their forebears did before them. A work that continues on, and will do so for more millenia to come."
