state_lore_text_container_state_name_75:0 "The §YCity that Never Sleeps§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_75:0 "The great metropolis of §MManehattan§! has been bestowed many titles in the past - Caput Mundi; the Big Apple; the City of Dreams. With its satellites, §YHayston§! and §YBronclyn§!, this megacity on the §MEast Coast§! of Equestria is unrivalled in its splendor.\n\nThe glamour of its nightlife and citizenry, and its unassailable status as a locus of high culture, all belie the true roots of its wealth - its §Ymassive industrial base§!, located on the outskirts of the suburbs. If one should gaze to the west from the crown of the Mare Statue, they would glimpse the smokestacks and cranes that juxtapose a parallel skyline - albeit dull and grimy, yet no less impressive - against the opalescence of the skyscrapers downtown.\n\nThe core of the §YEquestrian Royal Navy§! - the §MCelestial Sea Fleet§! - is stationed in Manehattan. Where massive amounts of capital flow through the wharfs and dockyards of Bronclyn, from Griffonia, Zebrica, and §Ybeyond§!, the iron fist of maritime law ensures that the waters around the metropolis are kept safe, from threats both monstrous and mundane.\n\nNow, in the new millennium, the city is threatened from without and within. Across the sea, §RGriffonia§! is poised for a decade of brutal conflict, and Manehattan's own §MThestrals§! grow more belligerent by the day, as the horrors of mechanized warfare encroach on ponies' nightmares. In the years to come, what fate will befall this city?\n "

It was once known as the workshop of the world, producing goods for export across the planet, and is famed for its medical school located beneath the pegasus district of Bells Air (commonly known as "Little Cloudsdale").\n\nOther notable features of the city are its all-unicorn police force and §RDragon Town§!, a district inhabited exclusively by dragons, as well as the yearly Grapefruit Festival. In recent years the city was struggling with a severe §Mparasprite§! infestation, which took years to clear out."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_2:0 "Ponyville, located next to the §GEverfree Forest§! southwest of Canterlot, was for most of its history an unremarkable rural settlement. The first pony inhabitants of the area were part of the §YApple Family§!, who were granted the land as a gift by §YPrincess Celestia§! herself almost a century ago. The first apple orchards were planted, but while the trees grew, the ponies discovered magical §MZap Apples§! inside the Everfree Forest. The jam prepared from these apples became famous, attracting many migrants. Stinkin' Rich, the grandfather of the entrepreneur Filthy Rich, opened a market selling the jam, which soon grew into a burgeoining business. The Apple and Rich families still live in the town to this day, and are honoured as its founders.\n\nIn the years since, many ponies have moved to Ponyville, making it a very diverse town. All three races are present and live together in harmony. It is for this reason why Princess Celestia sent her young pupil, §YTwilight Sparkle§!, to live in the town and make some friends. She and the ponies she met soon became close friends and the wielders of the §YElements of Harmony§!, who have saved Equestria from countless threats. After her ascension into Alicornhood and her defeat of §RLord Tirek§!, Twilight Sparkle now lives in the §MCastle of Friendship§! north of the town. Next to it, she has opened the §YSchool of Friendship§! which has students from all across the world. Despite its small size, Ponyville is known across Equestria as the haven of friendship and harmony."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_68:0 "There are several towns in Equestria which can only be inhabited by pegasi. Such towns are made out of clouds, which only pegasi can walk on, and float in the sky. §MCloudsdale§! is the largest such town, and is regarded as the capital of the Pegasi.\n\nIt is famed for its architecture, its tall pillars and high halls made entirely from vapor and held together by magic. It also has the largest §MWeather Factory§! in Equestria, for pegasi are responsible for weather management. The clouds, rainbows and snowflakes made in the town are distributed all across the nation. Another notable feature is the §YCloudeseum§!, where the annual Best Young Flyer competition is held. The town is also known to be the birthplace of §MRainbow Dash§! and §YFluttershy§!, wielders of the Elements of Loyalty and Kindness respectively."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_13:0 "Baltimare is the largest settlement in the Equestrian South-East, located in the Horseshoe Bay. Originally a small fishing settlement, it industrialized and grew rapidly, mostly thanks to its natural harbour. It became a center of shipping and manufacturing with thriving docks.\n\nHowever, the workers have been treated worse than in many other Equestrian cities. Because of this Baltimare became the center of the Equestrian labour movement, housing the headquarters of the CAN-TER anarcho-syndicalist federation of trade unions and anarchists. A large protest had been held in the city during the Winter Revolution in Stalliongrad, and the mayor of the city had been sacked by Celestia herself.\n\nDue to being located in the South-East, the city also houses a considerable minority of thestrals, whose conditions are even worse than that of the workers, but who are not allowed to join unions. Many Coltjuns from Hayseed Swamps inhabit the city as well."

In fact, the only inhabitant in the entire forest is Zecora, a Zebra shaman who lives in isolation. The other denisens of the forest are far less friendly than her.\n\nUnlike in rest of Equestria, weather and nature in the Everfree Forest are outside the influence and caretaking of ponykind. Clouds move on their own, gnarly and thorny plants grow without limits, and fearsome beasts stalk the shadows. Groves of Poison Joke and nests of Parasprites lure the unwary traveller to their doom.\n\nGetting lost in the Everfree Forest is the nightmare of any pony living near it. Those who dare to travel through it do it as quickly as they can and are prepared to fight for their lives. It is a magical, cursed place, and so far the advances of technology have provided no means to tame it."

It is a huge structure of stone and has almost completely broken down over the centuries. Once, Celestia and Luna lived there together, having established it as their capital. But those days of splendour ended when Luna was consumed by jealousy and became §RNightmare Moon§! who tried to slay her beloved sister. Much of the castle was destroyed and Luna was banished to the Moon, but Celestia was overcome with sorrow. She and the entire court abandoned the castle, leaving behind painful memories.\n\nThe §YElements of Harmony§! remained in the castle before Nightmare Moon's return, after which they were retrieved by the Wielders of the Elements. In a ravine near the castle is a cave with the §MTree of Harmony§!, a magical tree which controls and contains the Everfree Forest."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_153:0 "Originally Stalliongrad was known as §YPrincessyn§!, the capital of the northeastern Severyana region. It had been a relatively small town before the Industrial Revolution, when the abundant natural resources of the region allowed it to grow massively. Within centuries, it was one of the largest cities in Equestria, a thriving center of industry always covered in thick smog, especially during cold winters.\n\nYet the growth of the city had a dark side. Its workers were mistreated and discontent grew. Due to its distance from the capital, Princess Celestia remained unaware of the tension before it was too late. The workers revolted, inspired by the writings of Caramel Marks and led by §RSteel Stallion§!, and seceded from Equestria in the Winter Revolution.\n\nAfter Steel Stallion died from illness, the Supreme Soviet renamed Princessyn to §RStalliongrad§!, which remains the city's name to this day. Nowadays Stalliongrad is a proletarian city, with any remains of capitalism erased. It is the city of smokestacks, machines, smog and steel, and in the center stands the imposing Palace of the Soviets, a grand project that has been years in the making."

It is a massive urban area inhabited by millions of crystal ponies, and is a center of culture and industry. However, before 1002 ALB, it did not even exist.\n\nOver a thousand years ago, Crystal City was founded as the capital of the Empire, ruled by Princess Amore, the first ruler. Back then, the annual tradition of the Crystal Faire was established, and the magical §MCrystal Heart§! discovered. Together, these two kept the ponies' spirits high, and protected the city from §RUmbrum§! and the cold north. But then §RKing Sombra§! slew the Princess and seized power, forcefully moving much of the populace into the City to work as slaves. Equestria intervened, and before his defeat Sombra cast a curse on the Empire, making it disappear for a thousand years.\n\nAfter the end of the curse and the return of the city, the locals have had difficulty adapting to modernity. But thanks to Equestria's aid and the rulership of Princess Cadance, the city is industrialising quickly, with cars driving on the shining crystal streets.\n\nNotable sights of the city include the Crystal Castle, home of the royalty which houses the Crystal Heart, the Amethyst University with its grand library, the famed Spa, and lastly, the huge Crystal Stadium."
