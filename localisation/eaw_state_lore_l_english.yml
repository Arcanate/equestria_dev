state_lore_text_container_state_description_75:0 "The great metropolis of §MManehattan§! has been bestowed many titles in the past - Caput Mundi; the Big Apple; the City of Dreams. With its satellites, §YHayston§! and §YBronclyn§!, this megacity on the §MEast Coast§! of Equestria is unrivalled in its splendor.\n\nThe glamour of its nightlife and citizenry, and its unassailable status as a locus of high culture, all belie the true roots of its wealth - its §Ymassive industrial base§!, located on the outskirts of the suburbs. If one should gaze to the west from the crown of the Mare Statue, they would glimpse the smokestacks and cranes that juxtapose a parallel skyline - albeit dull and grimy, yet no less impressive - against the opalescence of the skyscrapers downtown.\n\nThe core of the §YEquestrian Royal Navy§! - the §MCelestial Sea Fleet§! - is stationed in Manehattan. Where massive amounts of capital flow through the wharfs and dockyards of Bronclyn, from Griffonia, Zebrica, and §Ybeyond§!, the iron fist of maritime law ensures that the waters around the metropolis are kept safe, from threats both monstrous and mundane.\n\nNow, in the new millennium, the city is threatened from without and within. Across the sea, §RGriffonia§! is poised for a decade of brutal conflict, and Manehattan's own §MThestrals§! grow more belligerent by the day, as the horrors of mechanized warfare encroach on ponies' nightmares. In the years to come, what fate will befall this city?\n "

state_lore_text_container_state_description_3:0 "§YCanterlot§!, the capital of the shining realm of §M§MEquestria§!§! and the definitive nexus of the country. Walking down the storied streets and avenues that make up the pristine city, you can spot the small tell-tale signs of the §R1002 Canterlot Invasion§!. And yet, looking at the vibrant life in the city; the cafés, the restaurants, the theaters, the parties, the soirees, you wouldn't be able to tell. Canterlot, as with the rest of Equestria, has moved on, content in their idea that the changelings were a bad event but one that will never repeat itself. Least of all anyone expects is for §RQueen Chrysalis§! to come back. But whatever the history, Canterlot is, and has been in step with the rest of the country. As Equestria grew under those first years under Luna and Celestia, so did Canterlot. When Equestria industrialized and grew past the years of medieval castles and nobles, Canterlot did too, when Luna was welcomed into the fold, it happened in Canterlot. Be it during the battle against Nightmare Moon, the battle against the Changelings, or indeed, as it has been for most of its history, the vibrant capital of Equestria, the home of ponies and Harmony, watched over by Princess Celestia's gaze, Canterlot has always been a snapshot of Equestria and its condition.\n\nBut indeed, if you took up the railroad to Canterlot, arriving at the palace, you will find the curriculum at the School for Gifted Unicorns the same as it has always been, and at galas at the Canterlot Palace they stick to routines from decades ago. While it may serve Equestria well now, they are outdated for the era, and are overdue for an overhaul. However, if a storm should hit, it would be a woeful one indeed.\n\nTime will tell what will happen to Canterlot as a new era dawns on the world. An era of opportunity, and an era of risk."

The first pony inhabitants of the area were part of the §YApple Family§!, who were granted the land as a gift by §YPrincess Celestia§! herself almost a century ago. The first apple orchards were planted, but while the trees grew, the ponies discovered magical §MZap Apples§! inside the Everfree Forest. The jam prepared from these apples became famous, attracting many migrants. Stinkin' Rich, the grandfather of the entrepreneur Filthy Rich, opened a market selling the jam, which soon grew into a burgeoining business. The Apple and Rich families still live in the town to this day, and are honoured as its founders.\n\nIn the years since, many ponies have moved to Ponyville, making it a very diverse town. All three races are present and live together in harmony. It is for this reason why Princess Celestia sent her young pupil, §YTwilight Sparkle§!, to live in the town and make some friends. She and the ponies she met soon became close friends and the wielders of the §YElements of Harmony§!, who have saved Equestria from countless threats. After her ascension into Alicornhood and her defeat of §RLord Tirek§!, Twilight Sparkle now lives in the §MCastle of Friendship§! north of the town. Next to it, she has opened the §YSchool of Friendship§! which has students from all across the world.

It also has the largest §MWeather Factory§! in Equestria, for pegasi are responsible for weather management. The clouds, rainbows and snowflakes made in the town are distributed all across the nation. Another notable feature is the §YCloudeseum§!, where the annual Best Young Flyer competition is held.

Because of this Baltimare became the center of the Equestrian labour movement, housing the headquarters of the CAN-TER anarcho-syndicalist federation of trade unions and anarchists. A large protest had been held in the city during the Winter Revolution in Stalliongrad, and the mayor of the city had been sacked by Celestia herself.\n\nDue to being located in the South-East, the city also houses a considerable minority of thestrals, whose conditions are even worse than that of the workers, but who are not allowed to join unions.

Unsurprisingly, many inhabitants of the town are part of the vast Apple family. It is governed by §YSheriff Silverstar§! who maintains law and order. The town has a saloon known as the Salt Block, a clock tower and a stage for musical performances. It is known for its horse-drawn horse-drawn carriages and local mild west dances.\n\nIn 1001 ALB, Appleloosa was at the epicenter of the short but violent conflict known as the §RApple War§!. It erupted after nearby buffalo tribes demanded the ponies to tear down their orchards, for they had been planted on their traditional stampeding grounds. The ponies refused to destroy their livelihoods and the buffalo attacked. Compromise was only reached when Chief Thunderhooves was downed by an apple pie, which he found to be delicious. Soon a historic agreement was signed: The ponies get to keep their orchards, as long as they gift apple pies to the buffalo."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_30:0 "There is a charm in the city of Ayacachtli that begets wonderous thoughts in anypony; here is a city, that was ancient before Equestria had even been formed. Located in the southern jungles, in the mountains on the border of Badlands, Ayacachtli has the dubious honour of being the oldest thestral city in the world. Legends hold it, that it was constructed by a thestral Moonspeaker with the aid of an Ursa Major. Historians, however, place its origins to many millenia ago, to the times when thestral tribes and the Neighua came into conflict and a need for a safe haven was born. Whatever it may have been, thestrals have been living in the city for so long, that only bare estimates can be given with current historical records.\n\nQuite an unusual aspect about Ayacachtli is the fact it is located inside the mountain range, inside a cast cavern dug over time by its denizens. Even as times have advanced, majority of the city is still located safely there, with just part of the more modern city located outside. Where, along with them, plenty of terraces for farming are located to feed the mountain city. But it is not food that Ayacachtli is known for; for the mountains contain many riches such as copper, silver and gold. Historians have traced many ancient trade routes leading to Ayacachtli from the north, carrying goods such as iron weapons and armour in exchange for the mined minerals. Evidence shows that Ayacachtli served as a vital link for trade between the jungles and north, through which luxury goods such as sugar and cocoa from jungle tribes passed by. Once the princesses proceeded with their formation of Equestria, Ayacachtli found itself in a favourable position - at least until the incident with Nightmare Moon occured. Now shunned, the thesrals returned to living amongs themselves, in fear of respitals and revenge for siding with the horrid monster that had once been their beloved princess. This especially hurt Ayacachtli and the city endured for centuries as but a hollow shell of a once mighty realm.\n\nToday, Ayacachtli stands as a testament for vigority of thestralkind as a near total majority of its denizens are made up of thestrals. Even the ponies there are usually tribals from the jungles, who have interacted with the thestrals far longer than any northener has and even tend to share a common tongue with. Modernization is present in the city but mixed in to tradition and the peculiar aspects of thestrals; Ayacachtli has no real streets, as near-every denizen can fly. This has led to the city developing not horitzontally as a traditional city but primarily vertically. Tall towers, reaching from the cavern's ceiling to the floor, dot the vast cave, with the odd bridge crossing the gaps between them. Even with modern electricity, most of Ayacachtli is cast in but dim light, to better suit the sensitive eyes of thestrals. Further caverns extend out from the main one, which lead to the many mining tunnels; Ayacachtli even to this day is mostly dependant upon its ore exports to many Equestrian industries north; one could perhaps find some irony in how some things never change.\n\nCentral part of the city and an aspect that cannot be missed is the Temple of Moon, located at the city's center and remains a staunchly visited complex by the thestrals. It is the place where every Moonspeaker comes to learn the traditional ways and read the ancient texts stored within there. Some said to more than millenia old but no outsiders are permitted to see them, not even a certain Princess of Books. But what a visitor can see is already extraordinary, and a sight to rival even that of Canterlot. For right past its entrance, visitors are met with a giant dome covering the main hall. On this dome there is a vividly well-detailed star map, one born from countless generations of work from the Moonspeakers. Every possible inch of the carved stone accurately details the wonders of the night sky to the point that astronomers from Princess Luna's Academy of Stars have praised the meticulous work the priests have done, even rivalling achievements historical astronomers such as Galloping Galley and Leap Ordinance. There have been calls to preserve the temple complex for sake of history but for thestrals, however, the temple still serves its original purpose, as it did since its inception; to venerate the Moon, as their forebears did before them. A work that continues on, and will do so for more millenia to come."

Clouds move on their own, gnarly and thorny plants grow without limits, and fearsome beasts stalk the shadows. Groves of Poison Joke and nests of Parasprites lure the unwary traveller to their doom.\n\nGetting lost in the Everfree Forest is the nightmare of any pony living near it.

But those days of splendour ended when Luna was consumed by jealousy and became §RNightmare Moon§! who tried to slay her beloved sister. Much of the castle was destroyed and Luna was banished to the Moon, but Celestia was overcome with sorrow.

Within centuries, it was one of the largest cities in Equestria, a thriving center of industry always covered in thick smog, especially during cold winters.\n\nYet the growth of the city had a dark side. Its workers were mistreated and discontent grew. Due to its distance from the capital, Princess Celestia remained unaware of the tension before it was too late. The workers revolted, inspired by the writings of Caramel Marks and led by §RSteel Stallion§!, and seceded from Equestria in the Winter Revolution.\n\nAfter Steel Stallion died from illness, the Supreme Soviet renamed Princessyn to §RStalliongrad§!, which remains the city's name to this day. Nowadays Stalliongrad is a proletarian city, with any remains of capitalism erased. It is the city of smokestacks, machines, smog and steel, and in the center stands the imposing Palace of the Soviets, a grand project that has been years in the making."

Its founder, §MStarlight Glimmer§!, built the first houses of the town with her fellow cultists. She had gathered a small but loyal following with her fiery speeches, but had been hunted by Equestrian authorities and fled north, past Stalliongrad. There, she had received a small amount of land in a dry valley from the §RSupreme Soviet§!, for they tolerated her radical ideology, §REqualism§!, and were sympathetic to her struggle.\n\nUsing her magical powers, Starlight Glimmer forcibly removed the cutie marks of her followers, erasing their talents and making them perfectly equal. No one was superior in Our Town, and everyone behaved almost identically. Yet in secret, Starlight kept her cutie mark and acted as the town's firm leader.\n\nThe equalist experiment came to an end when the §YWielders of the Elements§! discovered the town and unveiled Starlight's secrets. They discovered the magically-extracted cutie marks being stored in a vault. When the inhabitants had realized Starlight was a fraud and see how much happier ponies with cutie marks are, they lost faith in equalism and drove Starlight out of town.\n\nNowadays the town is a peaceful and pleasant place, with every pony being proud of their talents. The Sunset Festival is held every year, and a tree grows where Starlight's house once stood."

And most magnificent of all, the §YDuchess's Estate§! watches from the banks of the §YBrantbeak River§!, it's hedge maze open to all comers who might seek the delectable strawberry bushes hidden inside. \n\nYes, §MStrawberry§! is a land of wine, but in §MReadewetter§! the traveler learns that it is so much more."

It is said that §YKiri§!, the first pup of Geri and first King of the Longtails, was led into the valley below the mountain by a falling star that came to settle in lake §YKhezeld-Zarim§!. As he looked into the lake, he saw the stars high above and so tempted by their glimmer he dove into the water and emerged with a crown of seven diamonds that shone with the light of seven stars. A large stone carved with golden runes stands at the alleged location of this event below the grand doors of Diamond Mountain.\n\nThe doors of Diamond Mountain stand tall in a grand fortified façade carved from the mountain, guarded by many statues of ancient hounds. Behind them many-pillared halls of stone, with high golden roofs and silver floors stretch for countless miles deep under the ground, lit by lamps of crystal that shine like stars and the sun. The vastness of this space is dwarfed only by the almighty mines that stretch out in unfathomable crevasse deep under the ground lined with bridges, ramps and mining tools. From these mines’ gold, and gemstones are gathered in vast quantities and carved and chiselled by ancient paws into treasures unlike any have seen. And these treasures sit in a vast hall under onyx and gold platforms in which a mighty carven throne stands, etched with crystals and runes of power, from which the King of the Diamond Dogs rules. Forges of fire, hot enough to melt the stone itself, roar deep under the mountains in which weapons, armour and trinkets of all kinds are created by master-smiths working tirelessly day and night.\n\nDespite the grandeur, all this was §Rbuilt on the backbreaking work of slaves§!. And the treasure hall lies mostly empty after the city was sacked by forces of Hellquill. All around broken slaves, shackled and collared, work almost unseen by the free hounds to keep the city in its unimaginably grand condition."
