### FOCUS LOCALISATION ####################
###########################################
BAL_revolution:0 "Form The Baltimare Congress"
BAL_revolution_desc:0 "If we wish to prevail in this conflict, we must stand united in purpose. To this end, we must establish a democratic government to replace the old one. Proper elections will have to wait for peace, so for now every party and union will get equal representation."
BAL_anarchists_in_government:0 "Anarchists In The Government"
BAL_anarchists_in_government_desc:0 "Though the anarchists of CAN have so far been hesitant about joining the congress, they have now mostly come to an agreement that cooperation with a statist entity is necessary. With representation in the Congress, they can oppose any proposals from PON or IU that infringe too much on their liberty."
BAL_advisors_from_stg:0 "Advisors From Stalliongrad"
BAL_advisors_from_stg_desc:0 "Our comrades in Stalliongrad have had years of experience from both struggle against the bourgeoisie as well as running a communist country. We would be foolish to not ask for their help. Their sharpest minds and most cunning commanders will be a great boon to our war effort... That is, if they agree to send them here."
BAL_workers_self_management:0 "Workers' Self-Management"
BAL_workers_self_management_desc:0 "The means of production belong to the workers, so the workers themselves must be allowed to manage their businesses freely with minimal interference. With increased autonomy in daily labour, morale will be boosted and exploitation by bosses and managers will be eliminated competely."
BAL_nationalization:0 "Nationalization"
BAL_nationalization_desc:0 "The path to communism is not an easy one, and the recent economic chaos has proven that intervention by a central authority is necessary as a temporary measure, especially during conflict. As our government is a democratic and proletarian one, workers' control of the state-owned means of production is still possible."
BAL_mayors_fate:0 "Deciding The Mayor's Fate"
BAL_mayors_fate_desc:0 "The former mayor of Baltimare, Ash Moustache, proved to be no better than the despotic mare who set her police-hounds upon us during the general strike of 995. He openly welcomed the imperialist thestrals and happily cooperated with their short-lived tyrannical regime. Yet some among us speak of friendship and forgiveness. The Congress must convene to decide his fate."
BAL_loot_royal_armouries:0 "Loot Royal Armouries"
BAL_loot_royal_armouries_desc:0 "The small garrison of the Equestrian army in Baltimare was apprehended by the lunarists when they occupied the city, but their equipment was left alone in their armouries. What are we waiting for? Let's crack them open and empty them and take what we need. We don't want the guns to end up in the filthy hooves of monarchists or lunarists, after all."
BAL_form_industrial_committees:0 "Form Industrial Committees"
BAL_form_industrial_committees_desc:0 "So far there has been a complete lack of planning and cooperation in our newly established socialist economy. We must rectify this by establishing democratic workers' committees in our production facilities and farms, which will then make decentralized economic plans together and execute them in collaboration with each other."
BAL_meadowbrooks_aid:0 "Mage Meadowbrook's Aid"
BAL_meadowbrooks_aid_desc:0 "In the Hayseed Swamps, one of the ancient Pillars of Equestria lives. She is known as Meadowbrook and her skills at healing are already famous in the region. While she has shown no interest in our revolutionary cause and might harbour monarchist sympathies, she is more than willing to heal our wounded and sick militiaponies, which helps their morale as well."
BAL_weapons_from_stalliongrad:0 "Weapons From Stalliongrad"
BAL_weapons_from_stalliongrad_desc:0 "Our comrades in the cold north have a thriving industry and vast stockpiles of armaments. Surely they will happily supply us with anything we ask for? This way we will leave the Equestrian armouries alone and avoid angering them or their supporters. Of course, we must first decide what exactly we want from Stalliongrad."
BAL_supreme_economic_council:0 "Establish The Supreme Economic Council"
BAL_supreme_economic_council_desc:0 "The Congress has decreed that a single council shall be established that will be responsible for formulating a single state-wide economic plan for the duration of the war. They will also supervise that all institutions below them will closely follow their plans for production, distribution and allocation. Divergence from this plan will not be tolerated."
BAL_armed_unions:0 "Armed Trade Unions"
BAL_armed_unions_desc:0 "Our labour unions have already taken up arms and formed their own militias. Now Comrade Delicious proposes we enshrine their right to bear arms in law, further integrating the common workers into our military. Members of trade unions are eager to serve and defend their homes from reactionary aggression, though their skill is questionable at best."
BAL_revolutionary_discipline:0 "Revolutionary Discipline"
BAL_revolutionary_discipline_desc:0 "It is useless to simply order a soldier to fight. One must explain to them why they must fight and why it is important to keep doing so. Then they will take up arms willingly instead of being forced to do it, and won't run away at the first sight of danger."
BAL_consolidate_production:0 "Consolidate Production"
BAL_consolidate_production_desc:0 "It is becoming clear to us that small businesses are lacking in efficiency compared to larger ones. We must shut down the shops of the petit bourgeoisie and establish larger syndicates of production, capable of employing more workers and being easier to manage by our committees."
BAL_anti_monarchism:0 "Anti-Monarchist Rally"
BAL_anti_monarchism_desc:0 "Equestrian ponies have traditionally always looked up to Princess Celestia and other alicorns as some godlike beings who can do no wrong. The violent repression of the Winter Revolution proved otherwise, as has the recent civil war. Yet some still delude themselves. We must reveal the truth of these despicable monarchs to all, and hopefully turn them to our side."
BAL_create_mis:0 "Create The MIS"
BAL_create_mis_desc:0 "Lavender Berry, leader of the IU, has proposed we establish a secret service comprised of his party members. They will investigate suspected traitors to the revolution and apprehend enemy spies, as well as decrypt the communications of our foes. Lavender is eager to make use of his talents as the head of such an organisation."
BAL_military_commissars:0 "Military Commissars"
BAL_military_commissars_desc:0 "To maintain high morale within our militia and to better endoctrinate them to our revolutionary cause, we need political commissars attached to every military unit. Not only will they act as inspiring leaders, but will also manage supplies and maintain strict war-time rationing among our ranks."
BAL_protect_middle_class:0 "Protect The Middle Class"
BAL_protect_middle_class_desc:0 "The anarcho-syndicalists are eager to collectivize the property of smallholders and traders, thinking that they are enemies of the revolution. They are mistaken. It is the bourgeoisie, the imperialists and the monarchists who stand against us. We do not want to antagonize the moderates; Instead, let us befriend them and gain a powerful ally."
BAL_delicious_column:0 "Form The Delicious Column"
BAL_delicious_column_desc:0 "As Golden Delicious marches across the countryside, more and more ponies flock to his red banner, eager to participate in the revolution. More foreigners arrive from abroad too, eager to help our cause. We should welcome them openly and give them supplies so they can participate in the fighting and bring the revolution to our enemies."
BAL_abolish_bit:0 "Abolish The Bit"
BAL_abolish_bit_desc:0 "Money has no place in the socialist society we are creating as the war rages on. Distribution shall solely be based on need instead of personal wealth. We will repurpose native temples into communal warehouses and allow the people to take what they need from them. If shortages appear, rationing will take place so everyone gets their fair share."
BAL_red_terror:0 "Red Terror"
BAL_red_terror_desc:0 "The anti-monarchist rally has galvanized us. Let us now release this fury kindling in our hearts and aim it at the enemies among us, the bankers, the industrialists, the imperialists, the monarchists, the priests and the landowners. All who threaten the revolution of the proletariat, all who have oppressed us for decades and centuries, all must bleed."
BAL_state_capitalism:0 "State Capitalism"
BAL_state_capitalism_desc:0 "In these dire times, it is necessary for the state to run the economy. It is a patient step on the road to socialism, and combines capitalism with state control and ownership, thus preventing exploitation by bourgeoisie which occurs in unlimited, normal capitalism."
BAL_regular_army:0 "Establish A Regular Army"
BAL_regular_army_desc:0 "This war will not be won by bands of unorganized, undisciplined militiaponies. We must establish a proper, hierarchically organized and centrally commanded army. Only then do we stand a chance against the reactionary hordes threatening our revolution."
BAL_devolve_government:0 "Devolve Government"
BAL_devolve_government_desc:0 "While so far the Congress has been capable of making relatively wise decisions, the influence of the statists is too great and hinders our plans for a true socialist utopia. To remove these centrists, reformists and traitors to the revolution out of the picture, we must weaken the Congress and empower local, grassroots institutions."
BAL_arrest_anarchists:0 "Arrest Anarchists"
BAL_arrest_anarchists_desc:0 "Stalliongrad keeps threatening to withdraw support if we do not do something about the radical mobs endangering the integrity of our newborn communist state. We cannot allow them to roam around with their own armed patrols, illegally collectivizing what they want and disregarding the decisions of the Congress. Law and order must be restored by any means necessary."
BAL_to_the_barricades:0 "To The Barricades!"
BAL_to_the_barricades_desc:0 "Now that we are secure from within, we must secure ourselves from without. Reactionaries wishing to destroy our revolution must be crushed. The workers must be rallied to defend their communal homes from the enemy who wishes to take everything away from us and reduce us back into slavery. Long live the revolution! They shall not pass!"

BAL_proclaim_sesr:0 "Proclaim The SESR"
BAL_proclaim_sesr_desc:0 "Now that we have defeated the opposition to our revolution, it is time to integrate the lands which were previously under reactionary occupation. All proletariat are welcome to join our newborn South-Eastern Socialist Republic and embrace its socialist ideals. Workers of the south-east, unite!"
BAL_elections:0 "Hold Elections"
BAL_elections_desc:0 "The foundations for our republic are in place. Soon it will be time for the provisional government to step down and for new leaders, elected democratically, to take their place. Of course, reactionary parties will not be allowed to participate, but other than that all adult proletariat are free to vote or become candidates."
BAL_complete_anarchy:0 "CAN's Revolution"
BAL_complete_anarchy_desc:0 "The militants of the Confederation of Anarchists have succeeded in their goal of dismantling the despicable state. Now the workers of the south-east can know true freedom and communism, instead of the propagandist lies that POU and IU wish to feed them. Power begets parasites. Long live Anarchy!"
BAL_hunt_monarchists:0 "Drive Out The Monarchists"
BAL_hunt_monarchists_desc:0 "Supporters of the old order have no place in our revolutionary society. Celestia is like an overbearing authoritative mother, and these fools are like children who do not dare to speak against her. If they love her so much, then why don't they get the heck out of here and run back to their sweet princess?"
BAL_erase_statism:0 "Erase All Traces Of Statism"
BAL_erase_statism_desc:0 "The bloated, inefficient and heartless organism of state must not simply be slain, its remains must be burnt to ashes. All the bureaucrats will have to find new employment, but at least we are no longer oppressed by an artificial monster we had created to rule over us. The end result will be a patchwork of decentralized, autonomous communes which govern themselves."
BAL_freedom_of_faith:0 "Freedom Of Faith"
BAL_freedom_of_faith_desc:0 "While many of us have low opinions on religion, it is ultimately each individual's private matter. As long as faith is not used as a tool of oppression, it will be allowed to be practiced freely. The natives will rejoice and be reassured that we have no intention to repress their unique and valuable culture."
BAL_crush_lunatics:0 "Hunt Down The Lunatics"
BAL_crush_lunatics_desc:0 "Lunarists, or as we call them, lunatics, are a threat to our revolution. They remain loyal to their tyrannical despot, Nightmare Moon, and her clique of military oppressors. It seems it was not enough to defeat them once, we have to do so again. Let the hunt begin."
BAL_native_communes:0 "Native Communes"
BAL_native_communes_desc:0 "The natives wish for little more than to be left alone. This can easily be arranged. The tribes barely have any concept of property and private ownership anyways, so all we need to do is gently encourage collectivization while respecting their traditions."
BAL_no_princesses_state_or_boss:0 "No Princesses, Nor State, Nor Boss"
BAL_no_princesses_state_or_boss_desc:0 "Despots and overlords, oppressors of all kind, do not exist in our free society. Voluntary cooperation, mutual aid and horizontalism form our core principles. No one is forced to do anything, yet everyone must understand the importance of the greater good. We have no need for anyone to guide or lead us, as long as we share a common goal. Freedom forever!"
BAL_our_syndie_buddies:0 "Our Syndicalist Friends"
BAL_our_syndie_buddies_desc:0 "The labour unions of TER have always been our close allies and aided us in our struggle for liberty. We should now repay them and make amends, integrating the unions into our confederacy. Working together, we will reach greater heights than we ever could by ourselves."
BAL_participatory_democracy:0 "Participatory Democracy"
BAL_participatory_democracy_desc:0 "The representative democracy of SESR was a joke. True democracy isn't about choosing who makes decisions for you. It is about being able to participate in decision-making personally. Every individual has the right to take part in the politics of their commune, and each commune can take part in the politics of the confederacy. Thus, we will have real, direct democracy."
BAL_tear_down_taboos:0 "Tear Down Taboos"
BAL_tear_down_taboos_desc:0 "The rules of our free society are not as restrictive and oppressive as the laws of the past. Almost everything that doesn't harm others is allowed, as individuals cannot impose their own morality upon others. Things which were previously forbidden and frowned upon are now seen as natural. Let us liberate ourselves from the shackles of society!"
BAL_abolish_compulsory_ed:0 "Abolish Compulsory Education"
BAL_abolish_compulsory_ed_desc:0 "Forcing young foals to sit on a school bench eight hours a day and five days a week is nothing but capitalist oppression, an assembly line of skilled workers for their factories. This authoritarian education system must be torn down and replaced with democratic, voluntary education. Explaining the importance of studying to foals and including play and choice will make them eager to learn."
BAL_suffer_no_state:0 "Suffer No State To Live"
BAL_suffer_no_state_desc:0 "A new state has been founded west of us, and like us they are a confederacy. But instead of consisting of anarchist communes, they consist of racist states, bent on protecting their "rights", such as the right to oppress native buffalo. We will not tolerate such a disgusting entity existing next door. No, we must tear it down and burn it to the ground!"
BAL_syndie_gang:0 "TER Triumphant"
BAL_syndie_gang_desc:0 "The syndicalists of TER have won the elections and Golden Delicious is SESR's new chairpony. They will now seek to implement reforms to turn the nation into a federation of democratic trade unions, though some doubt if the urbanites of TER can win over the rural ponies as well."
BAL_suppress_middle_class:0 "Suppress The Middle Class"
BAL_suppress_middle_class_desc:0 "So far the traders and merchants have been unenthusiastic about our revolution and refuse to allow their businesses to be collectivized. They wish to keep their high wages and expensive bourgeois lifestyle at the expense of their workers. This cannot be tolerated, though we cannot use force. They must be driven out of the market so they eventually go bankrupt and join our collectives voluntarily."
BAL_federal_charter:0 "Federal Charter"
BAL_federal_charter_desc:0 "With a majority in the People's Parliament, we can draft a new amendment to the constitution for SESR, establishing it as a federal nation consisting of member states with extensive rights. To avoid complete chaos, the central government will retain some legislative power, but most responsibility will be devolved to lower levels, to local communes, municipalities and provinces."
BAL_rural_communes:0 "Persuade The Farmers"
BAL_rural_communes_desc:0 "As an organization of urban trade unions, we have never enjoyed much popularity outside of cities. Rural collectives remain few in number and most of the land remains in the hooves of individual landowners and native tribes. The solution is sending rural revolutionaries to spread the word of the benefits of joining a collective and highlighting the flaws of the capitalist system."
BAL_corn_lord_triumphs:0 "POU Victorious"
BAL_corn_lord_triumphs_desc:0 "The communist POU party, lead by Cricket Chafer, has won the elections. [STG.GetLeader] of Stalliongrad has already sent congratulations and is willing to support our young nation on its path to true socialism. Their help might be needed, as SESR still has many problems to resolve."
BAL_oh_shit_oh_fuck:0 "IU In Power"
BAL_oh_shit_oh_fuck_desc:0 "The plans were successful. Traitors to the revolution have been sidelined. Our control of the SESR has been mostly secured. Yet dissidents and reactionary filth remain. They must be eradicated with extreme prejudice. This is Comrade Berry's decree and it will be obeyed.\n\nGlory to the South-East."

###########################################
BAL_economic_chaos:0 "Economic Chaos"
BAL_economic_chaos_desc:0 "Following the beginning of the civil war, occupation by lunarists and the recent revolution, the economy of Baltimare is in tatters. Trade links which kept the city's industry alive have been severed and the country is surrounded on all sides by hostiles. Things are not made better by the fact that socialists and anarchists have forcefully nationalized or collectivized farms and factories without establishing proper management for them."
BAL_economic_chaos2:0 "Economic Chaos"
BAL_economic_chaos2_desc:0 "Thanks to hasty economic reforms, some semblance of order has been introduced to the economy and production rates have increased. But many issues remain which hurt the efficiency of most facilities."
BAL_economic_chaos3:0 "Economic Chaos"
BAL_economic_chaos3_desc:0 "Further reforms and policy changes have completely restructured the economy, which has helped with both production and distribution. Foreign aid has been received as well and put to use. However, more work remains to be done before Baltimare's economy has fully recovered."
BAL_military_disarray:0 "Military Disarray"
BAL_military_disarray_desc:0 "The "army" of Baltimare, if you can call it that, consists entirely of worker militias who have no formal military training and a small amount of experience they got from driving out the lunarist occupiers. Their equipment and officers are both lacking and, worst of all, there is no unified command structure, with most units acting independently with no coordination."
BAL_military_disarray2:0 "Military Disarray"
BAL_military_disarray2_desc:0 "Several reforms have been implemented, which introduce some much needed order into the army. There are more officers, better equipment and more coordination among the ranks, and a rough command structure is being established."
BAL_military_disarray3:0 "Military Disarray"
BAL_military_disarray3_desc:0 "The army is in a much better shape, which capable officers spread evenly among the ranks in a well-planned command structure.

BAL_self_managed_factories:0 "Workers' Self-Management"
BAL_self_managed_factories_desc:0 "Factories and farms are being collectivized, with the former capitalists and managers being removed out of the picture.

BAL_nationalization_idea:0 "Nationalization"
BAL_nationalization_idea_desc:0 "The Congress has passed legislation which makes it the de jure owner of all property and means of production, making it legal to seize them from their unlawful owners who are often greedy capitalists.

BAL_bit_abolished:0 "Bit Abolished"
BAL_bit_abolished_desc:0 "Some would call you crazy if you decided to simply take all the money and burn it. However, that is exactly what socialists of Baltimare have done."
BAL_state_capitalism_idea:0 "State Capitalism"

BAL_statism_erased:0 "Statism Erased"

BAL_native_communes_idea:0 "Native Communes"
BAL_native_communes_idea_desc:0 "The natives of the south-east have been allowed to retain their autonomy and traditions, as long as they participate in the confederal congress and aid in the defence of the Free South-East."

He has lived in Baltimare his entire life, working in its docks as a hauler. Poor working conditions inspired him to join a labour union and he soon became active in politics, advocating for better rights for Equestria's working class. In recent years he has been part of Stalliongrad's secret military training program and has proven his skills as a capable, inspiring leader."

BAL_waifu_desc:0 "Stylus was born in 975 ABL in Cloudsdale, her mother worked in the weather team and her father in the weather factory. Her communist ideas were often influenced by her parent's trade union activism which often alienated them from their relatives. At a young age, she would often read communist literature by Caramel Marks, and would often be intrigued by the concept of society that was described in them. She would found herself writing down notes and making stories of the based on the communist society.\n\nSadly both of her parents would not live to see to her adulthood. Her mother passed due to an accident and her father was sickened with illness. At the age of 17 without immediate employment or relatives that would take her in, she would turn to join the Equestrian Army where she enlisted the officer corps.

The most combat she would experience was in the brief Winter Revolution.\n\nAfter her discharge from the army, she would find in employment in the communist press. She would find herself increasingly disillusioned with Equestrian society, which she saw was becoming corrupted with nobility and the merciless capitalist. Stylus would often find herself taking part and organise strikes and marches that would sometimes clash with the local authorities. Slowly over time she has become one of the more notorious communists in Equestria.\n\nWhen the Equestrian Civil War broke out, Stylus found herself travelling immediately to Baltimare with a group of communists to help with the take over in the region. Upon arrival, she offers her help as a trained army officer, that will help organise the takeover and the immediate.

baltimare.1.t:0 "The Spark of Revolution"
baltimare.1.d:0 "As the Baltimare Radio broadcasted sounds of chaos in Canterlot, the thestrals living in the outskirts of the city began rioting. When a battalion of armed bat ponies appeared from the jungle, carrying a black banner of the moon, the rioters and Mayor Ash Moustache welcomed them. He was a good friend of the mayor of Manehattan and was sympathetic to the plight of the thestrals./n/nThe lunarists soon realized they were in a city that was openly hostile to them./n/nBaltimare had been a center of the labour union movement for decades and was the headquarters of the nation-wide workers’ organization CAN-TER. The unions of factory workers, dockworkers and sailors of the city had always pushed for better pay and fairer working conditions, which the mayor had been reluctant to grant in fear of losing profits. When the ponies of Stalliongrad rose up in arms, a general strike took place in Baltimare as a sign of support. The mayor responded by sending in the police to violently suppress it. Though Princess Celestia removed her from office afterwards and Mayor Ash Moustache replaced her after elections, the damage had been done: many workers could no longer trust the government and were pushed to radicalism. Stalliongrad was happy to support them as secret stashes of weapons were gathered in preparation for revolution./n/nNow that distrusted bat ponies tried to take over the city and impose strict war-time curfews and poor working conditions on the workers, they realized the time for revolution had come. Militias were formed and stockpiled weapons were put to use. The thestrals were driven out and the Mayor imprisoned, his government dissolved. The militia drove onwards, liberating the forests around Baltimare, before they had to stop./n/nThe military was now in complete disarray and so was the economy. Different unions and parties had their own militias that did not cooperate and had a complete lack of discipline, some workers collectivized factories and farms while others nationalized them. Capitalism was crushed as soon as possible, with no regard to what chaos it would cause. Now that the lunarists were gathering their forces on the frontline, it was clear something had to be done to prevent the revolution from collapsing into itself."
baltimare.1.a:0 "We must stand united against reactionaries!"
baltimare.2.t:0 "The First Session of the Congress"
baltimare.2.d:0 "The old city hall, once the home of Mayor Ash Moustache, was now filled to the brim with representatives of the numerous revolutionary factions within Baltimare. Together they formed the Popular Front, a political coalition and the only legal party within Baltimare, at least for now. The Congress was meant to be a temporary war-time government and thus monarchists and republicans were not allowed to be in it as they were suspected of being supporters of the Celestial State or Ash Moustache.\n\nOut of the myriad parties and organizations in the Popular Front, the most notable ones were the anarcho-syndicalist CAN-TER, communist PON and stallionist IU. CAN was an organization of anarchist militants closely affiliated with TER, but have so far been very reluctant about participating in the statist Congress. TER was a country-wide confederation of labour unions whose headquarters were in Baltimare. PON was a communist party supported by Stalliongrad and lead by Cricket Chafer, a veteran of the Winter Revolution, while IU was a fringe party of stallionists who believed a powerful state was needed to make true communism possible. Its leader Lavender Berry was a shady figure and a former policepony, who had defected, betrayed his fellow officers and revealed his secret membership in IU.\n\nDuring the first session, Golden Delicious of TER, who lead the offensive which drove the reactionary thestrals out of Baltimare, has been elected to be the provisional chairpony of the Congress. In addition a draft of a new constitution for the Republic was made and several social reforms were passed."

Some were so enthusiastic of this that they were eager to travel abroad and aid their equine comrades in their struggle. Among them is the writer Jorge Orellana, former teacher known for his left-leaning novels.

Some even said Baltimare Republic could benefit from his aid, for he is a well-behaved gentlecolt with diplomatic talent.\n\nAnother, seemingly the most popular proposal was punishing the mayor by humiliating and banishing him. This would not only discredit the old regime, but also remove a potential collaborator from the country. Those who opposed this idea, mostly anarchists and members of IU, feared that he would simply flee to the Celestial supporters and form a government in exile, and instead supported a most severe punishment: Death by firing squad."

Apparently he had been punished for collaborating with lunarists with public humiliation.\n\nHe is now on his way to Stableside, and has assured us he has been disillusioned with the supporters of Nightmare Moon after their occupation turned out to be more ruthless than he had expected. He was more than happy to come to our aid, as long as we provide him with new clothes.

Cricket Chafer on the other hoof said that they had enough rifles and such for now, and should request more expensive artillery guns, which we have a dire lack of. With them, we can level the jungles and blast the bats from afar. Lavender Berry then made a more unusual proposal, saying we should ask for fighter planes.

Grafitti art of an obese Celestia gorging on cake soon decorated walls and Luna was referred to as "Lunatic". Some known supporters of the princesses were dragged out of their homes, then humiliated, mocked and beaten for their childish delusions. The largest statue, depicting Celestia and standing in the central square of the city, was blindfolded by a pegasus, then theatrically "executed" by a firing squad, and finally detonated with dynamite.\n\nAnarchists and communists, syndicalists and socialists, all participated in the event, for once united as one."

Lavender Berry became the head of the newly established Baltimare Police which immediately went to work disarming anarchists and syndicalists away from the frontline. Understandably, many of them feared that this was but the first step, and that the next step would be dismantling all communes and industrial committees as well as nationalizing remaining collectives, so the resistance to the disarmament was fierce. Fighting broke out in Baltimare itself as anarchists refused to give up their weapons. Golden Delicious demanded the immediate removal of Lavender Berry from office, while Cricket Chafer tried to broker a ceasefire between the two sides, fearing it would escalate, spread and tear their young nation in half.\n\nAfter seveal days of chaos, all parties in the Congress appealed to the fighters to stand down and the fighting dissipated.

They were now responsible for their own legislation, healthcare, law enforcement, military, education and so on. In fact, the Congress was left with so little power that most communists no longer saw any reason to stay in it and resigned. Several protests to this change arrived from Stalliongrad, which feared that the revolution was now critically endangered.

New democratic workers' councils and committees are already being established across the peninsula.\n\nHowever, the largely untamed countryside remains a different matter. Native tribes, ignorant of socialism, view it as a foreign threat that wishes to eradicate their way of life. Thestrals, distrusted by Baltimareans and persecuted in many cities, are preparing to wage guerilla warfare in the jungles. Many Equestrian settlers who live on farms especially near Stableside look forward to land reform, but those who own the most land are afraid it will all be taken away from them.\n\nIt is clear more work has to be done for the entire populace to be turned to our side, but this is only the beginning."

Many of the militants belonged to SESR's revolutionary army, and thus there was little opposition strong enough to stop them.\n\nWhen the anarchists realized that no one would stop them, their actions escalated. They spread out from city to city, overthrowing any nascent governmental institutions that had been established in recent weeks, and made their way towards Baltimare. There, a small battle was fought before Golden Delicious intervened and ordered his loyal militiaponies to stand down and end the bloodshed. He convinced Cricket Chafer to flee the country and entered negotiations with the anarchists.\n\nSeveral days later, the SESR turned out to be stillborn as it was formally dismantled. The People's Parliament was no more, and any remaining military units had to either join the anarchist militias or give up their weapons.

His death resulted in a plummet of support for TER, so the other popular candidate, Cricket Chafer, was confident in his victory. Indeed when the election results finally came in, he won by a landslide and his party, PON, took control of the Parliament.\n\nBut on the following day something strange happened. Cricket announced in public that he would step down, and that a coalition would be formed between PON and IU. He said that there had been an attempt on his life and was now so afraid that he would abandon politics and retire back to his maize farm near Saltlickingham. The police chief Lavender Berry would assume temporary control over the government.\n\nWhat followed was a widespread purge of the parliament. Almost all members of PON party and other, smaller parties were arrested, suspected of participating in the murder of Golden Delicious, leaving stallionist IU the sole party in control.

Of course, there were plenty of complaints that all the ponies running for office were socialists, communists or trade union members, but they still represented diverse values and as such most eligible voters found some representative they largely agreed with.\n\nWhile the candidates for both the People's Parliament and the position of chairpony were numerous, in the end it became clear that two parties and two ponies dominated the vote: Golden Delicious of TER and Cricket "Pig" Chafer of PON. Both had gained fame during the fighting and were liked for their more moderate, reformist policies which appealed to those who were sceptical about socialism. Golden was an anarcho-syndicalist and strived for federalism and libertarian policies, while Cricket was a more traditional communist who nevertheless favoured a slow and patient transition to communism with the wise guidance of the state.\n\nAfter the first round of voting only these two remained.

Yet they were unaware that anarchist militants themselves were competent at asymmetrical warfare, and that several Neighua warchiefs volunteered to aid them against the thestrals, their mortal enemies.\n\nWith help and guidance from the natives, bands of anarchist militants entered the jungles and a deadly game of cat and mouse began. Both sides attempted to use ambushes, traps and snipers, and the only difference between the tactics of the two sides was that the anarchists fought during the day while bats fought during the night.\n\nMuch blood was shed on both sides, but eventually Starry Glory, the defacto leader of the lunarists, died in a surprise attack. The leadership structure of the bats began to collapse as they had relied on the rigid hierarchy to lead them, but anarchists had no such issues. The lunarists found no high-ranking leaders to target, no hierarchy to collapse. There was none, after all.\n\nSoon most resistance had withered away and thousands of thestrals were taken prisoner.

What this meant exactly was left unclear as the natives already lacked private property and instead based ownership on family and clan. As such, the tribes happily agreed."
