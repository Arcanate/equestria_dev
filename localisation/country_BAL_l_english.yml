baltimare.1.t:0 "The Spark of Revolution"
baltimare.1.d:0 "As the Baltimare Radio broadcasted sounds of chaos in Canterlot, the thestrals living in the outskirts of the city began rioting. When a battalion of armed bat ponies appeared from the jungle, carrying a black banner of the moon, the rioters and Mayor Ash Moustache welcomed them. He was a good friend of the mayor of Manehattan and was sympathetic to the plight of the thestrals./n/nThe lunarists soon realized they were in a city that was openly hostile to them./n/nBaltimare had been a center of the labour union movement for decades and was the headquarters of the nation-wide workers’ organization CAN-TER. The unions of factory workers, dockworkers and sailors of the city had always pushed for better pay and fairer working conditions, which the mayor had been reluctant to grant in fear of losing profits. When the ponies of Stalliongrad rose up in arms, a general strike took place in Baltimare as a sign of support. The mayor responded by sending in the police to violently suppress it. Though Princess Celestia removed her from office afterwards and Mayor Ash Moustache replaced her after elections, the damage had been done: many workers could no longer trust the government and were pushed to radicalism. Stalliongrad was happy to support them as secret stashes of weapons were gathered in preparation for revolution./n/nNow that distrusted bat ponies tried to take over the city and impose strict war-time curfews and poor working conditions on the workers, they realized the time for revolution had come. Militias were formed and stockpiled weapons were put to use. The thestrals were driven out and the Mayor imprisoned, his government dissolved. The militia drove onwards, liberating the forests around Baltimare, before they had to stop./n/nThe military was now in complete disarray and so was the economy. Different unions and parties had their own militias that did not cooperate and had a complete lack of discipline, some workers collectivized factories and farms while others nationalized them. Capitalism was crushed as soon as possible, with no regard to what chaos it would cause. Now that the lunarists were gathering their forces on the frontline, it was clear something had to be done to prevent the revolution from collapsing into itself."

baltimare.2.t:0 "The First Session of the Congress"
baltimare.2.d:0 "The old town hall, once the home of Mayor Ash Moustache, was now filled to the brim with representatives of the numerous revolutionary factions within Baltimare. Together they formed the Popular Front, a political coalition and the only legal party within Baltimare, at least for now. The Congress was meant to be a temporary war-time government and thus monarchists and republicans were not allowed to be in it as they were suspected of being supporters of the Celestial State or Ash Moustache.\n\nOut of the myriad parties and organizations in the Popular Front, the most notable ones were the anarcho-syndicalist CAN-TER, stallionist PON and state socialist IU. CAN was an organization of anarchist militants and TER was a country-wide confederation of labour unions whose headquarters were in Baltimare. PON was a communist party supported by Stalliongrad and lead by Cricket Chafer, a veteran of the Winter Revolution, while IU was a fringe party of authoritarian socialists who believed a powerful state was needed to make true communism possible. Its leader Lavender Berry was a shady figure and a former policepony, who had defected, betrayed his fellow officers and revealed his secret membership in IU.\n\nDuring the first session, Golden Delicious of TER, who lead the offensive which drove the reactionary thestrals out of Baltimare, has been elected to be the provisional chairpony of the Congress. In addition a draft of a new constitution for the Republic was made and several social reforms were passed."
