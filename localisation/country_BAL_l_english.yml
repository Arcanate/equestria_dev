BAL_revolution:0 "Form The Baltimare Congress"
BAL_revolution_desc:0 "If we wish to prevail in this conflict, we must stand united in purpose. To this end, we must establish a democratic government to replace the old one. Proper elections will have to wait for peace, so for now every party and union will get equal representation."
BAL_anarchists_in_government:0 "Anarchists In The Government"
BAL_anarchists_in_government_desc:0 "Though the anarchists of CAN have so far been hesitant about joining the congress, they have now mostly come to an agreement that cooperation with a statist entity is necessary. With representation in the Congress, they can oppose any proposals from PON or IU that infringe too much on their liberty."
BAL_advisors_from_stg:0 "Advisors From Stalliongrad"
BAL_advisors_from_stg_desc:0 "Our comrades in Stalliongrad have had years of experience from both struggle against the bourgeoisie as well as running a communist country. We would be foolish to not ask for their help. Their sharpest minds and most cunning commanders will be a great boon to our war effort... That is, if they agree to send them here."
BAL_workers_self_management:0 "Workers' Self-Management"
BAL_workers_self_management_desc:0 "The means of production belong to the workers, so the workers themselves must be allowed to manage their businesses freely with minimal interference. With increased autonomy in daily labour, morale will be boosted and exploitation by bosses and managers will be eliminated competely."
BAL_nationalization:0 "Nationalization"
BAL_nationalization_desc:0 "The path to communism is not an easy one, and the recent economic chaos has proven that intervention by a central authority is necessary as a temporary measure, especially during conflict. As our government is a democratic and proletarian one, workers' control of the state-owned means of production is still possible."
BAL_mayors_fate:0 "Deciding The Mayor's Fate"
BAL_mayors_fate_desc:0 "The former mayor of Baltimare, Ash Moustache, proved to be no better than the despotic mare who set her police-hounds upon us during the general strike of 995. He openly welcomed the imperialist thestrals and happily cooperated with their short-lived tyrannical regime. Yet some among us speak of friendship and forgiveness. The Congress must convene to decide his fate."

BAL_economic_chaos:0 "Economic Chaos"
BAL_economic_chaos_desc:0 "Following the beginning of the civil war, occupation by lunarists and the recent revolution, the economy of Baltimare is in tatters. Trade links which kept the city's industry alive have been severed and the country is surrounded on all sides by hostiles. Things are not made better by the fact that socialists and anarchists have forcefully nationalized or collectivized farms and factories without establishing proper management for them."
BAL_economic_chaos2:0 "Economic Chaos"
BAL_economic_chaos2_desc:0 "Thanks to hasty economic reforms, some semblance of order has been introduced to the economy and production rates have increased. But many issues remain which hurt the efficiency of most facilities."
BAL_economic_chaos3:0 "Economic Chaos"
BAL_economic_chaos3_desc:0 "Further reforms and policy changes have completely restructured the economy, which has helped with both production and distribution. Foreign aid has been received as well and put to use. However, more work remains to be done before Baltimare's economy has fully recovered."
BAL_military_disarray:0 "Military Disarray"
BAL_military_disarray_desc:0 "The "army" of Baltimare, if you can call it that, consists entirely of worker militias who have no formal military training and a small amount of experience they got from driving out the lunarist occupiers. Their equipment and officers are both lacking and, worst of all, there is no unified command structure, with most units acting independently with no coordination."

BAL_military_disarray3:0 "Military Disarray"
BAL_military_disarray3_desc:0 ""
BAL_self_managed_factories:0 "Workers' Self-Management"
BAL_self_managed_factories_desc:0 "Factories and farms are being collectivized, with the former capitalists and managers being removed out of the picture. Control over production is exercised by democratic (and admittedly inefficient) assemblies of the workers themselves, and their surplus production benefits us as a whole instead of going into the deep, ravenous pockets of overseers."
BAL_nationalization_idea:0 "Nationalization"
BAL_nationalization_idea_desc:0 "The Congress has passed legislation which makes it the de jure owner of all property and means of production, making it legal to seize them from their unlawful owners who are often greedy capitalists. The state-owned businesses are then given for the workers to control via a democratic process, with some restrictions."

### Leader descs

BAL_delicious_desc_yummy:0 "Golden Delicious, commonly known as "Comrade Delicious" among the ranks of his militiaponies, is a member of the syndicalist TER organization and a military commander. He has lived in Baltimare his entire life, working in its docks as a hauler. Poor working conditions inspired him to join a labour union and he soon became active in politics, advocating for better rights for Equestria's working class. In recent years he has been part of Stalliongrad's secret military training program and has proven his skills as a capable, inspiring leader."

baltimare.1.t:0 "The Spark of Revolution"
baltimare.1.d:0 "As the Baltimare Radio broadcasted sounds of chaos in Canterlot, the thestrals living in the outskirts of the city began rioting. When a battalion of armed bat ponies appeared from the jungle, carrying a black banner of the moon, the rioters and Mayor Ash Moustache welcomed them. He was a good friend of the mayor of Manehattan and was sympathetic to the plight of the thestrals./n/nThe lunarists soon realized they were in a city that was openly hostile to them./n/nBaltimare had been a center of the labour union movement for decades and was the headquarters of the nation-wide workers’ organization CAN-TER. The unions of factory workers, dockworkers and sailors of the city had always pushed for better pay and fairer working conditions, which the mayor had been reluctant to grant in fear of losing profits. When the ponies of Stalliongrad rose up in arms, a general strike took place in Baltimare as a sign of support. The mayor responded by sending in the police to violently suppress it. Though Princess Celestia removed her from office afterwards and Mayor Ash Moustache replaced her after elections, the damage had been done: many workers could no longer trust the government and were pushed to radicalism. Stalliongrad was happy to support them as secret stashes of weapons were gathered in preparation for revolution./n/nNow that distrusted bat ponies tried to take over the city and impose strict war-time curfews and poor working conditions on the workers, they realized the time for revolution had come. Militias were formed and stockpiled weapons were put to use. The thestrals were driven out and the Mayor imprisoned, his government dissolved. The militia drove onwards, liberating the forests around Baltimare, before they had to stop./n/nThe military was now in complete disarray and so was the economy. Different unions and parties had their own militias that did not cooperate and had a complete lack of discipline, some workers collectivized factories and farms while others nationalized them. Capitalism was crushed as soon as possible, with no regard to what chaos it would cause. Now that the lunarists were gathering their forces on the frontline, it was clear something had to be done to prevent the revolution from collapsing into itself."
baltimare.1.a:0 "We must stand united against reactionaries!"
baltimare.2.t:0 "The First Session of the Congress"
baltimare.2.d:0 "The old town hall, once the home of Mayor Ash Moustache, was now filled to the brim with representatives of the numerous revolutionary factions within Baltimare. Together they formed the Popular Front, a political coalition and the only legal party within Baltimare, at least for now. The Congress was meant to be a temporary war-time government and thus monarchists and republicans were not allowed to be in it as they were suspected of being supporters of the Celestial State or Ash Moustache.\n\nOut of the myriad parties and organizations in the Popular Front, the most notable ones were the anarcho-syndicalist CAN-TER, communist PON and stallionist IU. CAN was an organization of anarchist militants closely affiliated with TER, but have so far been very reluctant about participating in the statist Congress. TER was a country-wide confederation of labour unions whose headquarters were in Baltimare. PON was a communist party supported by Stalliongrad and lead by Cricket Chafer, a veteran of the Winter Revolution, while IU was a fringe party of stallionists who believed a powerful state was needed to make true communism possible. Its leader Lavender Berry was a shady figure and a former policepony, who had defected, betrayed his fellow officers and revealed his secret membership in IU.\n\nDuring the first session, Golden Delicious of TER, who lead the offensive which drove the reactionary thestrals out of Baltimare, has been elected to be the provisional chairpony of the Congress. In addition a draft of a new constitution for the Republic was made and several social reforms were passed."
baltimare.2.a:0 "We're off to a good start."
baltimare.3.t:0 "Revolution In Baltimare"
baltimare.3.d:0 "Recently news of revolution in south-eastern part of war-embroiled Equestria arrived in Sicameon. The formation of a socialist republic in Baltimare pleased the radicals and the syndicalists, for the city was the headquarters of Equestria's largest confederation of labour unions, CAN-TER. Some were so enthusiastic of this that they were eager to travel abroad and aid their equine comrades in their struggle. Among them is the writer Jorge Orellana, former teacher known for his left-leaning novels. He said that he desired to go fight against the monarchist supporters who opposed the young republic, and was confident in his own combat abilities."
baltimare.3.a:0 "Let us hope they all return in one piece."
baltimare.4.t:0 "Support From Sicameon"
baltimare.4.d:0 "Having heard of our revolution, syndicalists and radicals from the Federated Parishes of Sicameon have now arrived across the sea to support us in our struggle for freedom against monarchist oppressors. Among them is the writer Jorge Orellana, who was eager to fight. He has received training in the Sicameonese militia and Comrade Delicious has proposed promoting him, because we have a severe lack of capable officers."
baltimare.4.a:0 "Welcome, comrades!"
baltimare.5.t:0 "A Request From Baltimare"
baltimare.5.d:0 "Cricket Chafer, the leader of the communist POU party in Baltimare, has send us a secret telegram asking for our aid. He says their revolutionary struggle could benefit greatly from us sending our finest minds to act as advisors. While there, they could also work to sideline the counter-revolutionary anarchists and syndicalists in the Baltimare Congress.\n\nHowever, he did not specify what kind of advisors to send, so it is up to the politburo to decide. Should we send political or military advisors, or should we send anyone at all? Baltimare is a dangerous war zone, after all."
baltimare.5.a:0 "We shall send Gold Muffin and Spike Spiegel."
baltimare.5.b:0 "We shall send Sofia and Nevsky."
baltimare.5.c:0 "It is too risky. Send them thoughts and prayers."
baltimare.6.t_accepted:0 "Stalliongrad Sends Advisors"
baltimare.6.t_refused:0 "Stalliongrad Refused Our Request"
baltimare.6.d_gold_spike:0 "Good news! Escorted by several ships of the Red Navy, two advisors have arrived from Stalliongrad in the harbour of Baltimare: Gold Muffin, a communist changeling who is a refugee from Chrysalis' Queendom and a popular figure among the socialists of Equestria, as well as Spike Spiegel, one of the ponies responsible for the economic planning of Stalliongrad's military production. They have expressed their eagerness to aid us in our struggle."
baltimare.6.d_sofia_nevsky:0 "Good news! Escorted by several ships of the Red Navy, two advisors have arrived from Stalliongrad in the harbour of Baltimare: Sofia, a high-ranking veteran of the Winter Revolution and an expert on mobile warfare, and Nevsky, an officer known for his skillful management of logistics. They have expressed their eagerness to aid us in our struggle."
baltimare.6.d_refused:0 "Unfortunately, a telegram from Stalliongrad has been received that states they do not wish to send their advisors to an active warzone. They did say that other avenues for cooperation remained open and would be happy to send advisors after the end of hostilities, but already this has made it harder to trust our supposed comrades up north."
baltimare.6.a:0 "Their help is appreciated."
baltimare.6.b:0 "Their help is appreciated."
baltimare.6.c:0 "Our "comrades" have left us on our own..."
baltimare.7.t:0 "The Second Session of the Congress"
baltimare.7.d:0 "The Congress has once again gathered in the town hall of Baltimare, and has this time allowed its former occupant Ash Moustache to enter. He will hear what his fate will be, once the Congress comes to an agreement.\n\nAfter an hour of heated debate, three proposals proved to be most popular: Pardoning the mayor in the name of harmony, for he could not have known that the lunarist occupiers would be so harsh and simply wished to help the discriminated thestral minority. Some even said Baltimare Republic could benefit from his aid, for he is a well-behaved gentlecolt with diplomatic talent.\n\nAnother, seemingly the most popular proposal was punishing the mayor by humiliating and banishing him. This would not only discredit the old regime, but also remove a potential collaborator from the country. Those who opposed this idea feared that he would simply flee to the Celestial supporters and form a government in exile, and instead supported a most severe punishment: Death by firing squad."
baltimare.7.a:0 "Forgive and forget."
baltimare.7.b:0 "Humiliating him sounds fun!"
baltimare.7.c:0 "Shoot the bastard!"
baltimare.8.t:0 "The Mayor of Baltimare Arrives"
baltimare.8.d:0 "The deposed mayor of Baltimare, Ash Moustache, has recently arrived in Portland on a ship. He tells us that he was banished from his home city after a trial before the illegitimate socialist Congress. When our ponies questioned why he had no clothes, was completely shaved like a sheep and was covered in rotten eggs, he blushed and was reluctant to say what happened. Apparently he had been punished for collaborating with lunarists with public humiliation.´\n\nHe is now on his way to Stableside, and has assured us he has been disillusioned with the supporters of Nightmare Moon after their occupation turned out to be more ruthless than he had expected. He was more than happy to come to our aid, as long as we provide him with new clothes. With the mayor now safely in our control, [Root.GetLeader] can ask him to form a government-in-exile for the city of Baltimare."
baltimare.8.a:0 "We'll save Baltimare soon, don't worry."
baltimare.9.t:0 "Baltimare Executes Their Mayor"
baltimare.9.d:0 "News have arrived that the radical socialist revolutionaries of the Baltimare Republic have publicly executed their deposed mayor Ash Moustache. They at least had the mercy to do it with a firing squad. The mayor had been accused of collaborating with the lunarist occupiers and was deemed guilty, but this punishment seems rather severe, especially considering Ash Moustache was known to be a compassionate gentlecolt who simply wished to aid the discriminated thestral minority in Baltimare.\n\nThe Baltimare Republic has revealed its true face as a cold-blooded killer who will not hesitate to eliminate those they see as a threat. They have clearly completely abandoned harmony and friendship, so we should not even attempt to negotiate with them."
baltimare.9.a:0 "They will pay for what they've done..."
