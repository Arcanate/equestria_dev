tradefed.1.d:0 "Needless to say, our nation is facing many issues at the moment. The most important and relevant of which is the Great Strike which is currently consuming the nation, if we don't do anything about the thousands of students and strikers in the streets we risk a full scale uprising, while the majority of our advisors and fellow merchant lords are suggesting we sic the army on strikers, but perhaps a more gentle touch is required?"

tradefed.4.d:0 "After a brief moment of stunned silence the protestors thoroughly angered by the army cutting down their comerades rushed our soldiers and fought like Griffons possessed, unfortuantely for them we had more guns than them. Thus, after a long and hard fought battle our brave soldiers prevailed, and the protesters were sent packing back home, but needless to say their families shall not be forgiving us any time soon."
