### Ideas ###
TRD_the_iron_chancellor:0 "The Iron Chancellor"
TRD_the_iron_chancellor_desc:0 "When the Republican Uprising threw the Griffonian Empire into chaos, Skyfall, the Imperial Fleet’s main naval base, threatened to get ruined in the ensuing anarchy.  Fortunately, Chancellor Guichard’s decisive action saved the city from the ruin and conflict that consumed the heart of the Empire. The griffon assumed full and absolute control over Skyfall, but his firm claw guided the city away from the brink of destruction.\n\nIn the years that followed, Guichard ruthlessly crushed any opposition to his rule, both from Republican hopefuls and Imperial loyalists, earning him the nickname of ‘Iron Chancellor’. However, his clear vision and indominable purpose managed to not only secure Skyfall's sovereignty, but turn it into an oasis of peace and prosperity in the war-torn lands of Griffonia. Although the light in his eyes still shine brightly, the iron chancellor is getting rusty, leaving many to fear for Skyfall’s future."
TRD_the_riches_of_skyfall:0 "The Biggest Little City in Griffonia"
TRD_the_riches_of_skyfall_desc:0 "Just as Griffenheim is the proud political heart of Griffonia, and Griffonstone its ancient spiritual heart, Skyfall is the bustling heart of trade on the continent. Vessels from all four corners of our planet find their way to our harbour, where merchants buy the bulk of the goods to be distributed throughout the Heartlands.\n\nMany of the more exotic artifacts and produce is sold directly in the crowded shopping streets and market squares of the city. And any being who visits our city will marvel at the sheer diversity of peoples and wares that Skyfall offers, instilling desires they didn’t know they could have. Of course, what is bought and sold in the city ultimately matters little, as long as a portion of that unfathomable wealth reaches our treasury."
TRD_social_inequality:0 "Social Inequality"
TRD_social_inequality_desc:0 "While Skyfall has, for the most part managed to avoid the issues that plague the rest of Griffonia, its unique way of governing is not without its flaws. Although embracing capitalism has made Skyfall incredibly wealthy, its prosperity has not been distributed evenly across the population of the Federation.\n\nWithout any restrictions to trade, local manufacturing and agriculture have the impossible task of competing with the entire world. Many non-trading businesses failed, leaving many griffons without a livelihood, especially outside of Skyfall itself. This social and economic inequality will continue to take its toll on the populace, until some sort of solution is found."
