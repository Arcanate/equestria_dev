tradefed.1.t:0 "Emergency Meeting"
tradefed.1.d:0 "Needless to say, our nation is facing many issues at the moment. The most important and relevant of which is the Great Strike which is currently consuming the nation, if we don't do anything about the thousands of students and strikers in the streets we risk a full scale uprising, while the majority of our advisors and fellow councilors are suggesting we sic the army on the strikers, but perhaps a more gentle touch is required?"
tradefed.1.a:0 "The Bullet is the Greatest Negotiator"
tradefed.1.b:0 "We need to talk out our differences"
tradefed.1.c:0 "PANIC!"
tradefed.2.t:0 "Army Fires Upon Strikers"
tradefed.2.d:0 "After some preperation, and swift staff shuffling the army upon the command of the Chancellor fired on the mass of protesters in Skyfall."
tradefed.2.a:0 "The Federation is silent for a moment..."
tradefed.3.t:0 "It Worked!"
tradefed.3.d:0 "After a brief moment of stunned silence the protestors began to panic, and in short order ran back to their homes with their tails tucked between their legs, the Federation such as it is has been preserved... somehow."
tradefed.3.a:0 "Crisis Averted"
tradefed.4.t:0 "It Worked?"
tradefed.4.d:0 "After a brief moment of stunned silence the protestors thoroughly angered by the army cutting down their comerades rushed our soldiers and fought like Griffons possessed, unfortuantely for them we had more guns than them. Thus, after a long and hard fought battle our brave soldiers prevailed, and the protesters were sent packing back home, but needless to say their families shall not be forgiving us any time soon."
tradefed.4.a:0 "Hopefully this is the end of it"
tradefed.5.t:0 "Strikes Escelate"
tradefed.5.d:0 "Complete and utter disaster, not only did the army not put down the protesters, but a large chunk of our soldiers actually defected! Needless to say the situation has escelated."
tradefed.5.a:0 "This was a bad idea"
tradefed.6.t:0 "The New Chancellor"
tradefed.6.d:0 "After the violence of the Great Strike, and the bloodshed that followed no one quite expected what happened next. Vice-Chancellor Ghislain Guichard long time political rival of Chancellor Genevieve and Trade Prince of Grifftonia with the assistance of his associates within the Trade Council had the Chancellor arrested for "gross neglect", shortly thereafter he himself was proclaimed the new Chancellor of the Skyfall Trade Federation."
tradefed.6.a:0 "Long live the Chancellor!"
tradefed.7.t:0 "The Revolution"
tradefed.7.d:0 "After the initial violence against the protestors failed to cow the strikers into submission, tensions were escelated to a boiling point, but not a soul in the Federation expected what happened next. The Protestors supported by various military units that switched sides during the chaos stormed the Federative Council and deposed Chancellor Genevieve after which they promptly disolved the Federation and shortly thereafter proclaimed the Skyfall People's Republic with Gaubert Girard as it's first President."
tradefed.7.a:0 "Long live the Revolution!"
tradefed.8.t:0 "Negotiations"
tradefed.8.d:0 "Despite the best wishes and suggestions of her advisor and fellow Councilmbembers the Chancellor has decided to meet Gaubert Girard and the Strike leaders. After some harsh words from both sides of the negotiating table in the end both the Chancellor and Girard were able to reach an accord."
tradefed.8.a:0 "The Chancellor agreed to all of the Strikers' demands"
tradefed.8.b:0 "The Chancellor agreed to most of the Strikers' demands"
tradefed.9.t:0 "The Revolution"
tradefed.9.d:0 "In accordance to the Strikers' demands Chancellor Genevieve has formally stepped down as the leader of the Trade Federation, and in her place Gaubert Girard took the reigns of the country, shortly afterwards the Skyfall People's Republic was proclaimed and the Federative Council disolved."
tradefed.9.a:0 "Something feels off..."
tradefed.10.t:0 "The Woodpeckers"
tradefed.10.d:0 "It happened almost too suddenly for anyone to react, but two weeks after the proclimation of the Skyfall People's Republic the Woodpeckers made their move. In the middle of the night they struck, murdering nearly every representative of the Skyfall People's Council inculding President Girard himself, after which they used their ties to the old Federation's Military to take over both Grifftonia and Skyfall before anyone could even react... by early dawn the Woodpeckers had almost singleclawedly restored the Federation, and proclaimed their Grandmaster Ghislain Guichard as Chancellor."
tradefed.10.a:0 "Long Live the Chancellor!"
tradefed.11.t:0 "Peaceful Resolution"
tradefed.11.d:0 "After tense negotiations the Chancellor has agreed to some of Girard's demands, and while some strikers decided to stay in the streets to voice their discontent the majority quietly left for their homes. However, something seems off, what should have been a great victory for Genevieve and the current Government has been met with a rather cold reception by the rest of the Federation's representatives, particularly Vice-Chancellor Guichard who seemed outright vivid."
tradefed.11.a:0 "Something seems fishy..."
tradefed.12.t:0 "Chaos in the Streets"
tradefed.12.d:0 "Due to the Government doing literally nothing the streets of Skyfall have turned into a battleground, only fate shall decide what happens next."
tradefed.12.a:0 "To the Strongest"
tradefed.13.t:0 "The Woodpeckers"
tradefed.13.d:0 "During the chaos that consumed the nation Vice-Chancellor Ghislain took over the reigns of Government and managed to stabilise the situation, shortly after he proclaimed himself the acting Chancellor of the Federation."
tradefed.13.a:0 "Long live the New Chancellor!"
tradefed.14.t:0 "The Center Holds"
tradefed.14.d:0 "After a long week of violence Chancellor Genevieve with the help of the Federal military has managed to retain control of the Federation and her Chancellorship, although she will need to institute major reforms to make sure it stays that way."
tradefed.14.a:0 "Long live the Federation!"
tradefed.15.t:0 "The Revolution"
tradefed.15.d:0 "In the end once the fires had settled down and the populace calmed the Strikers managed to coup the Government, disolve the Federation and proclaimed the Skyfall People's Republic with Gaubert Girard as it's first acting President."
tradefed.15.a:0 "Long Live the Revolution!"
tradefed.16.t:0 "A New Federation"
tradefed.16.d:0 "With the insidious forces of the Woodpeckers beaten at long last and with the governmental and societal reforms instituted by Chancellor Genevieve now fully in place we can hardly call ourselves a Trade Federation anymore, thus the time has come for Chancellor Genevieve to proclaim the foundation of the First Republic of Skyfall with herself as our President."
tradefed.16.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"
tradefed.17.t:0 "An Invitation"
tradefed.17.d:0 "The recently created Skyfall Republic has invited us to join their new country, offering us many economic benefits should we join."
tradefed.17.a:0 "We shall join"
tradefed.17.b:0 "We respectfully decline"
tradefed.18.t:0 "The Fezzerian Accept"
tradefed.18.d:0 "The Fezzerian seeing wisdom in our offer have decided to join our nation, bringing millions of new citizens into our Republic."
tradefed.18.a:0 "Great!"
tradefed.19.t:0 "The Fezzerian Decline"
tradefed.19.d:0 "The Fezzerian have decided to decline our generous offer, while we could take their decisions lying down and lose out on the valuable Fezaran trade ports perhaps we should take a more militant approach?"
tradefed.19.a:0 "To war we go!"
tradefed.19.b:0 "But... that would be unconstitutional"
tradefed.20.t:0 "An Invitation"
tradefed.20.d:0 "The recently created Skyfall Republic has invited us to join their new country, offering us many economic benefits should we join."
tradefed.20.a:0 "We shall join"
tradefed.20.b:0 "We respectfully decline"
tradefed.21.t:0 "The Graf Accepts?"
tradefed.21.d:0 "Trough what must be some form of divine intervention the Graf of Haukland has decided to join our nation, after which he promptly boarded his biplane and flew off into the sunset.,,"
tradefed.21.a:0 "Great?"
tradefed.22.t:0 "The Graf Declines"
tradefed.22.d:0 "To no one's suprise Graf Meyer has decided to not join the Republic, and while we could most certainly take this lying down, we could relatively easily take over the Hauklands should we decide to do so."
tradefed.22.a:0 "To war we go!"
tradefed.22.b:0 "But... that would be unconstitutional"
tradefed.23.t:0 "The Grandmaster"
tradefed.23.d:0 "As more and more power was eroded from the Trade Council it became more obvious to everyone living in our nation that the Federation's hours were numbered, the final blow was struck today as Chancellor Guichard had nearly all of the members of the Federal Council arrested and shot, after which he promptly declared the founding of the Skyfall State and that the ancient Woodpecker Society would lead the newly proclaimed nation with himself at the new government's head."
tradefed.23.a:0 "Long live the Grandmaster!"
tradefed.24.t:0 "The President's Speech"
tradefed.24.d:0 "My friends, we hold a unique spot in the world, we have traded with the world for centuries, we have seen Kingdoms rise and fall, Tyrants live and die, and yet here we persist a center of learning and trade, and yet what have we done? We bend over for every Despot that comes our way, and stand for nothing, but the time has come to change that. We shall build a legacy to outlast not just the Republic, but the world! We shall spread the Revolution to all the peoples of the World trough trade!"
tradefed.24.a:0 "Into the World we go!"
tradefed.25.t:0 "Bursting the Bubble"
tradefed.25.d:0 "After reviewing our national treasutry and what exactly the money was being spent on, it turned out that about 80% of our annual income was being spent on maintaing the navy or rather on paying our naval officers... needless to say this is not intuitive to the economy in any way what so ever, to make matters worse the navy itself has fallen into practical disrepair and thus maintaining it has become an even more monumental task. Even though cutting our naval funding will somewhat fix the economy the navy will continue be a significant drain on our treasury should we not take drastic action to reform it."
tradefed.25.a:0 "Scrap and sell all the ships, and buy new ones"
tradefed.25.b:0 "Repair all of the ships" 
tradefed.26.t:0 "Open for Business"
tradefed.26.d:0 "With our naval issues solved, and our trade goods secured it's time to do what we're best at."
tradefed.26.a:0 "Come on down to Skyfall!"
