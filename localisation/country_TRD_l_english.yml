### Ideas ###
TRD_the_iron_chancellor:0 "The Iron Chancellor"
TRD_the_iron_chancellor_desc:0 "When the Republican Uprising threw the Griffonian Empire into chaos, Skyfall, the Imperial Fleet’s main naval base, threatened to get ruined in the ensuing anarchy.  Fortunately, Chancellor Guichard’s decisive action saved the city from the ruin and conflict that consumed the heart of the Empire. The griffon assumed full and absolute control over Skyfall, but his firm claw guided the city away from the brink of destruction.\n\nIn the years that followed, Guichard ruthlessly crushed any opposition to his rule, both from Republican hopefuls and Imperial loyalists, earning him the nickname of ‘Iron Chancellor’. However, his clear vision and indominable purpose managed to not only secure Skyfall's sovereignty, but turn it into an oasis of peace and prosperity in the war-torn lands of Griffonia. Although the light in his eyes still shine brightly, the iron chancellor is getting rusty, leaving many to fear for Skyfall’s future."
TRD_the_riches_of_skyfall:0 "The Biggest Little City in Griffonia"
TRD_the_riches_of_skyfall_desc:0 "Just as Griffenheim is the proud political heart of Griffonia, and Griffonstone its ancient spiritual heart, Skyfall is the bustling heart of trade on the continent. Vessels from all four corners of our planet find their way to our harbour, where merchants buy the bulk of the goods to be distributed throughout the Heartlands.\n\nMany of the more exotic artifacts and produce is sold directly in the crowded shopping streets and market squares of the city. And any being who visits our city will marvel at the sheer diversity of peoples and wares that Skyfall offers, instilling desires they didn’t know they could have. Of course, what is bought and sold in the city ultimately matters little, as long as a portion of that unfathomable wealth reaches our treasury."
TRD_social_inequality:0 "Social Inequality"
TRD_social_inequality_desc:0 "While Skyfall has, for the most part managed to avoid the issues that plague the rest of Griffonia, its unique way of governing is not without its flaws. Although embracing capitalism has made Skyfall incredibly wealthy, its prosperity has not been distributed evenly across the population of the Federation.\n\nWithout any restrictions to trade, local manufacturing and agriculture have the impossible task of competing with the entire world. Many non-trading businesses failed, leaving many griffons without a livelihood, especially outside of Skyfall itself. This social and economic inequality will continue to take its toll on the populace, until some sort of solution is found."

### Focuses ###
TRD_decentralised_command:0 "Decentralised Command Structure"
TRD_decentralised_command_desc:0 "Some griffons, both in the army and out, have began to promote the idea of a less centralised army. While this would reduce our army's effectiveness overall, it would both allow more fluid tactics on the individual level as well as paving the way for new tactics."
TRD_motor_factories:0 "The Orthos Contract"
TRD_motor_factories_desc:0 "Orthos Motors, one of the most prominent companies in their market, could be made useful to the military as well. With the help of their expertise, we could design better tanks and create the factories necessary to produce them."
TRD_light_armour_experiments:0 "Pantser Experiments"
TRD_light_armour_experiments_desc:0 "While many may have seen tanks as useless in the past, tactics are changing in modern times, and with them priorities. To keep up with modern times we must evolve both our technology and tactics, and with it develop new hardware through experimentation."
TRD_heavy_plating:0 "Heavier Plating"
TRD_heavy_plating_desc:0 "While lighter models of tanks are useful against infantry, it is clear that against other armour or heavier fortification they are underwhelming. We need to design a heavier tank, with more tough and thick armour and a better build."
TRD_tank_production:0 "Mass Tank Production"
TRD_tank_production_desc:0 "Through our experimentation with tanks and our cooperation with our corporations, we have developed an extremely efficient method of producing tanks, with little wasted in time or resources."
TRD_speed_warfare:0 "Mobile Warfare"
TRD_speed_warfare_desc:0 "Tactics must change with the times, and it is clear to us that manuever is the way of the future. With more and more developments in vehicular warfare, it would be unwise for us to stick to the old tactics- we should begin shifting torwards a more modern way of thinking about war."
TRD_speed_cult:0 "The Cult of Speed"
TRD_speed_cult_desc:0 "Speed is everything in war- or so some in our military say. With our focus on manuever warfare we have also began to engrain the idea of the supremacy of speed in some, leading to them pushing the limits of our divisions and developing engenious ways to further the speed and reduce the logistical limits of our armies."
TRD_mass_combat:0 "Everyone Must Do Their Part"
TRD_mass_combat_desc:0 "While our economy is mighty, our army is not- we are a small nation surrounded by giants, with our backs to the sea. If we are to maintain our independence we need to focus on mobilising the masses in defense of their country, with propoganda promoting the common good of Skyfall."
TRD_citizen_soldiers:0 "The Citizen Soldier"
TRD_citizen_soldiers_desc:0 "We shall glorify the idea of the citizen soldier- of the common griffon who joins the fight for his country, fighting with fury for his homeland. And through this, the idea we propose shall become real in the hearts of the people, and therefore become a true reality."
TRD_expand_the_draft:0 "Autonomous Officers"
TRD_expand_the_draft_desc:0 "While the paradigm has long been that command structures should promote heirarchy, we have moved in the opposite direction. With our focus on the individual unit, whether armour or infantry, we have given more power to the individual officer than we have to the command structure which used to hold the army together. We must adapt and accept this change."
TRD_gun_factories:0 "Buyout Armouries"
TRD_gun_factories_desc:0 "There are many factories in our nation which could be of use to our burgeoning military, and yet are controlled by the private market- this can be fixed easily, with a few buyouts and a few encouragements to sell them."
TRD_doctrinal_development:0 "Doctrinal Development"
TRD_doctrinal_development_desc:0 "In the past our military doctrine has been unspectacular, a reflection of those around us rather than our own. However, with our recent developments we have began to create a doctrine which, while not unique to us, is in some ways our own, and with this we have began to explore the possibilities of our doctrine further, and should promote doing so."
TRD_spearhead:0 "The Spearhead"
TRD_spearhead_desc:0 "The concept of a spearhead, while not new, has been revolutionised by developments in armoured warfare and as such should be incorporated into our new doctrine, developing it further and making our offensive manuevers more effective."
TRD_guerilla_training:0 "Esprit De Corps"
TRD_guerilla_training_desc:0 "Comraderie, honor, duty- whatever it may be, the common spirit of our army must be promoted, so we shall have a unified and motivated fighting force prepared to fight."
TRD_support_squads:0 "Support Squads"
TRD_support_squads_desc:0 "With our focus on smaller entities within the army, the importance of support squads to help our divisions has become more important and so more resources should be put into developing new equipment and tactics for these support squads."
TRD_archibalds_knight:0 "The Freie Ritter"
TRD_archibalds_knight_desc:0 ""

TRD_fidos_ironpaws:0 "The Steelpaws"
TRD_fidos_ironpaws_desc:0 ""
TRD_centralised_command:0 "Centralised Command Structure"
TRD_centralised_command_desc:0 "To further the effectiveness of our army we first must strengthen our command structure, further centralising it and allowing for a better organised army. Though this may reduce our tactical flexibility, it is worth the cost."
TRD_massed_artillery:0 "An Endless Barrage"
TRD_massed_artillery_desc:0 "Artillery has never failed us in the past, and as such we should focus more on it. Using our strong economy, we can create mass artillery which can overwhelm the enemy- our doctrine should be a reflection of this."
TRD_overwhelming_firepower:0 "Overwhelming Firepower"
TRD_overwhelming_firepower_desc:0 "Why throw good griffons to their death when we could launch shells instead? By taking advantage of our economy to overwhelm the enemy with bombardment and bullets, we will not provide them any time to recover from our attacks- allowing us to easily defeat them."
TRD_trench_warfare_f:0 "The Classics"
TRD_trench_warfare_f_desc:0 "There's no need to fix what isn't broken- and the classical tactics of superior planning and preperation are the safest way to go, as a cunning plan can win many battles which seem lost."
TRD_a_plan_for_everything:0 "A Plan For Everything"
TRD_a_plan_for_everything_desc:0 "The great minds of our military staff will be forever at work, hatching plans for any scenario, no matter how unlikely- and through their engenuity we shall keep our nation prepared."
TRD_a_grand_army:0 "A Grand Army"
TRD_a_grand_army_desc:0 "Our army must be grand, and it must be organised- these two things are certain, and must be promoted above all else. For if the army falls into disarray, or there are no griffons to man the guns, nothing else will matter."
TRD_motorization_f:0 "Motorisation"
TRD_motorization_f_desc:0 "Warfare has always required flexibility, modern warfare more than ever. While infantry provide some of this, implementing motorised infantry either in support roles or in their own units will help to provide much-needed speed on the battlefield."
TRD_radio_implementation:0 "Radio Implementation"
TRD_radio_implementation_desc:0 "The radio is a marvelous invention, and perfect for our army. Through its use we can maintain our command over vast distances, and transfer information from one side of the country to the next. We need to take advantage of this at once, lest our enemies do so first."
TRD_complete_destruction:0 "Complete Annihilation"
TRD_complete_destruction_desc:0 "Our artillery will fill the skies, their steel rain supplied by the mighty industries of our nation. Never will the enemy be safe from our oppressive firepower, annihilating any resistance from our army's advance- or preventing any push into our homeland."
TRD_cryptography:0 "Dig In And Pray"
TRD_cryptography_desc:0 "Our infantry must always be prepared to dig entrenchments and follow orders, frontline engineers preparing fortifications as their officers plan for the next offensive."
TRD_artillery_construction:0 "The Lionwares Buyout"
TRD_artillery_construction_desc:0 "Lionwares Cannonry of Wonders, a company which produces, well, cannons- has quite a few factories. Factories with trained workers, specialised equipment, all of which would be perfect for our artillery guns- with a little persuasion and a good bit of money, we will be able to purchase this company for state use, and put it to use making our guns."
TRD_new_artillery:0 "Cannons of the Modern Age"
TRD_new_artillery_desc:0 "Our guns have become outdated, and this cannot do. We need to focus on updating our artillery in order to maintain a competetive fighting force, and not fall behind."
TRD_special_forces_initiative:0 "Taskforce 141"
TRD_special_forces_initiative_desc:0 "While our army is fine, it is lacking in divisions dedicated to specialised tasks. While we have some veteran marines, little else exists- this must change if we are to establish a further presence in the skies and sea."
TRD_rocket_artillery_f:0 "The Nebelwerfer"
TRD_rocket_artillery_f_desc:0 "The Nebelwerfer- a smoke mortar- is a hypothetical weapon idea that has been brought to us for further development. In concept used for throwing smoke shells, it also would be useful for everything from High Explosive rounds to different gas-based payloads."
TRD_mobile_artillery_batteries:0 "New Armouries"
TRD_mobile_artillery_batteries_desc:0 "Our old factories have served us well, but to take advantage of the new generation equipment we are developing we need to build new factories to produce them."
TRD_grifftonia_academy:0 "The West Beak Military Academy"
TRD_grifftonia_academy_desc:0 "As we develop our army, we need both to promote developments in our weaponry and tactics, as well as training new officers and soldiers. As such, the idea has been pitched for us to create a new military academy- one which could help train our officers and those creating new technologies for us to use."
TRD_magical_rifles:0 "The Power of Crystals"
TRD_magical_rifles_desc:0 "While magic technology has been mostly untapped in our army, there is a steady supply of crystals in the northern hills we could easily purchase for use. Magical weaponry might give us an edge over our enemies, and so the idea of developing our own magical rifles has been brought forth."

TRD_cat_base_strike_f:0 "Horst's Naval Aviation"
TRD_cat_base_strike_f_desc:0 "Horst Whitefeather is the primary force behind the idea of naval aviation within our navy.

TRD_cat_fleet_in_being_f:0 "Giraud's Grand Battle Fleet"

TRD_naval_planes_f:0 "The Naval Aviation Department"
TRD_naval_planes_f_desc:0 "In accordance with Whitefeather's plan, we need to focus not only on developing superior ships, but also on the planes to fit them. We need to create bombers which can more easily be used on carriers and in naval combat, to take full advantage of our new naval direction."
TRD_heavy_cruiser_f:0 "Heavier Cruisers"
TRD_heavy_cruiser_f_desc:0 "Cruisers, while not as strong as battleships, are still useful and should not be overlooked. By developing a new line of especially heavy cruisers, we can support our main fleet with less expensive but still effective heavy ships."
TRD_destroyer_f:0 "Patrol Boats"

TRD_light_cruiser_f:0 "New Cruisers"

TRD_carrier_experiments:0 "Finish the Guichard Plan"
TRD_carrier_experiments_desc:0 "Time has come to complete the chancellor's plan, focused on modernising Skyfall's carrier fleet to make it competetive in modern naval combat.

TRD_heavier_guns:0 "Fourty Centimeters of Destruction"

TRD_heavy_fighter_f:0 "Heavier Fighters"
TRD_heavy_fighter_f_desc:0 "While our current fighters function fine, it may be possible for us to improve them.

TRD_paratroopers_f:0 "The Krijgers"

TRD_new_airbases:0 "The Grifftonian Airstrip"
TRD_new_airbases_desc:0 "The plains of Grifftonia make for a useful and safe location for an air strip, which will allow control of most of the federation's airspace from an accessible location."
TRD_bomber_f:0 "Our Own Bombers"
TRD_bomber_f_desc:0 "We need to develop our own models of bombers, so that we will be less reliant on the advancements of the outside world for our airforce. This will also allow us greater flexibility in our developing doctrine, as we can design our own aircraft for our goals."
TRD_heavy_bombers_f:0 "Strategic Destruction"
TRD_heavy_bombers_f_desc:0 "While our current bombers are relatively flexible, they aren't as effective at disrupting enemy logistics as well as they could. If we were to sacrifice the ability to support combat and focus on destruction, we could more effectively disrupt the enemy."
TRD_buy_bombers:0 "Changeling Bomber Designs"
TRD_buy_bombers_desc:0 "The changelings are far away, but not too far away for our merchants. With a little convincing, we could convince them to give us some of their spare bombers for our own use."

TRD_radars_f_desc:0 "Radar technology is revolutionary, touching many aspects of warfare, especially aerial. If we fail to introduce the use of radar, we will be missing out on a crucial advantage."
TRD_air_docrtine_development_f:0 "Training Our Pilots"
TRD_air_docrtine_development_f_desc:0 "While we have began to develop superior models of plane, we lack skilled pilots to fly them. By beginning to train more griffons specifically to be pilots for our new aircraft, we will make sure that they are effectively used."
TRD_finest_pilots:0 "The Finest Pilots"
TRD_finest_pilots_desc:0 "By focusing even further on the training of our pilots, we can make a truly formidable airforce- our aces will be feared by all who fly in our lands, our fighters flown by only the most daring and well-trained griffons."
TRD_utter_destruction:0 "Utter Destruction"
TRD_utter_destruction_desc:0 "The ultimate purpose of the airforce is to support the army, and our doctrine must reflect that.

TRD_rocketry_f:0 "Adopt the V-2"
