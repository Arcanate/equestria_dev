TRD_the_iron_chancellor:0 "The Iron Chancellor"
TRD_the_iron_chancellor_desc:0 "When the Republican Uprising threw the Griffonian Empire into chaos, Skyfall, the Imperial Fleet’s main naval base, threatened to get ruined in the ensuing anarchy.  Fortunately, Chancellor Guichard’s decisive action saved the city from the ruin and conflict that consumed the heart of the Empire. The griffon assumed full and absolute control over Skyfall, but his firm claw guided the city away from the brink of destruction.\n\nIn the years that followed, Guichard ruthlessly crushed any opposition to his rule, both from Republican hopefuls and Imperial loyalists, earning him the nickname of ‘Iron Chancellor’. However, his clear vision and indominable purpose managed to not only secure Skyfall's sovereignty, but turn it into an oasis of peace and prosperity in the war-torn lands of Griffonia. Although the light in his eyes still shine brightly, the iron chancellor is getting rusty, leaving many to fear for Skyfall’s future."
TRD_the_riches_of_skyfall:0 "The Biggest Little City in Griffonia"
TRD_the_riches_of_skyfall_desc:0 "Just as Griffenheim is the proud political heart of Griffonia, and Griffonstone its ancient spiritual heart, Skyfall is the bustling heart of trade on the continent. Vessels from all four corners of our planet find their way to our harbour, where merchants buy the bulk of the goods to be distributed throughout the Heartlands.\n\nMany of the more exotic artifacts and produce is sold directly in the crowded shopping streets and market squares of the city. And any being who visits our city will marvel at the sheer diversity of peoples and wares that Skyfall offers, instilling desires they didn’t know they could have. Of course, what is bought and sold in the city ultimately matters little, as long as a portion of that unfathomable wealth reaches our treasury."
TRD_social_inequality:0 "Social Inequality"
TRD_social_inequality_desc:0 "While Skyfall has, for the most part managed to avoid the issues that plague the rest of Griffonia, its unique way of governing is not without its flaws. Although embracing capitalism has made Skyfall incredibly wealthy, its prosperity has not been distributed evenly across the population of the Federation.\n\nWithout any restrictions to trade, local manufacturing and agriculture have the impossible task of competing with the entire world. Many non-trading businesses failed, leaving many griffons without a livelihood, especially outside of Skyfall itself. This social and economic inequality will continue to take its toll on the populace, until some sort of solution is found."

### Focuses ###
#Normal MIlitary#
TRD_decentralised_command:0 "Decentralised Command Structure"
TRD_decentralised_command_desc:0 "Some griffons, both in the army and out, have began to promote the idea of a less centralised army. While this would reduce our army's effectiveness overall, it would both allow more fluid tactics on the individual level as well as paving the way for new tactics."
TRD_motor_factories:0 "The Orthos Contract"
TRD_motor_factories_desc:0 "Orthos Motors, one of the most prominent companies in their market, could be made useful to the military as well. With the help of their expertise, we could design better tanks and create the factories necessary to produce them."
TRD_light_armour_experiments:0 "Pantser Experiments"
TRD_light_armour_experiments_desc:0 "While many may have seen tanks as useless in the past, tactics are changing in modern times, and with them priorities. To keep up with modern times we must evolve both our technology and tactics, and with it develop new hardware through experimentation."
TRD_heavy_plating:0 "Heavier Plating"
TRD_heavy_plating_desc:0 "While lighter models of tanks are useful against infantry, it is clear that against other armour or heavier fortification they are underwhelming. We need to design a heavier tank, with more tough and thick armour and a better build."
TRD_tank_production:0 "Mass Tank Production"
TRD_tank_production_desc:0 "Through our experimentation with tanks and our cooperation with our corporations, we have developed an extremely efficient method of producing tanks, with little wasted in time or resources."
TRD_speed_warfare:0 "Mobile Warfare"
TRD_speed_warfare_desc:0 "Tactics must change with the times, and it is clear to us that manuever is the way of the future. With more and more developments in vehicular warfare, it would be unwise for us to stick to the old tactics- we should begin shifting torwards a more modern way of thinking about war."
TRD_speed_cult:0 "The Cult of Speed"
TRD_speed_cult_desc:0 "Speed is everything in war- or so some in our military say. With our focus on manuever warfare we have also began to engrain the idea of the supremacy of speed in some, leading to them pushing the limits of our divisions and developing engenious ways to further the speed and reduce the logistical limits of our armies."
TRD_mass_combat:0 "Everyone Must Do Their Part"
TRD_mass_combat_desc:0 "While our economy is mighty, our army is not- we are a small nation surrounded by giants, with our backs to the sea. If we are to maintain our independence we need to focus on mobilising the masses in defense of their country, with propoganda promoting the common good of Skyfall."
TRD_citizen_soldiers:0 "The Citizen Soldier"
TRD_citizen_soldiers_desc:0 "We shall glorify the idea of the citizen soldier- of the common griffon who joins the fight for his country, fighting with fury for his homeland. And through this, the idea we propose shall become real in the hearts of the people, and therefore become a true reality."
TRD_expand_the_draft:0 "Autonomous Officers"
TRD_expand_the_draft_desc:0 "While the paradigm has long been that command structures should promote heirarchy, we have moved in the opposite direction. With our focus on the individual unit, whether armour or infantry, we have given more power to the individual officer than we have to the command structure which used to hold the army together. We must adapt and accept this change."
TRD_gun_factories:0 "Buyout Armouries"
TRD_gun_factories_desc:0 "There are many factories in our nation which could be of use to our burgeoning military, and yet are controlled by the private market- this can be fixed easily, with a few buyouts and a few encouragements to sell them."
TRD_doctrinal_development:0 "Doctrinal Development"
TRD_doctrinal_development_desc:0 "In the past our military doctrine has been unspectacular, a reflection of those around us rather than our own. However, with our recent developments we have began to create a doctrine which, while not unique to us, is in some ways our own, and with this we have began to explore the possibilities of our doctrine further, and should promote doing so."
TRD_spearhead:0 "The Spearhead"
TRD_spearhead_desc:0 "The concept of a spearhead, while not new, has been revolutionised by developments in armoured warfare and as such should be incorporated into our new doctrine, developing it further and making our offensive manuevers more effective."
TRD_guerilla_training:0 "Esprit De Corps"
TRD_guerilla_training_desc:0 "Comraderie, honor, duty- whatever it may be, the common spirit of our army must be promoted, so we shall have a unified and motivated fighting force prepared to fight."
TRD_support_squads:0 "Support Squads"
TRD_support_squads_desc:0 "With our focus on smaller entities within the army, the importance of support squads to help our divisions has become more important and so more resources should be put into developing new equipment and tactics for these support squads."
TRD_archibalds_knight:0 "The Freie Ritter"
TRD_archibalds_knight_desc:0 ""
TRD_archlights_mages:0 "Le Carnaval Magique"

TRD_centralised_command:0 "Centralised Command Structure"
TRD_centralised_command_desc:0 "To further the effectiveness of our army we first must strengthen our command structure, further centralising it and allowing for a better organised army. Though this may reduce our tactical flexibility, it is worth the cost."
TRD_massed_artillery:0 "An Endless Barrage"
TRD_massed_artillery_desc:0 "TRD_massed_artillery_desc:0 "Artillery has never failed us in the past, and as such we should focus more on it. Using our strong economy, we can create mass artillery which can overwhelm the enemy- our doctrine should be a reflection of this.""
TRD_overwhelming_firepower:0 "Overwhelming Firepower"
TRD_overwhelming_firepower_desc:0 "Why throw good griffons to their death when we could launch shells instead? By taking advantage of our economy to overwhelm the enemy with bombardment and bullets, we will not provide them any time to recover from our attacks- allowing us to easily defeat them."
TRD_trench_warfare_f:0 "The Classics"
TRD_trench_warfare_f_desc:0 "There's no need to fix what isn't broken- and the classical tactics of superior planning and preperation are the safest way to go, as a cunning plan can win many battles which seem lost."
TRD_a_plan_for_everything:0 "A Plan For Everything"
TRD_a_plan_for_everything_desc:0 "The great minds of our military staff will be forever at work, hatching plans for any scenario, no matter how unlikely- and through their engenuity we shall keep our nation prepared."
TRD_a_grand_army:0 "A Grand Army"
TRD_a_grand_army_desc:0 "Our army must be grand, and it must be organised- these two things are certain, and must be promoted above all else. For if the army falls into disarray, or there are no griffons to man the guns, nothing else will matter."
TRD_motorization_f:0 "Motorisation"
TRD_motorization_f_desc:0 "Warfare has always required flexibility, modern warfare more than ever. While infantry provide some of this, implementing motorised infantry either in support roles or in their own units will help to provide much-needed speed on the battlefield."
TRD_radio_implementation:0 "Radio Implementation"
TRD_radio_implementation_desc:0 "The radio is a marvelous invention, and perfect for our army. Through its use we can maintain our command over vast distances, and transfer information from one side of the country to the next. We need to take advantage of this at once, lest our enemies do so first."
TRD_complete_destruction:0 "Complete Annihilation"
TRD_complete_destruction_desc:0 "Our artillery will fill the skies, their steel rain supplied by the mighty industries of our nation. Never will the enemy be safe from our oppressive firepower, annihilating any resistance from our army's advance- or preventing any push into our homeland."
TRD_cryptography:0 "Dig In And Pray"
TRD_cryptography_desc:0 "Our infantry must always be prepared to dig entrenchments and follow orders, frontline engineers preparing fortifications as their officers plan for the next offensive."
TRD_artillery_construction:0 "The Lionwares Buyout"
TRD_artillery_construction_desc:0 "Lionwares Cannonry of Wonders, a company which produces, well, cannons- has quite a few factories. Factories with trained workers, specialised equipment, all of which would be perfect for our artillery guns- with a little persuasion and a good bit of money, we will be able to purchase this company for state use, and put it to use making our guns."
TRD_new_artillery:0 "Cannons of the Modern Age"
TRD_new_artillery_desc:0 "Our guns have become outdated, and this cannot do. We need to focus on updating our artillery in order to maintain a competetive fighting force, and not fall behind."
TRD_special_forces_initiative:0 "Taskforce 141"
TRD_special_forces_initiative_desc:0 "While our army is fine, it is lacking in divisions dedicated to specialised tasks. While we have some veteran marines, little else exists- this must change if we are to establish a further presence in the skies and sea."
TRD_rocket_artillery_f:0 "The Nebelwerfer"
TRD_rocket_artillery_f_desc:0 "The Nebelwerfer- a smoke mortar- is a hypothetical weapon idea that has been brought to us for further development. In concept used for throwing smoke shells, it also would be useful for everything from High Explosive rounds to different gas-based payloads."
TRD_mobile_artillery_batteries:0 "New Armouries"
TRD_mobile_artillery_batteries_desc:0 "Our old factories have served us well, but to take advantage of the new generation equipment we are developing we need to build new factories to produce them."
TRD_grifftonia_academy:0 "The West Beak Military Academy"
TRD_grifftonia_academy_desc:0 "As we develop our army, we need both to promote developments in our weaponry and tactics, as well as training new officers and soldiers. As such, the idea has been pitched for us to create a new military academy- one which could help train our officers and those creating new technologies for us to use."
TRD_magical_rifles:0 "The Power of Crystals"
TRD_magical_rifles_desc:0 "While magic technology has been mostly untapped in our army, there is a steady supply of crystals in the northern hills we could easily purchase for use. Magical weaponry might give us an edge over our enemies, and so the idea of developing our own magical rifles has been brought forth."

TRD_enhancing_our_prosperity_desc:0 "The Chancellor has made his decision. With his ability to hold on to complete power fading, he has put his trust in the merchants which are the lifeblood of our society, in hopes of bringing further wealth and prosperity to our nation. His grip on the nation's politics remains strong however, and while he is around no transfer of power will be made, only concessions."
TRD_sell_unpforitable_businesses:0 "Liquidate Unprofitable Assets"
TRD_sell_unpforitable_businesses_desc:0 "Supporters of austerity have petitioned the government, claiming that unprofitable and useless assets are leading to economic issues for the state.

TRD_golden_griffon_cigars_desc:0 "Along with the many luxury goods we produce, cigarettes are one of our most popular exports.

tradefed.11.t:0 "The Meeting"
tradefed.11.d:0 "Once again I was forced to sit through a trade council meeting. Forced to listen to the petty demands of company representatives, all failing to look beyond themselves and their interests, all demanding I do something for them. At some point, I simply had enough- I stormed out of the meeting, determined to get some fresh air, some room to think for once. However, I was soon interrupted by my naive niece, Genevieve. She came to me with a call to help the "common folk" of Skyfall, who were ailing while the merchants profitted. My mind was reeling from the arguments of the night, and I could not take it anymore- something must be done."

tradefed.12.t:0 "Liquidating Unprofitable Businesses"
tradefed.12.d:0 "After much debate and consideration, you have caved to the demands of the bankers. You have signed off many previously state-owned assets, considerably reducing the spending of the state but also somewhat weakining its power. By doing this, however, you have managed to gain favor with the very powerful bankers, especially Ferdinand von Hochsklaue, who personally payed you thanks for the programs, assuring you that by ridding the state of these assets you have only made it more efficient, and that the nation would prosper for it."
tradefed.12.a:0 "Such is life in Skyfall."

tradefed.13.t:0 "Foreign Technicians"
tradefed.13.d:0 "With Skyfall being one of the world's grandest cities, it is not a stranger to migration. Primarily from Griffonia, though with a minority coming from the west, these migrants vary, from unskilled laborers to skilled technicians and engineers. The latter group has grown to be especially of interest to our industrialists, who have began to hire foreign technicians to improve their products. While this is much to the dismay of the domestic griffons who believe their jobs are being stolen, you have kept your position firm and not surrendered to their protests. With this action we have allowed our industry to grow to new heights in reputation, and Skyfall's goods are gaining a reputation for being extremely well-designed. This practice has been especially adopted by Heinrich Kessler, an innovative industrialist who has used this foreign talent to bring new innovations to his industrial empire."
tradefed.13.a:0 "At least they're useful."

tradefed.14.t:0 "Industrial Grants"
tradefed.14.d:0 "Following your concessions to business, you have been pounded with further demands by the greedy vultures in business. Nonetheless, you have kept a cool head, and taken time to consider their demands, however greedy. While submitting to every demand of the petty capitalists would just undermine your power, by strategically providing grants to those who support you, you will maintain your power base, while at the same time helping the city's industry- a plan that you eventually decided on, after much consideration."

At the very least, he came through on his offer."

tradefed.16.d:0 "Walter Whitefeather was not a griffon you would typically associate with, but times have changed, and with them partners in business. With the promise of his support, you have managed to pass several laws allowing the use of certain additives in cigarettes. Through this the cigarette industry has boomed, and though it may be seen as immoral, it has won you friends in important places."

You had secured power and wealth was beginning to flow into the city, even moreso than before. Suddenly, your thoughts were interrupted by a sudden bout of dizziness, your breath growing short. Attempting to steady yourself against a nearby table failed, the last thing you did before consciousness faded away..."

tradefed.19.t:0 "The 'Death' of the Chancellor"
tradefed.19.d:0 "After the Chancellor was found collapsed, he was rushed to the hospital. As the news spread to griffons throughout Skyfall, the nation's politics have come to a standstill.\n\n This was not the first time this had happened- the Chancellor has faked his death numerous times in the past, leaving many to have doubts about whether he was truely dying or not, thinking he was once again attempting to drag his enemies out of the shadows.\n\n As the city lies in stasis, awaiting the verdict, the Chancellor was busy hastily writing out a will. Though the doctors were not sure when he would die, they were sure that he did not have long to live- even the best medicine in Griffonia could not keep him alive. And so, on his deathbed, the Chancellor's iron talon loosened for the final time, and Skyfall's fate no longer was his to decide."
tradefed.19.a:0 "He said what in his will?"

tradefed.20.t:0 "He Is, In Fact, Dead"
tradefed.20.d:0 "With the Chancellor's death and his will revealed to the public, the city's political machine has whirred back to life. To some dismay from the ruling classes, the Chancellor's will has been enforced, and his great wealth has been spread among the residents of Skyfall. Due to the Chancellor's unexpected death, and firm authority over the nation's politics, a successor had not been officially declared prior to his death. However, with the only powerful griffons left in the city being the oligarchs who ruled the city's business, it was clear to most who would inherit the city."
tradefed.20.a:0 "Back to business, folks!"

tradefed.21.t:0 "An Unexpected Series of Events"
tradefed.21.d:0 "With the late Chancellor's will being enforced, and the great wealth has has accumulated being given to the people of Skyfall, we have seen a minor decrease in the inequality of our city. While there are very notable class divides, many in extreme poverty have made some degree of recovery with the Chancellor's donations, and those in better positions are better off as well."

They would hold to their promises to the people and hold a conference of any Griffon who wished to come to Skyfall to make their case on the government of the new Skyfall. Though before it even began, three candidates seemed to be in the head of the race.\n\nFirst is Growder of the Centralisten faction of the Vakbonden. A powerful orator, he has advocated the strengthening of the post of Chairgriffon and for the comprehensive planning of the economy by the state, which gives him strong support amongst the new Army and Navy. Second is De Altesburg of the RSP. An advocate of Social democracy he is the most moderate of the three candidates and has the support of whatever remains of the bourgeoisie in Skyfall along with those who might not fully support this whole "Communism" thing.\n\nLast is Rosebeak of the primary, syndicalist faction. While he is generally in the center of the debate between Growder and De Altesburg, all Griffons know he will not "compromise". He is an advocate of traditional anarcho-syndicalist ideas and wishes to put the unions in charge of the entire nation as the national government."

tradefed.55.t:0 "Week I: The Republic's Economy"
tradefed.55.d:0 "Following the chaos of the revoluion and the destruction it caused to the land, the first thing on everyone's mind is how the economy will recover. As the big three all come forward with their own plans, this one will be a slugger.\n\nFirstly, Growder comes forward with his plan to centralize and control the economy through mass-nationalization of industry and resources. This has strong support from the military who could easily benefit from the nationalization of resources.\n\nSecondly is Rosebeak. He speaks of a traditional anarcho-syndicalist economy but in a way that has never been tried, he wishes for everything to be unionized, down to the very core of society and economics. This of course earns the support of the unions and many militias thoughout the nations.\n\nLastly is De Altesburg who unlike the others has delivered no firey speeches about his economic policy, he has simply written it out and presented it to the congress. Befitting of his demenour the plan is one that is extremely moderate compared to his opponents, advocating for a market economy with limited private ownership while still maintaining many of the union values of Rosebeak's plan. This has the support of those involved in the professions of trade before the revolution and the many more moderates unions and those who's success relies on trade.\n\nHow shall Syfall's economy be run?"

tradefed.56.d:0 "After the whole mess of the economy was sorted out a group of militia leaders from all across Skyfall made a speech to the congress about the value the militias provide to the nation and how they should be maintained and strengthened.\n\nThis drew ire from the Centralisten faction who afterwords sent up their own militiagriff who made the case for a more centralised military using the story of the death of his squad due to lack of organized command in the battle for the Skyfall Mint.\n\nThough despite the factions backing certain arguements there seems to be various opinions on all sides, though the militias are generally backed by Rosebeak and De Altesburg's RSP, while Growder backs his chosen candidate as harsh words are flung between the opposing military griffs... if you could even call them that yet...\n\nHow shall Skyfall tructure its army?"

tradefed.57.t:0 "Week III: Our Role Abroad"
tradefed.57.d:0 "A new conflict has been growing within the congress, this time chiefly over Skyfall's foreign policy. For once Rosebeak and Growder seem to be on the same side, with both being set against the RSP. The conflict arose over how Skyfall should prosecute revolutions in other Griffonian states. Rosebeak and Growder are full heartingly behind the idea of expanding the revolution while De Altesburg has called for patience and caution.\n\nIn any other circumstance the great revolutionary fervour would have easily overwhelmed the calls for peace, but the revolution is still in recent memory. While the arguement for the revolution is generally stronger on the surface, many in the Army and Navy have cautioned Growder to simply fall behind the RSP on this one as they do not feel ready, and many unionshave told Rosebeak it could ruin them if war was to come to early.\n\nHow shall Growder and Rosebeak vote?"

tradefed.58.t:0 "Week IV: The Role of the Chairgriffon"
tradefed.58.d:0 "In the final week over the congress the greatest debate has emerged, the debate over the power of the griffon to be elected by this congress. How much power should he hold over the state? Now of course with the autocracy of the Iron Chancellor in recent memory, no griffon will ever have total control, but the arguements keep flaring.\n\nGrowder argues that the Chairgriffon needs expansive powers in order to protect the state from the evils of capitalism and monarhcy. He says that the Chairgriff's sacred responsability to defend the people must have no obsticles in his way.\n\nOn the oppisite end Rosebeak denounces Growder as a tyrant and a demagogue and has argued that the powers of the chairgriff should be limited and that power should be held by a legislature of union representatives. And that the chairgriff should only act as a figurehead to guide the people.\n\nAt the end of the congress, wanting to avoid hostilities after its conclusion, De Altesburg proposed his own plan. One that would give the Chairgriff the same powers as any other member of the assembly of unions proposed by Rosebeak, while also granting the post the powers as the head of the military, a major point made by Growder's army and Navy backers.\n\nWho convinces the most griffs?"

Stepping onto the podium outside one of the counters adjusted his glasses and began to read from the notecard in front of him:\n\n"Citizens of Skyfall,  it has been our honor and duty to tally the votes of your representatives and declare who shall serve you as your first Chairgriffon. And so without further delay, the first Chairgriffon of Skyfall" He pauses for just half a second and takes a breath, not long enough fr anyone to notice, but just long enough to put suspence into the air. "is Adalbert Growder. Congradulations to all the candida..."\n\nNot one heard to rest of his speech. In the center of the plaza Growder's supporters began to chant their signiture sloga "Louder for Growder!". It drove some insane but it was a strong rallying cry for a griffon with that same personality, a roaring crowd hyped up on revolutionary fervor. From the stage the counter could see Rosebeak walking away from the plaza, not so much dissapointed in his loss, but dissapointed in Skyfall. De Altesburg had walked over to congradulate Growder, always the gentleman he was. But Growder? His reaction was an anomoly. He was crying. This firey and abrasive man was now crying tears of joy in the center of Skyfall. And the counter had hope for the future."

And that the need for a salary was gone with the old style of bureaucratic government. Coincidentally those "union benefits" come in the form of a new government issued bond called a "union" that citizens can use to exchange with other unions for their goods.

When prompted for any identification no creature emerged from the hull. And by the time it had been surrounded with militia brigades, no one knew what would happen next.\n\nThough, what did occur surprised everybody there. Emerging from the hull, was a frail old figure, but one of a changeling, a new sight to many in the city. By a stroke of luck, one of the colonels there that day spoke extremely fluid Herzlander, and had done personal research into the similarities between it and the Changeling mother tongue and so was able to translate. And wow. Did he have a story to tell...\n\nHe had begun his journey fighting a guerilla war against Queen Chrysalis' forces before retreating into the northern mountains and being hunted by Jaeger troops, he marched long and hard through Yakyakistan and parts of the Griffon frontier with his group of faithful followers, all to reach his end destination. Great Stalliongrad.\n\nBut he was sorely dissapointed...  As when he did reach that city, he was horrified. He found a political system ripe with corruption and infighting with self-serving politicians who had forgotten the true idea of the revolution. But he decided that he had gone long enough, why not go a bit farther? He and his followers found an old, rusty, dilapidated oil tanker on the shores of St. Petershoof, and managed to set it a sail.
