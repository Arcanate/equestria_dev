MGY_20th_anniversary_of_the_birthday_revolt:0 "20th Anniversary of the Birthday Revolt"
MGY_20th_anniversary_of_the_birthday_revolt_desc:0 "In 987, a group of students rose up on the Grand Prince's birthday to demand political freedom and liberation from foreign domination. Their protest sparked a revolution, which ended in Maregypt securing its independence for the first time in centuries. On the anniversary of this momentous occasion, we honour those brave students and pledge to safeguard the principles they stood up to defend."
MGY_the_campaign_trail:0 "The Campaign Trail"
MGY_the_campaign_trail_desc:0 "We are just beginning to recover from the Storm King's pillaging, but next year's elections to the House of Commons are rapidly approaching. If we are to expand on our slim majority, we need to shore up support at the end of our term. There are a number of pressing issues which demand our attention, although there isn't enough time for us to address them all."
MGY_those_damn_cats:0 "Abyssinian Tensions"
MGY_those_damn_cats_desc:0 "The common ponies of Maregypt are enraged by the continuing Abyssinian occupation of western Manedalusia, and desperately wish to reclaim this land from the vile cats. The Knights of Maregypt would prefer a peaceful resolution to the crisis, but the return of Somnambula has caused the hopes of the populace to be reborn, and now more and more ponies call for war every day."
MGY_stick_to_diplomacy:0 "Stick to Diplomacy"
MGY_stick_to_diplomacy_desc:0 "Although it may be a politically costly position to take, we have a responsibility to avert further bloodshed if at all possible. We must make it abundantly clear that we stand by our commitment to peace and are willing to come to the negotiating table with the cats. The fact is that armed conflict with Abyssinia is not in the interests of any of the parties involved."
MGY_remind_of_defeat:0 "Memories of Defeat"
MGY_remind_of_defeat_desc:0 "Less than a decade ago, the Storm King's horde smashed through our defences and brutally ransacked the country. The humiliation exposed the Maregyptian army's fundamental flaws, and these weaknesses have yet to be fully reckoned with. In light of this, military victory over Abyssinia is far from certain. Recklessly starting a war now would be pure folly."
MGY_stage_debate:0 "Stage a Debate"
MGY_stage_debate_desc:0 "We have taken our position on the question of Manedalusia, but there remain many ponies who disagree or who remain undecided. Fortunately, there is no shortage of orators sympathetic to our view who would surely win over the public if given the chance. Organising a high-profile debate on this issue will greatly help ponies in making up their minds."
MGY_indulge_jingoism:0 "Indulge in Jingoism"
MGY_indulge_jingoism_desc:0 "The opinion of the public is clear: they despise the unjust settlement imposed upon us by the Great Powers and are spoiling for a fight with Abyssinia. Denying them would only serve to destabilise the country even further. And so we must let the ponies know that we share their passion and outrage, and that we will do whatever it takes to expel the Abyssinians tyrants from Manedalusia!"
MGY_manedalusia_is_maregypt:0 "Manedalusia is Maregypt!"
MGY_manedalusia_is_maregypt_desc:0 "Manedalusia has been a part of Maregypt for centuries, and was seized only recently by the treacherous Abyssinians. We hold that feline domination over any portion of Manedalusia is an intolerable affront to justice. If the Abyssinians refuse to concede and withdrawal from the territory, then we have no choice but to remedy this injustice by force."
MGY_win_without_war:0 "Win Without War"
MGY_win_without_war_desc:0 "Throughout the many disagreements we have had with the cats over the years, they have proven themselves to be a fairly reasonable lot. They surely recognise that a violent struggle would be destructive for both of our nations, to say nothing of the suffering it would inflict on the Manedalusians. There exists a peaceful solution, and we shall find it together."
MGY_the_two_year_proclamation:0 "The Two Year Proclamation"
MGY_the_two_year_proclamation_desc:0 "Although we have been forceful in our rhetoric, some ponies still question our willingness to take a firm stand against the cats. And so we shall demonstrate our commitment to the Manedalusians by making this solemn promise: that Maregypt will take decisive action to liberate them all from Abyssinian overlordship within two years, come what may."
MGY_the_economy_fools:0 "Economic Woes"
MGY_the_economy_fools_desc:0 "The nation still bears deep scars from the Storm King's invasion and subsequent plundering, to say nothing of his hijacking of Maregyptian industries to construct a massive fleet of airships. The economy remains devastated, and we are only now able to start picking up the pieces."
MGY_subsidise_cotton:0 "Subsidise the Cotton Industry"
MGY_subsidise_cotton_desc:0 "Cotton has always been a source of substantial income for Maregypt, and growth of the cotton industry was chiefly responsible for our years of prosperity during the early 990s. Maregypt's unique soil and climate provide an exceptional environment for cultivation, and so we must do all we can to prop up plantations until market conditions become favourable once again."
MGY_equestrian_barons:0 "Equestrian Barons"
MGY_equestrian_barons_desc:0 "Equestrian investment has brought us great wealth and advancement over the years, and further Equestrian aid will be absolutely critical for rebuilding the economy. There is no shortage of businessponies who can sense an opportunity, and if we need to make a few concessions to attract them then so be it."
MGY_mild_nationalisation:0 "Mild Nationalisation"
MGY_mild_nationalisation_desc:0 "Things are dire, and they are not being helped by our current state of economic dependency. Far too much Maregyptian wealth is being siphoned into the pockets of foreign industrialists, while our own ponies are going hungry! Nationalising some Equestrian-owned businesses will alleviate the problem, but at the price of potentially upsetting Equestria."
MGY_expand_mining:0 "Expand Mining Operations"
MGY_expand_mining_desc:0 "It would be pointless to try to save the failing cotton plantations. Fortunately, recent surveys have discovered massive, previously-unknown mineral deposits right beneath our noses! Making the economy more reliant on mining may pose a political risk, though, as it would have the unfortunate side effect of empowering the Miners' Union—a hotbed of communist agitation."
MGY_mining_towns_in_marekush:0 "Build Up the Mining Towns"
MGY_mining_towns_in_marekush_desc:0 "Of all the locations throughout Maregypt identified as resource-rich, Marekush is without a doubt the most commercially viable. However, although it sits atop a treasure trove of valuable mineral resources, a substantial buildup of industry and infrastructure will be necessary to enable efficient processing and export after extraction."
MGY_oil_in_swdesert:0 "Oil in the Desert"
MGY_oil_in_swdesert_desc:0 "Excitingly, large quantities of oil have been discovered in the vast deserts of the southwest. The process of drilling and extraction must be started without any delay! Developing these resources will be vital for continued industrialisation and securing our future prosperity."
MGY_a_reprieve:0 "A Reprieve"
MGY_a_reprieve_desc:0 "We were faced with an extraordinarily challenging situation, but thanks to our actions one of Maregypt's most vital industries has come back from the brink and is looking healthy once again. Things may still seem grim, but there is no doubt that we have taken our first steps on the long road to recovery."
MGY_the_ovambo_problem:0 "The Ovingo Problem"
MGY_the_ovambo_problem_desc:0 "When the Storm King cut his bloody swath across Zebrica, large numbers of Ovingo zebras fled into southern Maregypt after the yeti conquered their lands, and have remained there ever since. Although there has been little violence between native Maregyptians and the Ovingo thus far, there is much bad blood. A plan of action must be formed before the situation escalates out of hoof."
MGY_build_houses:0 "Build Houses"
MGY_build_houses_desc:0 "The Ovingo Problem is one that can only be solved with openness and compassion. After all, our peoples share a bond of mutual suffering under the Storm King's brutal rule. By investing in improving areas with large Ovingo communities such as Marekush, Neighpata, and Khaneigh, the zebras can be more fully incorporated into Maregyptian society."
MGY_build_walls:0 "Build Walls"
MGY_build_walls_desc:0 "The Ovingo Problem is one that can only be solved with constant vigilance. Since first arriving, these tribal zebras have proven themselves completely unwilling to integrate into Maregyptian society. Our best option is to build up defensible positions around large Ovingo communities, in case they decide to start causing trouble."
MGY_peace_summit:0 "A Peace Summit"
MGY_peace_summit_desc:0 "Despite our efforts thus far, low-level tensions continue to simmer. In order to head off the possibility of a Second Ovingo War, we must accept the fact that the Ovingo are here to stay and deserve to be treated as citizens with equal rights. By agreeing to a respectful meeting with prominent zebra leaders, we can surely come to a workable accommodation."
MGY_bolster_police:0 "Bolster the Police"
MGY_bolster_police_desc:0 "These Ovingo parasites are a menace to public safety! The best way to prevent things from degenerating into anarchy is to greatly increase police presence in areas with high concentrations of zebras. In addition to keeping the peace, if a Second Ovingo War ever breaks out they would be a great help in dealing with it."
MGY_vague_platitudes:0 "Offer Vague Platitudes"
MGY_vague_platitudes_desc:0 "This is a delicate situation, and it's up to us to calm things down. As we go about implementing our programme, the citizens must be assured that we are doing so with the utmost level of sensitivity towards communities of all races and their inhabitants. Putting out some public statements to that effect should do the trick."
 
### Abyssinian War Tree ###

MGY_victory_over_the_cats:0 "Victory Over the Cats"
MGY_victory_over_the_cats_desc:0 "Rejoice! Our soldiers have won a glorious victory over the vile cats, and the citizens of Manedalusia are at last free from Abyssinian tyranny. Thanks to our iron resolve, the unjust partition is a thing of the past: Manedalusia is whole again."
MGY_core_kom_marebo:0 "Integrate Kom Marebo"
MGY_core_kom_marebo_desc:0 "Away from the coast, deep in the Manedalusian interior, lies the Bone Dry Desert—a hostile and sparsely populated area notorious for its lawlessness. A settlement of particular note is Klugetown, which is a haven for smugglers and undesirables of all stripes. It's time we let them know there's a new sheriff in town, and that illegal activity will no longer be tolerated."
MGY_core_maned:0 "Integrate Manedalusia"
MGY_core_maned_desc:0 "Manedalusia was a part of Maregypt for centuries, and was seized only recently by the treacherous Abyssinians. Now that the situation has been rectified, reestablishing our rule should be a smooth transition. Soon, wealth from the port city of Coltuba will begin flowing back into Maregypt—where it belongs."
MGY_no_longer_shamed:0 "No Longer Shamed"
MGY_no_longer_shamed_desc:0 "The Abyssinian invasion of 988 cast a long and dark shadow over our recent history, but that great wrong has at last been righted. We refused to accept the unjust settlement imposed upon us by the Great Powers! Maregypt's brave soldiers fought with righteous fury, and in the end stood proud and unbroken. After so many years of shame, Maregypt's honour has been restored."
MGY_defeat_in_manedalusia:0 "Defeat in Manedalusia"
MGY_defeat_in_manedalusia_desc:0 "Although our cause was just, our campaign to eject the Abyssinian tyrants from Manedalusia once and for all resulted in ignominious failure. Our soldiers fought with valour, but in the end they were unable to match the ferocity of the savage cats. For the citizens of Manedalusia, it is a tragedy. For Maregypt, it is yet another in a long line of humiliations."
MGY_give_us_blood:0 "Give Us Blood"
MGY_give_us_blood_desc:0 "Securing what is rightfully ours will require sacrifice: every Maregyptian must give their all! Recruitment quotas will be expanded and factory hours will be extended. For every soldier slain in Manedalusia, two more shall rise to take their place. In pursuit of victory, no price is too high."
MGY_for_our_fathers:0 "For Our Fathers"
MGY_for_our_fathers_desc:0 "Maregypt has gone through some difficult times recently, but we must not succumb to despair! Our nation has a proud heritage stretching back millennia. It has suffered defeat many times throughout its noble history, and each time it emerged stronger than before! And so we must always remember our ancestors, and honour them by continuing to fight against feline domination of our lands."
MGY_once_more_into_the_breach:0 "Once More unto the Breach!"
MGY_once_more_into_the_breach_desc:0 "The wounds of the Manedalusian Catastrophe are fresh, but the morale of our citizens has completely recovered. Maregypt stands bloodied but not beaten! Now the nation thirsts for revenge more than ever; no longer shall Abyssinian occupation stain our honour. As long as our cause is just and our spirits unbroken, Maregypt can never be defeated!"
 
### Events ###

mgy.1.t:0 "The Pillar of Hope"
mgy.1.d:0 "In 1005, when all seemed bleak and Maregypt was in its darkest hour, the ancient heroine Somnambula returned to us and gave the nation fresh hope after decades of strife and failure. Somnambula, who served as advisor to the legendary King Hisan and who bested the evil Sphinx, is still adapting to the modernised world she has returned to, but she has kept her composure well so far. The people hang on her every word, and she is so popular that she has become something of an unofficial head of state.\n\nHer approval could easily secure victory—or at least a huge surge in turnout—for any political party that managed to obtain it. Obviously, we would like that party to be ours. Somnambula is planning to visit R'ataphet on a public goodwill tour, and we must decide how tightly to control her schedule.\n\nAllowing her to tour the central street might be risky, as she could run into popular agitation stirred up by the LPMG. On the other hoof, we could keep her confined to dining with dignitaries: she wouldn't see the plight of the common ponies, but she might get swayed by scheming nobles sympathetic to the ARM. Finally, we could cancel the trip altogether, although she wouldn't be happy about that at all."
mgy.1.a:0 "Allow her to see the public in R'ataphet."
mgy.1.b:0 "Keep her confined to dining with dignitaries."
mgy.1.c:0 "Cancel the trip entirely!"

mgy.2.t:0 "A Goodwill Tour"
mgy.2.d:0 "As she laid eyes on R'ataphet, Somnambula found she could hardly recognise it after two thousand years. Strange new buildings dominated the skyline, and it seemed that the only part of the landscape that remained the same was the Neighile river. Proceeding down the central street, she was surprised to find cheering masses everywhere she looked. She was inspired: in spite of all they had gone through, the Maregyptians had not lost hope.\n\nSomnambula wanted to speak to them and bolster that hope, to express confidence in King Khefer and assure them that better times lie ahead! But she also wanted to find out more about how these ponies really lived. She had heard many speak of the plight of the poor since her return, and was curious to see what it was like for herself."
mgy.2.a:0 "She gives a speech to the ponies."
mgy.2.b:0 "She goes to see the slum dwellers."
mgy.2.c:0 "She is not allowed to interact with the public at all, for safety reasons."

mgy.3.t:0 "A Goodwill Tour"
mgy.3.d:0 "As she laid eyes on R'ataphet, Somnambula found she could hardly recognise it after two thousand years. Strange new buildings dominated the skyline, and it seemed that the only part of the landscape that remained the same was the Neighile river. Upon entering the city, she did not get a chance to see the public and was rushed to a building where a grand banquet was being held in her honour.\n\nSomnambula spent the day dining with prestigious nobles and dignitaries, and was surprised to find out that many of them were distant descendents of ponies she knew back from the days of King Hisan! In addition to Maregyptians, there were a few ponies from Equestria present as well. They described to her the wondrous new devices being designed by Equestrian inventors, leaving her quite impressed with how far technology had come."
mgy.3.a:0 "She regales the nobles with tales of their ancestors."
mgy.3.b:0 "She is fascinated by modern, Equestrian technology."

mgy.4.t:0 "A Visit to Maneisrata"
mgy.4.d:0 "In a few hours, Somnambula is scheduled to visit the coastal Manedalusian town of Maneisrata and speak to the locals. However, being an unscripted event, this visit is not without risks. We are in the midst of a delicate geopolitical situation, and Somnambula, despite diligently trying to get up to speed after two thousand years of absence, lacks an intricate understanding of the Manedalusian issue. She is largely unpredictable, and many are concerned that she might say something that gets taken the wrong way, perhaps even unintentionally inflaming tensions with Abyssinia."
mgy.4.a:0 "She praises Manedalusian culture, and their ability to work together."
mgy.4.b:0 "She mentions that Maregypt’s borders in her time stretched far into what is now Abyssinia."
mgy.4.c:0 "The event is shut down before she can say anything."

mgy.5.t:0 "The Revivalists"
mgy.5.d:0 "Somnambula's curiosity has been piqued by the Alliance for the Revival of Maregypt, and she wishes to visit their headquarters in Manephis to learn more about the group. Worryingly, the leaders of both the Absolutist and Republican ARM factions are currently in Manephis. No doubt Prince Shepser and Kelhed Takammu are each charismatic enough to make a convincing pitch for endorsing the ARM. The safest course would be to block Somnambula from visiting at all, although such overt interference might only serve to alienate her even further."
mgy.5.a:0 "Prince Shepser reminds her of her old friend Hisan."
mgy.5.b:0 "She is impressed by Kelhed Takammu's eloquence."
mgy.5.c:0 "She is stopped from going at all!"

mgy.6.t:0 "A Day at the Market"
mgy.6.d:0 "As Somnambula walked incognito through a crowded marketplace, her attention was grabbed by a group of striking factory workers. They chanted, holding up signs supporting the LPMG, and the lead striker stood atop a crate with his voice amplified by a bullhorn. "When we were foals, we were told that the King is wise and just, and that he protects all Maregyptians. Why, then, does he allow so many of us to go hungry?" he asked with rhetorical flair. "It is because he is King only for the rich! He has sold the welfare of the commoners in exchange for Equestrian gold!" His words were greeted by murmurs of agreement from the rapidly-growing crowd.\n\n"Khefer has failed us, and is nothing more than a tyrant. He and his court of greedy parasites own all the wealth, while we do all the work!" The pony raised a hoof high in the air. "The time has come for the exploited ponies of Maregypt to rise up and demand a new, fairer society. Down with the oppressors! Down with Khefer!" he shouted. "We shall bring about the rule of the working pony!" His audience erupted into enthusiastic cheering, although Somnambula was taken aback by the striker's intensity and took a moment to process her thoughts."
mgy.6.a:0 "She sympathises with the common folk."
mgy.6.b:0 "She is outraged by their verbal abuse of the King!"

mgy.7.t:0 "Dueling Theories"
mgy.7.d:0 "Since returning to Maregypt, Somnambula spent a large portion of her time reading literature. It was necessary in order to catch up on modern philosophy, science, and art after millennia of absence, and she often found it quite enlightening. One item in particular that caught her attention was an academic journal which was in the midst of a long-running dispute about the merits of two political ideologies: Republicanism and Communism. On one hoof, the Republican thinkers argued that the authority of a government should be created by the consent of its citizens, who are the source of all political power. On the other hoof were the Communists, who went even further in asserting that sweeping social change would also be necessary to lift ponies out of poverty and build a truly just society. Somnambula pondered all the arguments before reaching her own conclusion."
mgy.7.a:0 "She muses that the common folk often know their business better than a King."
mgy.7.b:0 "She remembers the wretched slaves of the Old Kingdom, and weeps for them."
mgy.7.c:0 "She muses that ivory-tower scholars know nothing about life on the ground."

mgy.8.t:0 "The Great Debate"
mgy.8.d:0 "On a breezy night in the capital, an enormous crowd of ponies turned out to witness the last debate before the election, featuring representatives from each of Maregypt's major political parties. Sitting in the front row was Somnambula, open-minded and still not fully committed to supporting any one of them. She was not prepared for the raucous affair that would ensue, as there had been no equivalent during the ancient times of Hisan.\n\nRight at the start, the Republican speaker viciously attacked the KM, denouncing the current government as weak and beholden to foreign interests. The KM speaker hit back, defending King Khefer and accusing Republicanism of running counter to Maregyptian tradition as an ideology that inflamed citizens' passions and would inevitably lead to the tyranny of the masses. The Pharaonists were next to be targeted, with the LPMG speaker unleashing a fiery broadside tarring them as scheming, untrustworthy, and unable to adapt to modernity, even going so far as to invoke the spectre of the Dynamite Plot of 994. In retaliation, the Pharaonist speaker attacked the LPMG as nothing more than a home for bloodthirsty revolutionaries, who if elected would usher in a Reign of Terror the likes of which Maregypt had never seen.\n\nIt was an ugly, four-way brawl in which no participant emerged unscathed, but when the dust settled Somnambula could not deny that there had been a clear winner."
mgy.8.a:0 "She is convinced by the KM speaker."
mgy.8.b:0 "She sympathises with the LPMG speaker."
mgy.8.c:0 "She naturally feels at ease with the Pharaonist idea."
mgy.8.e:0 "She considers that Republicanism might be worth a try after all."

mgy.9.t:0 "Somnambula Withdrawals from Public Life!"
mgy.9.d:0 "As election day fast approaches, the populace has been waiting eagerly to hear which party would secure the support of Somnambula—heroine of legend. However, it seems now they might never know, as reports indicate Somnambula recently stormed out from her residence and has gone into hiding. She had grown increasingly frustrated by King Khefer's attempts to control her as she traveled the country speaking to ponies, and is now refusing to cooperate with the government at all. At a time when Maregypt needs its idol more than ever, she is nowhere to be found."
mgy.9.a:0 "Unfortunate."

mgy.10.t:0 "Somnambula's Endorsement"
mgy.10.d:0 "As election day fast approaches, the populace has been waiting eagerly to hear which party would secure the support of Somnambula—heroine of legend. Throughout the campaign her favour was highly sought-after, as an endorsement from Maregypt's revered icon of hope was always sure to have a massive impact on the race. After months of waiting, that day has finally arrived, and Somnambula has released a statement making her pronouncement of support. She states that it was not a decision she made lightly, but in the end she chose to give her wholehearted support to..."
mgy.10.a:0 "...the KM."
mgy.10.b:0 "...the LPMG."
mgy.10.c:0 "...the ARM Monarchists."
mgy.10.e:0 "...the ARM Republicans."

mgy.11.t:0 "The Manedalusian Crisis: Results and Prospects"
mgy.11.d:0 "With the government recently articulating its position on Manedalusia, the passions of many Maregyptians have become inflamed, both in support of and against the official line. This clash of ideas was given a venue in the form of a public debate scheduled to take place in Somnambula. When the day arrived, large numbers of citizens came out to witness the debate.\n\nTaking the pro-war position was a retired army officer and veteran of the 991 campaign into Abyssinia, who argued that previous experience had demonstrated that a new war with Abyssinia would be quick, easy, and sure to result in a Maregyptian victory. He also repeatedly denigrated the peace settlement imposed by the Great Powers as unjust and a stain on Maregypt's honour.\n\nTaking the opposite position was a pony journalist who was born in Manedalusia, and who opposed further conflict on the grounds that it would greatly endanger the lives of the ponies and cats who lived in the region, especially since the Manedalusians were only just beginning to recover from the damage done by the Storm King's brutal ransacking. She went on to emphasise the fact that war is unpredictable, and that a Maregyptian victory in such a hypothetical war was far from a certainty.\n\nWhen the dust had settled, both sides had gotten their share of licks in. All that remains to be seen is which side's arguments will sway the audience more."
mgy.11.a:0 "War is our only recourse!"
mgy.11.b:0 "We must not rush to such reckless action."
 
mgy.12.t:0 "Maregypt Nationalises Businesses"
mgy.12.d:0 "In the aftermath of the brutal conquest and pillaging of their lands by the Storm King, Maregypt's economy was left in a state of collapse. We have been providing substantial aid to blunt the effects of this catastrophe and help rebuild the country, in the interests of stabilising an important partner in the region. Equestrian businesses have a long history of investing in the country, which brought it great prosperity in the past, and we have always considered Maregypt a friend.\n\nHowever, it seems many Maregyptians are unhappy with the amount of influence that foreign powers exert over their nation, particularly in the economic sector. Feeling this pressure, the Maregyptian government has passed legislation to nationalise the assets of several Equestrian-owned businesses, offering only token compensation in return. Affected businessponies are outraged by the expropriation, and we are being bombarded with demands that Maregypt be harshly punished for their indiscretion."
mgy.12.a:0 "Cut our economic assistance entirely!"
mgy.12.b:0 "Reduce our economic assistance."
mgy.12.c:0 "Forgive them, they have suffered enough already."

mgy.13.t:0 "Equestrian Aid Ended!"
mgy.13.d:0 "Equestria has reacted extremely harshly to our recent nationalisation of several Equestrian-owned businesses, no doubt spurred on by complaints from affected businessponies. Although we were forced to take this action out of desperation, the Equestrians have shown no sympathy for our difficult domestic situation. In retaliation, they have announced an immediate end to all economic aid to Maregypt. It seems those greedy mules were only ever interested in extracting what wealth they could from Maregypt, and are content to leave our ponies to rot."
mgy.13.a:0 "So much for the magic of friendship..."

mgy.14.t:0 "Equestrian Aid Reduced"
mgy.14.d:0 "Equestria has reacted fairly negatively to our recent nationalisation of several Equestrian-owned businesses, no doubt spurred on by complaints from affected businessponies. Although we were forced to take this action out of desperation, the Equestrians have shown little sympathy for our difficult domestic situation. In retaliation, they have announced a reduction in their level of economic aid to Maregypt. Although unfortunate, Equestria's response could have been far harsher, as our aid was not ended entirely."
mgy.14.a:0 "So much for the magic of friendship..."

mgy.15.t:0 "Equestrian Aid Continues"
mgy.15.d:0 "After our recent nationalisation of several Equestrian-owned businesses, the Equestrian government has been extraordinarily understanding, despite no doubt hearing numerous complaints from the affected businessponies. We were forced to take this action out of necessity, and the Equestrians have shown great sympathy for our difficult domestic situation. No doubt they appreciate the value of maintaining a stable ally in the region. They assure us that there will be no reduction in their level of economic aid to Maregypt."
mgy.15.a:0 "What a relief!"

mgy.16.t:0 "Maregyptian-Ovingo Peace Talks"
mgy.16.d:0 "The Knights of Maregypt have committed themselves to finding a peaceful resolution to the Ovingo crisis, and they have taken their boldest action yet to do so. Earlier this week, Ovingo community leaders from Marekush, Neighpata, and Khaneigh all converged on the capital for a high-profile summit with government representatives. The talks dragged on for days, but in the end they bore fruit. The resulting agreement affirms that the Ovingo are a part of Maregypt and have the same rights as any native Maregyptian, while also placing harsh restrictions on Ovingo and anti-Ovingo militia groups. Ovingo leaders are pleased with the outcome, and have stated that they see it as ensuring a peaceful future for their communities. Ponies across the country are also optimistic after hearing the news, viewing the agreement as an important first step towards fully integrating the zebras into Maregyptian society."
mgy.16.a:0 "A diplomatic coup!"

mgy.17.t:0 "Moment of Truth"
mgy.17.d:0 "After a long and brutal campaign season, election day has arrived at last. All the arguments from the parties have been made and ponies across Maregypt are finally turning out to make their voices heard at polling places. As the day progresses, reports indicate that the process is proceeding smoothly and without incident. But once all the ballots have been cast, the country will still have to wait with bated breath for the victor to be determined."
mgy.17.a:0 "Who will win?"

mgy.18.t:0 "The Results are In..."
mgy.18.d:0 "As election day wound down, the process of tallying votes was still in progress and would take some time to be completed. The process stretched deep in the night, although it was finished by the dawn of the next morning. After all the ballots had been counted in the 1008 elections to the House of Commons, a clear winner had emerged. The ponies had spoken! After a hard-fought struggle, the election was finally over. Maregypt was ready to once again face the future as one nation."
mgy.18.a:0 "Congratulations to the victors!"

At last, Maregypt says "No More!". We WILL reclaim our land from the cats! We WILL defend our borders from the enemy, and we will NEVER go back under the foreign jackboot! Maregypt free! Maregypt forever!"
 MGY_stomped_flat:0 "Legacy of the Storm War"
 MGY_stomped_flat_desc:0 "In 1004, the Yeti known as the Storm King invaded and conquered our country. For the next few years he pillaged our fair land, plundering it to build his bloated airship fleet. He was slain only recently, in 1005, and our army is still reeling from the effects of this bitter defeat."
 MGY_ovambo_war:0 "Legacy of the Ovingo War"
 MGY_ovambo_war_desc:0 "The Ovingo "War" wasn't really a war - more of a period of protracted civil unrest, caused by the Ovingo Zebras migrating across our borders as the Storm King conquered their homeland in the south. We were conquered by the Storm King before the issue could really be solved, and now we have to deal with communities of foreigners who aren't formally part of our nation occupying substantial lands in our southernmost provinces. This problem has so far been pushed aside in favor of more pressing problems like the economy, but it surely can't be ignored forever..."

 MGY_somnambula_desc:0 "The past millenium has been cruel to Maregypt - we have gone from ancient glory to an embattled state that has been ravaged by war twice in the last twenty years. For many years, our predicament looked hopeless, and it seemed the glory of Maregypt would fade into a mere memory. But then, against all hope, Somnambula returned! The ancient heroine from two thousand years ago, whose aid was essential in the establishment of the glorious Second Kingdom, is once more with us! For the first time in centuries, Maregypt is filled with hope for a better future. But the world has changed a lot since those days...will the ancient heroine be able to live up to the pressure placed on her?\n"
