### FOCUS LOCALISATION ####################
###########################################
FAR_start_modernise:0 "Begin Development"
FAR_start_modernise_desc:0 "Our way of life has served us well so far, but the world is changing. We hear stories of distant lands and the great machines that they possess. We must start bringing our country up to date if we wish not to be left behind."
FAR_tractors:0 "Agricultural Tools"
FAR_tractors_desc:0 "Our farmers still till their fields with ox-drawn ploughs. Importing newfangled mechanical tools from Griffonia would significantly improve the lives of our people."
FAR_new_crops:0 "Higher-Yield Crops"
FAR_new_crops_desc:0 "We see that the Griffins have increased their food production massively by adopting newer crops, that produce more and better fruit. We should copy their example, to ensure our people never go hungry."
FAR_stone_roads:0 "From Dirt Paths to Stone Roads"
FAR_stone_roads_desc:0 "Most of our country is still connected by little more than dirt paths, beaten down by the hooves of generations of ponies. A series of stone roads will greatly improve the ease of both travel and trade within our nation."
FAR_metals:0 "Dig For Heavy Metals"
FAR_metals_desc:0 "The hills of Farbrook are rich in minerals, but until now we have been able to make only limited use of these. We should establish proper mines to increase our access to these precious natural resources."
FAR_urban1:0 "Promote Urbanisation"
FAR_urban1_desc:0 "As our population increases, more and more ponies are finding that there are simply no jobs for them to do in the countryside. By encouraging these surplus ponies to move to our towns, we can build up our urban centres into bustling metropoles - at least, what passes for a metropolis out in East Griffonia."
FAR_start_trade:0 "Expand Foreign Trade"
FAR_start_trade_desc:0 "Our nation is relatively remote and isolated, and we've never made much of an effort to encourage people to come here. With our new infrastructure it should be easier to convince merchants to travel through our lands, making our country a hub for lucrative trade."
FAR_steam_engine:0 "The Steam Engine"
FAR_steam_engine_desc:0 "We have heard of the wonders of steam from the Griffons, but only now are we realising the full implications of this device. After our new developments, our country is finally ready for the mass adoption of steam power."
FAR_schools_1:0 "Encourage Education"
FAR_schools_1_desc:0 "With our newfound prosperity, it is becoming increasingly obvious that skilled ponies are needed to work the machines of the modern day. We should establish a rudimentary school system to help produce the kind of specialists we need."
FAR_urban2:0 "New Settlements and Towns"
FAR_urban2_desc:0 "Our towns and cities are no longer able to contain our burgeoning population. We must found new towns to give everyone a place to live - which, coincidentally, will further expand business and industry within our country."
FAR_rail:0 "The Iron Pony"
FAR_rail_desc:0 "With the advent of steam, a new way of travel reveals itself to Farbrook - the railway! Capable of speed and stamina that nopony can match, this invention will bring our country even closer together."
FAR_uni:0 "The First Universities"
FAR_uni_desc:0 "Our initial attempts at providing education have proven successful, but we still lack institutes of higher learning. We now have the population to support full-time universities, and they've begin popping up to serve the needs of our ponies."
FAR_entrep:0 "Entrepreneurs and Big Business"
FAR_entrep_desc:0 "With our growing industrialisation, a new class of rich businessponies has come into being. These ponies provide funds out of their own pockets to build privately-held factories, and go abroad to learn business methods from colleges in Griffenheim. The rise of this new class has greatly increased our knowledge of industry."
FAR_industrial_revolution:0 "Industrial Revolution"
FAR_industrial_revolution_desc:0 "Our country has come a long way, and now, with the widespread use of internal combustion, it is about to take another leap into the future."
FAR_council:0 "The Council Deliberates"
FAR_council_desc:0 "Every seven years, the Chieftains of the tribes of Farbrook come together to discuss their plans for the future, as well as who will head the Council until next time. Cenhelm has led us well these last years, but some wonder if he is too soft to save us in the dark times that look to be brewing ahead."
FAR_harmony:0 "Cenhelm was re-elected"
FAR_nonaligned:0 "The Council abolished the role of Chief Speaker"
FAR_fascist:0 "Gering was chosen to lead"
FAR_communist:0 "Communists have taken control of the Council"
FAR_extremist:0 "The Council has lost faith in Cenhelm"
FAR_cenhelm:0 "Stick With What We Know"
FAR_cenhelm_desc:0 "Cenhelm has already proven himself a wise leader - why would we change what's working just fine?"
FAR_council_coup:0 "Council Consolidates Power"
FAR_council_coup_desc:0 "Why should any one Chief have pre-eminence among the many, diverse peoples of our nation? If we are to face the dark times ahead, we must face them together as equals."
FAR_gering:0 "Glory To Farbrook"
FAR_gering_desc:0 "Hermane Gering has earned the Council's approval to lead Farbrook for the next seven years. He will lead it to glory, or die trying."
FAR_thenorth:0 "Shelter From The Black Crusade"
FAR_thenorth_desc:0 "Disaster! Our longstanding guardians, the Arcturian Order, have fallen to the Dread Leaugue! We must scramble to defend ourselves - this could be the end of the world!"
FAR_extremism:0 "Radical Leadership"
FAR_extremism_desc:0 "The Council has lost faith in Cenhelm's ability to lead us. The lot now falls between two ponies. Applethorn is Chief of the Tanglebriar Tribe, and absorbed strange ideas during his youth spent in Prywhen. On the other hoof, Hermane Gering, the stern warrior chief of the White Hooves clan, with his dreams of Empire."
FAR_comm:0 "Communists Take Control of the Council"
FAR_comm_desc:0 "The Council has elected a Communist to be the leader of Farbrook for the next seven years. Their first action was to dissolve the council and declare Farbrook a sovereign People's Republic, by the workingpony, and for the workingpony."
FAR_suppression:0 "Quell Dissent"
FAR_suppression_desc:0 "There are those who think that our new form of government is unjust and untraditional. In the interests of maintaining peace and stability, we must show these neigh-sayers what's what."
FAR_imperialism:0 "Imperialist Dreams"
FAR_imperialism_desc:0 "Who says that Farbrook is a backwater? Fools! The greatness of a nation is measured by the strength of its spirit, and in time, its borders will inevitably change to reflect that spirit. We are Hill Ponies! We are strong!"
FAR_military_education:0 "A Military Education"
FAR_military_education_desc:0 "A great kingdom is built on the back of victory in battle, and victory in battle is built on the back of skilled leadership. We must provide formal education for our officer corps if we are to have any realistic hope of glory."
FAR_warrior_tithe:0 "The Warrior Tithe"
FAR_warrior_tithe_desc:0 "Up until now, we have had a very haphazard military, mostly thrown together from the warriors that individuals tribes could spare. This will not do for our glorious new state! We must institute the Warrior's Tithe - each tribe must send a certain percentage of their young stallions to serve in the armed forces or face severe punishment."
FAR_armories:0 "Establish Armories"
FAR_armories_desc:0 "Our industrial weapons production lags woefully behind the times. We must have proper military industry if we are to attain the greatness that is our destiny."
FAR_schooling_for_service:0 "Schooling For Service"
FAR_schooling_for_service_desc:0 "Our officer schools have been a smashing success, however it is difficult for an educated officer to get the best out of illiterate soldiers. We should establish military academies to provide education to our soldiers in the field."
FAR_griffon_tactics:0 "Griffon-Style Tactics"
FAR_griffon_tactics_desc:0 "While our past relations with them are rocky at best, we must admit that the Griffins' military tactics are superior to our own. We should study them in order to improve the performance of our armies on the battlefield."
FAR_four_hooves:0 "Our Own Four Hooves"
FAR_four_hooves_desc:0 "We need no allies! Farbrook shall stand tall and proud, the greatest of all pony nations!"
FAR_beseech_the_emperor:0 "Beseech The Emperor"
FAR_beseech_the_emperor_desc:0 "The wretched River Federation stands in the way of our ambitions. Despite our rocky history with them, the Griffonian Empire is a strong and rising power that we could use as a means to an end. We shall send a proposition to Griffenheim, offering our loyalty in exchange for aid. The fools..."
FAR_two_pronged_attack:0 "Two-Pronged Attack"
FAR_two_pronged_attack_desc:0 "We cannot achieve our national glory with the River Federation standing in our way. They are strong, probably too strong for us to fight alone. But they have many enemies. Perhaps we could convince those enemies to team up with us to partition the Federation's land between us?"
FAR_stormtroopers:0 "Stormtroopers"
FAR_stormtroopers_desc:0 "It is obvious that we can rely on ourselves, and only on ourselves. Only by embracing fully our glorious history of mountain warfare can we truly find greatness."
FAR_axis:0 "Axis Of Honor"
FAR_axis_desc:0 "Griffenheim has commanded the Griffin Knights to aid us militarily. It is time that we formalised this arrangement into a true military alliance."
FAR_coop:0 "Military Missions"
FAR_coop_desc:0 "Our newfound allies will not be of much use if their troops are of poor quality. We should send our officers to them, so that they can take advantage of our superior military genius."
FAR_coldmouth:0 "The Coldmouth Corridor"
FAR_coldmouth_desc:0 "It is undeniable that all hillponies should be under one nation - but there are hill ponies living in Coldmouth, under Firtree! This is an outrage - we must be prepared to use every measure up to and including war to right this wrong."

### EVENTS #################################
###########################################
FAR.1.t:0 "The Council's Decision"
FAR.1.d:0 "After months of deliberation, the Council has finally made up their mind who should lead the Farbrook tribes in this difficult time. Their choice was..."
FAR.1.a:0 "We need stable leadership - no changes"
FAR.1.b:0 "A firm hoof is necessary - Cenhelm must go"
FAR.2.t:0 "Power Struggles within the Council"
FAR.2.d:0 "The Council has rejected the experienced leadership of Cenhelm - but who will they choose to replace him?"
FAR.2.a:0 "The Communists have some interesting ideas - let's invite them into the Council"
FAR.2.b:0 "Chief Gering shows promise - he will lead us through this difficult time"
FAR.3.t:0 "A Proposal From The East"
FAR.3.d:0 "An pony envoy sought an audience with the Regent today, and offered a most interesting proposal. She claimed to come from the far east, from a backwards nation called Farbrook. We recognised the name as one of the clans of savages that the Knightly Orders have been charged with guarding our Eastern border from for centuries now. The envoy claimed that Farbrook regrets their history of animosity with us, and claims her leader, Hermane Gering, asks for help. Gering wishes to unite the Ponies of the Eastern Hills and plains, but the River Federation is posing a major obstacle to this, and he asks for our aid in defeating them. In exchange, Gering offers his obedience to the crown, offering the Eastern lands to us if we will but allow him to administrate them."
FAR.3.a:0 "Offer him aid and command the Knightly Orders to fight alongside him. We have much to gain and little to lose"
FAR.3.b:0 "We are not interested in the affairs of savages"
FAR.4.t:0 "Divide and Conquer"
FAR.4.d:0 "A messenger came from the frigid North today. He claimed to speak on behalf of Hermane Gering, Chieftain of the hillponies of Farbrook. Chieftain Gering is offering us a simple deal: agree to go to war with the Federation alongside Gering, and we will be granted a large chunk of the spoils, gaining access to the rich floodplains and farmlands of the River Valleys. What will our response be?"
FAR.4.a:0 "The lands are fertile...tell him we accept"
FAR.4.b:0 "This isn't in our best interest"
FAR.5.t:0 "Divide and Conquer"
FAR.5.d:0 "A messenger came from the frigid North today. He claimed to speak on behalf of Hermane Gering, Chieftain of the hillponies of Farbrook. Chieftain Gering is offering us a simple deal: agree to go to war with the Federation alongside Gering, and we will be granted a large chunk of the spoils, gaining access to the rich floodplains and farmlands of the River Valleys. What will our response be?"
FAR.5.a:0 "The lands are fertile...tell him we accept"
FAR.5.b:0 "This isn't in our best interest"
FAR.6.t:0 "The Empire is Interested"
FAR.6.d:0 "Our messenger arrived from Griffonheim yesterday, with excellent news - the Empire has accepted our offer. Military advisors, weapons, and personnel will be delivered to us for the war effort, and while the Empire is not willing to commit itself personally to a war in the East, it has ordered the two Griffin Knightly Orders to provide us with direct military assistance in any future wars. Of course, they DO expect our pledge of alleigance in exchange..."
FAR.6.a:0 "Of course, of course, whatever they want"
FAR.7.t:0 "Imperial Scorn"
FAR.7.d:0 "Ill news has returned to us this day: the Empire is not interested in helping us against the Federation. They are unwilling to commit themselves to a war in the East without better hope of a profit for themselves."
FAR.7.a:0 "We will have to look elsewhere"
FAR.8.t:0 "The Gryphian Host signs the River Pact"
FAR.8.d:0 "Excellent news! The Gryphian Host has agreed to our terms, and will attack the Federation alongside us. However, they will demand part of the Federation's land in exchange for this."
FAR.8.a:0 "I can already hear Lake City burning!"
FAR.9.t:0 "The Gryphian Host isn't interested"
FAR.9.d:0 "Sad news came from the South today - the Gryphian Host refused to join our offensive pact to partition the River Federation."
FAR.9.a:0 "Never trust a Griffon!"
FAR.10.t:0 "The Zebras sign the River Pact"
FAR.10.d:0 "An envoy arrived this morning, bring word from the Zebra nation that they have accepted our deal. In return for land, they will help us to defeat the River Ponies."
FAR.10.a:0 "They may look odd, but they will be useful nonetheless"
FAR.11.t:0 "The Zebras turn their noses down at us"
FAR.11.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Zebras have sent a messenger telling us that they have no interest in our pact to partition the River Federation."
FAR.11.a:0 "We should've known they were cowards"
FAR.13.t:0 "The Deer sign the River Pact"
FAR.13.d:0 "We received word from the South today that the Deer are willing and eager to support us in our war with the River Federation."
FAR.13.a:0 "The Federation's days are numbered!"
FAR.14.t:0 "The Deer ignore our proposal"
FAR.14.d:0 "Bad news arrived today - the Deer are not interested in joining with us against the River Ponies."
FAR.14.a:0 "Damn their eyes"
FAR.15.t:0 "Military Mission From Farbrook"
FAR.15.d:0 "In view of our new alliance with Hermane Gering, Farbrook has sent some of its finest military minds on a mission to our nation. This should significantly improve the quality of our officer corps."
FAR.15.a:0 "Maybe those northerners aren't so bad after all"
FAR.16.a:0 "The Coldmouth Corridor"
FAR.16.d:0 "Hermane Gering's rhetoric has been getting more and more inflammatory as of late. He has been speaking for months about how the land from Coldmouth to the sea is, and always has been, hill pony land, and that all hill ponies should be in one nation. Now, an ultimatum has been delivered to us - cede this territory to Farbrook's regime or face open war."
FAR.16.a:0 "We have no choice. Surrender the land"
FAR.16.b:0 "Over my dead body!"
FAR.17.t:0 "Firtree Folds"
FAR.17.d:0 "Intimidated by our great might, Firtree has willingly ceded the Coldmouth Corridor."
FAR.17.a:0 "As it should be"
FAR.18.t:0 "Firtree Defiant"
FAR.18.d:0 "Foolishly, the ponies of Firtree have refused our generous offer to unite all hillponies under one nation."
FAR.18.a:0 "Do they think the Federation will protect them? Hah!"
