### FOCUS LOCALISATION ####################
###########################################
FAR_start_modernise:0 "Begin Development"
FAR_start_modernise_desc:0 "Our way of life has served us well so far, but the world is changing. We hear stories of distant lands and the great machines that they possess. We must start bringing our country up to date if we wish not to be left behind."
FAR_tractors:0 "Agricultural Tools"
FAR_tractors_desc:0 "Our farmers still till their fields with ox-drawn ploughs. Importing newfangled mechanical tools from Griffonia would significantly improve the lives of our people."
FAR_new_crops:0 "Higher-Yield Crops"
FAR_new_crops_desc:0 "We see that the Griffins have increased their food production massively by adopting newer crops, that produce more and better fruit. We should copy their example, to ensure our people never go hungry."
FAR_stone_roads:0 "From Dirt Paths to Stone Roads"
FAR_stone_roads_desc:0 "Most of our country is still connected by little more than dirt paths, beaten down by the hooves of generations of ponies. A series of stone roads will greatly improve the ease of both travel and trade within our nation."
FAR_metals:0 "Dig For Heavy Metals"
FAR_metals_desc:0 "The hills of Farbrook are rich in minerals, but until now we have been able to make only limited use of these. We should establish proper mines to increase our access to these precious natural resources."
FAR_urban1:0 "Promote Urbanisation"
FAR_urban1_desc:0 "As our population increases, more and more ponies are finding that there are simply no jobs for them to do in the countryside. By encouraging these surplus ponies to move to our towns, we can build up our urban centres into bustling metropoles - at least, what passes for a metropolis out in East Griffonia."
FAR_start_trade:0 "Expand Foreign Trade"
FAR_start_trade_desc:0 "Our nation is relatively remote and isolated, and we've never made much of an effort to encourage people to come here. With our new infrastructure it should be easier to convince merchants to travel through our lands, making our country a hub for lucrative trade."
FAR_steam_engine:0 "The Steam Engine"
FAR_steam_engine_desc:0 "We have heard of the wonders of steam from the Griffons, but only now are we realising the full implications of this device. After our new developments, our country is finally ready for the mass adoption of steam power."
FAR_schools_1:0 "Encourage Education"
FAR_schools_1_desc:0 "With our newfound prosperity, it is becoming increasingly obvious that skilled ponies are needed to work the machines of the modern day. We should establish a rudimentary school system to help produce the kind of specialists we need."
FAR_urban2:0 "New Settlements and Towns"
FAR_urban2_desc:0 "Our towns and cities are no longer able to contain our burgeoning population. We must found new towns to give everyone a place to live - which, coincidentally, will further expand business and industry within our country."
FAR_rail:0 "The Iron Pony"
FAR_rail_desc:0 "With the advent of steam, a new way of travel reveals itself to Farbrook - the railway! Capable of speed and stamina that nopony can match, this invention will bring our country even closer together."
FAR_uni:0 "The First Universities"
FAR_uni_desc:0 "Our initial attempts at providing education have proven successful, but we still lack institutes of higher learning. We now have the population to support full-time universities, and they've begin popping up to serve the needs of our ponies."
FAR_entrep:0 "Entrepreneurs and Big Business"
FAR_entrep_desc:0 "With our growing industrialisation, a new class of rich businessponies has come into being. These ponies provide funds out of their own pockets to build privately-held factories, and go abroad to learn business methods from colleges in Griffenheim. The rise of this new class has greatly increased our knowledge of industry."
FAR_industrial_revolution:0 "Industrial Revolution"
FAR_industrial_revolution_desc:0 "Our country has come a long way, and now, with the widespread use of internal combustion, it is about to take another leap into the future."
FAR_council:0 "The Council Deliberates"
FAR_council_desc:0 "Every seven years, the Chieftains of the tribes of Farbrook come together to discuss their plans for the future, as well as who will head the Council until next time. Cenhelm has led us well these last years, but some wonder if he is too soft to save us in the dark times that look to be brewing ahead."
FAR_harmony:0 "Cenhelm was re-elected"
FAR_nonaligned:0 "The Council abolished the role of Chief Speaker"
FAR_fascist:0 "Gering was chosen to lead"
FAR_communist:0 "Communists have taken control of the Council"
FAR_extremist:0 "The Council has lost faith in Cenhelm"
FAR_cenhelm:0 "Stick With What We Know"
FAR_cenhelm_desc:0 "Cenhelm has already proven himself a wise leader - why would we change what's working just fine?"
FAR_council_coup:0 "Council Consolidates Power"
FAR_council_coup_desc:0 "Why should any one Chief have pre-eminence among the many, diverse peoples of our nation? If we are to face the dark times ahead, we must face them together as equals."
FAR_gering:0 "Glory To Farbrook"
FAR_gering_desc:0 "Hermane Gering has earned the Council's approval to lead Farbrook for the next seven years. He will lead it to glory, or die trying."
FAR_thenorth:0 "Shelter From The Black Crusade"
FAR_thenorth_desc:0 "Disaster! Our longstanding guardians, the Arcturian Order, have fallen to the Dread Leaugue! We must scramble to defend ourselves - this could be the end of the world!"
FAR_extremism:0 "Radical Leadership"
FAR_extremism_desc:0 "The Council has lost faith in Cenhelm's ability to lead us. The lot now falls between two ponies. Applethorn is Chief of the Tanglebriar Tribe, and absorbed strange ideas during his youth spent in Prywhen. On the other hoof, Hermane Gering, the stern warrior chief of the White Hooves clan, with his dreams of Empire."
FAR_comm:0 "Communists Take Control of the Council"
FAR_comm_desc:0 "The Council has elected a Communist to be the leader of Farbrook for the next seven years. Their first action was to dissolve the council and declare Farbrook a sovereign People's Republic, by the workingpony, and for the workingpony."
FAR_suppression:0 "Quell Dissent"
FAR_suppression_desc:0 "There are those who think that our new form of government is unjust and untraditional. In the interests of maintaining peace and stability, we must show these neigh-sayers what's what."
FAR_imperialism:0 "Imperialist Dreams"
FAR_imperialism_desc:0 "Who says that Farbrook is a backwater? Fools! The greatness of a nation is measured by the strength of its spirit, and in time, its borders will inevitably change to reflect that spirit. We are Hill Ponies! We are strong!"
FAR_military_education:0 "A Military Education"
FAR_military_education_desc:0 "A great kingdom is built on the back of victory in battle, and victory in battle is built on the back of skilled leadership. We must provide formal education for our officer corps if we are to have any realistic hope of glory."
FAR_warrior_tithe:0 "The Warrior Tithe"
FAR_warrior_tithe_desc:0 "Up until now, we have had a very haphazard military, mostly thrown together from the warriors that individuals tribes could spare. This will not do for our glorious new state! We must institute the Warrior's Tithe - each tribe must send a certain percentage of their young stallions to serve in the armed forces or face severe punishment."
FAR_armories:0 "Establish Armories"
FAR_armories_desc:0 "Our industrial weapons production lags woefully behind the times. We must have proper military industry if we are to attain the greatness that is our destiny."
FAR_schooling_for_service:0 "Schooling For Service"
FAR_schooling_for_service_desc:0 "Our officer schools have been a smashing success, however it is difficult for an educated officer to get the best out of illiterate soldiers. We should establish military academies to provide education to our soldiers in the field."
FAR_griffon_tactics:0 "Griffon-Style Tactics"
FAR_griffon_tactics_desc:0 "While our past relations with them are rocky at best, we must admit that the Griffins' military tactics are superior to our own. We should study them in order to improve the performance of our armies on the battlefield."
FAR_four_hooves:0 "Our Own Four Hooves"
FAR_four_hooves_desc:0 "We need no allies! Farbrook shall stand tall and proud, the greatest of all pony nations!"
FAR_beseech_the_emperor:0 "Beseech The Emperor"
FAR_beseech_the_emperor_desc:0 "The wretched River Federation stands in the way of our ambitions. Despite our rocky history with them, the Griffonian Empire is a strong and rising power that we could use as a means to an end. We shall send a proposition to Griffenheim, offering our loyalty in exchange for aid. The fools..."
FAR_two_pronged_attack:0 "Two-Pronged Attack"
FAR_two_pronged_attack_desc:0 "We cannot achieve our national glory with the River Federation standing in our way. They are strong, probably too strong for us to fight alone. But they have many enemies. Perhaps we could convince those enemies to team up with us to partition the Federation's land between us?"
FAR_stormtroopers:0 "Stormtroopers"
FAR_stormtroopers_desc:0 "It is obvious that we can rely on ourselves, and only on ourselves. Only by embracing fully our glorious history of mountain warfare can we truly find greatness."
FAR_axis:0 "Axis Of Honor"
FAR_axis_desc:0 "Griffenheim has commanded the Griffin Knights to aid us militarily. It is time that we formalised this arrangement into a true military alliance."
FAR_coop:0 "Military Missions"
FAR_coop_desc:0 "Our newfound allies will not be of much use if their troops are of poor quality. We should send our officers to them, so that they can take advantage of our superior military genius."
FAR_coldmouth:0 "The Coldmouth Corridor"
FAR_coldmouth_desc:0 "It is undeniable that all hillponies should be under one nation - but there are hill ponies living in Coldmouth, under Firtree! This is an outrage - we must be prepared to use every measure up to and including war to right this wrong."
FAR_fate_of_villages:0 "Fate of the Villages"
FAR_fate_of_villages_desc:0 "All the Northern Ponies must be united under one banner - and that banner will be ours."
FAR_war_RIV:0 "War with the Riverfolk"
FAR_war_RIV_desc:0 "Our moment has finally come. So far the river ponies have been too cowardly to oppose our conquests, despite being in a position to do so, but there can be no more waiting. We will strike down the River Federation or we will die trying!"
FAR_final_struggle:0 "The Final Struggle"
FAR_final_struggle_desc:0 "Our hour of destiny is at hand! Every soldier must be ready to give his life for the nation! A moment such as this shall never come again, and what is a life compared to the glory that awaits us?"
FAR_hillponies:0 "Hillponies United Under One Banner"
FAR_hillponies_desc:0 "Now that the lands of the northern Hill Ponies have finally been united under one banner, it is time to properly integrate them into our country - whether they like it or not."
FAR_hillpony_dominance:0 "Hillpony Dominance"
FAR_hillpony_dominance_desc:0 "The hillponies fought and died for our victory, and it is the hillponies that will rule it! All the other races that made up the former Federation are second-class citizens at best."
FAR_reconciliation:0 "Reconciliation Efforts"
FAR_reconciliation_desc:0 "Despite our longtime hatred for the Federation and all that it stood for, we must admit it had some good ideas. In particular, its ability to keep many races in (relative) harmony was impressive. We should use a light touch with our defeated enemies, so that they may come to accept us an rightful rulers."
FAR_lord_of_hill_and_dell:0 "Lord of Hill and Dell"
FAR_lord_of_hill_and_dell_desc:0 "At last, Gering's dream has been accomplished. He stands, undisputed master of the ponies of East Griffonia, and has been formally crowned Emperor in a ceremony at River City. His ambition has not been sated, however, and he still has plans - but the Griffin Empire may be unhappy if we made promises of fealty..."
FAR_honor_oath:0 "Honor Our Oath"
FAR_honor_oath_desc:0 "We achieved this victory through the aid of our stalwart allies, the Griffin Empire, and promised them fealty. Now that we have achieved victory, we shall appeal for formal membership of the Empire. Farbrook will become the greatest Grand Duchy of the Empire, and Gering its greatest Arch-Duke."
FAR_politburo:0 "First Worker's Constitutional Congress"
FAR_politburo_desc:0 "The Revolution has been successful! Now that the reactionaries have been suppressed, it falls to us to safeguard the Socialist State by electing a leader to guide us. We have a choice between Applethorn, the well-travelled mare of the world, and Moonblossom, a former community leader of Watertown."
FAR_vanguard:0 "Applethorn's Revolutionary Vanguard Party"
FAR_vanguard_desc:0 "Comrade Applethorn spent her youth adventuring in the south, and spent years working for the Prywhen People's Liberation Army. She sees th backwardness of Farbrook as an obstacle, and wishes to rapidly industrialise and army the nation to advance the cause of the workers of the world."
FAR_7yrplan:0 "Seven-Year Plan"
FAR_7yrplan_desc:0 "Farbrook is woefully behind the times, even by the standards of relatively-backwards Griffonia. If our Revolution is to survive, it is absolutely imperative that we industralise and bring ourselves into the modern world - no matter the cost or the strain."
FAR_soc_ed:0 "Socialist Education"
FAR_soc_ed_desc:0 "Our populace is woefully uneducated, and will never develop proper class consciousness in this condition. We must spare no effort to make sure that each and every pony receives a proper education along Communistic and revolutionary lines."
FAR_red_army:0 "A Red Army"
FAR_red_army_desc:0 "The Revolution cannot be safeguarded by mere words and wishes alone. We must have a proper army of loyal working ponies if we are to have any hope of success."
FAR_new_manifesto:0 "Compose The New Manifesto"
FAR_new_manifesto_desc:0 "Our socialist state is still very young. In the interests of stability, we should write and publish a manifesto, to be made available free to all ponies, explaining the purpose, beliefs, powers, restrictions, and functionings of the new government."
FAR_agrarian:0 "Moonblossom's Socialist Agrarian Workers Party"
FAR_agrarian_desc:0 "Moonblossom used to be a community leader in nearby Watertown before she was expelled on trumped-up grounds. She believes that it is more important to make the lives of the workers of Farbrook fairer and more equitable. She advocates for peace, happiness, and a retreat from the industrial world."
FAR_tribal:0 "First Principle: Harmony With The Land"
FAR_tribal_desc:0 "Moonblossom recognises that much of the evil in the world comes from our inability to live in a correct relationship with nature. To this end, we must abolish the false distinctions we make between ourselves and the creatures of the earth - such things as stone buildings, plows, and industrial machines must all go!"
FAR_peace:0 "Second Principle: Harmony With The World"
FAR_peace_desc:0 "The second principle of Moonblossom's Manifesto is that of peace between the ponies of the world. After all, what is to be gained by war? We would be much better off without weapons and soldiers."
FAR_egalitarianism:0 "Third Principle: Harmony With Each Other"
FAR_egalitarianism_desc:0 "The Final Principle of Moonblossom is the abolition of distinctions between each other. Mother, father, mare, stallion, pony, and griffon - all of these are meaningless. These bonds are really chains, chains that must be broken if we are to be truly free."
FAR_famine:0 "Disastrous Famine"
FAR_famine_desc:0 "Disaster! Moonblossom's forced primitivisation of Farbrook has left it with more ponies than its new lack of infrastructure can support. There is not enough food to feed everyone, and something must be done before thousands starve to death!"
FAR_collapse:0 "Social Collapse"
FAR_collapse_desc:0 "The first thing that the furious ponies of Farbrook did was to ask Moonblossom to help them. She only responded by saying that this was an unfortunate but necessary step in the perfecting of the Communist society. Needless to say, they weren't happy with that..."
FAR_NCH_absorb:0 "Beg Glenclyf"
FAR_NCH_absorb_desc:0 "We are out of food, out of leaders, and out of options. We do not have the strength to rebuild ourselves, not in time to prevent thousands of deaths. We must beg our ancient friends, the Changelings of Glenclyf for help. We will ask them to rule us instead - at least they have food."
FAR_RIV_absorb:0 "Beg The Riverfolk"
FAR_RIV_absorb_desc:0 "We never thought it would come to this, but we have no options left. The River Federation has food - let us ask them for help, in exchange for our sovereignty. We obviously aren't capable of ruling ourselves..."

### EVENTS #################################
###########################################
FAR.1.t:0 "The Council's Decision"
FAR.1.d:0 "After months of deliberation, the Council has finally made up their mind who should lead the Farbrook tribes in this difficult time. Their choice was..."
FAR.1.a:0 "We need stable leadership - no changes"
FAR.1.b:0 "A firm hoof is necessary - Cenhelm must go"
FAR.2.t:0 "Power Struggles within the Council"
FAR.2.d:0 "The Council has rejected the experienced leadership of Cenhelm - but who will they choose to replace him?"
FAR.2.a:0 "The Communists have some interesting ideas - let's invite them into the Council"
FAR.2.b:0 "Chief Gering shows promise - he will lead us through this difficult time"
FAR.3.t:0 "A Proposal From The East"
FAR.3.d:0 "An pony envoy sought an audience with the Regent today, and offered a most interesting proposal. She claimed to come from the far east, from a backwards nation called Farbrook. We recognised the name as one of the clans of savages that the Knightly Orders have been charged with guarding our Eastern border from for centuries now. The envoy claimed that Farbrook regrets their history of animosity with us, and claims her leader, Hermane Gering, asks for help. Gering wishes to unite the Ponies of the Eastern Hills and plains, but the River Federation is posing a major obstacle to this, and he asks for our aid in defeating them. In exchange, Gering offers his obedience to the crown, offering the Eastern lands to us if we will but allow him to administrate them."
FAR.3.a:0 "Offer him aid and command the Knightly Orders to fight alongside him. We have much to gain and little to lose"
FAR.3.b:0 "We are not interested in the affairs of savages"
FAR.4.t:0 "Divide and Conquer"
FAR.4.d:0 "A messenger came from the frigid North today. He claimed to speak on behalf of Hermane Gering, Chieftain of the hillponies of Farbrook. Chieftain Gering is offering us a simple deal: agree to go to war with the Federation alongside Gering, and we will be granted a large chunk of the spoils, gaining access to the rich floodplains and farmlands of the River Valleys. What will our response be?"
FAR.4.a:0 "The lands are fertile...tell him we accept"
FAR.4.b:0 "This isn't in our best interest"
FAR.5.t:0 "Divide and Conquer"
FAR.5.d:0 "A messenger came from the frigid North today. He claimed to speak on behalf of Hermane Gering, Chieftain of the hillponies of Farbrook. Chieftain Gering is offering us a simple deal: agree to go to war with the Federation alongside Gering, and we will be granted a large chunk of the spoils, gaining access to the rich floodplains and farmlands of the River Valleys. What will our response be?"
FAR.5.a:0 "The lands are fertile...tell him we accept"
FAR.5.b:0 "This isn't in our best interest"
FAR.6.t:0 "The Empire is Interested"
FAR.6.d:0 "Our messenger arrived from Griffonheim yesterday, with excellent news - the Empire has accepted our offer. Military advisors, weapons, and personnel will be delivered to us for the war effort, and while the Empire is not willing to commit itself personally to a war in the East, it has ordered the two Griffin Knightly Orders to provide us with direct military assistance in any future wars. Of course, they DO expect our pledge of alleigance in exchange..."
FAR.6.a:0 "Of course, of course, whatever they want"
FAR.7.t:0 "Imperial Scorn"
FAR.7.d:0 "Ill news has returned to us this day: the Empire is not interested in helping us against the Federation. They are unwilling to commit themselves to a war in the East without better hope of a profit for themselves."
FAR.7.a:0 "We will have to look elsewhere"
FAR.8.t:0 "The Gryphian Host signs the River Pact"
FAR.8.d:0 "Excellent news! The Gryphian Host has agreed to our terms, and will attack the Federation alongside us. However, they will demand part of the Federation's land in exchange for this."
FAR.8.a:0 "I can already hear Lake City burning!"
FAR.9.t:0 "The Gryphian Host isn't interested"
FAR.9.d:0 "Sad news came from the South today - the Gryphian Host refused to join our offensive pact to partition the River Federation."
FAR.9.a:0 "Never trust a Griffon!"
FAR.10.t:0 "The Zebras sign the River Pact"
FAR.10.d:0 "An envoy arrived this morning, bring word from the Zebra nation that they have accepted our deal. In return for land, they will help us to defeat the River Ponies."
FAR.10.a:0 "They may look odd, but they will be useful nonetheless"
FAR.11.t:0 "The Zebras turn their noses down at us"
FAR.11.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Zebras have sent a messenger telling us that they have no interest in our pact to partition the River Federation."
FAR.11.a:0 "We should've known they were cowards"
FAR.13.t:0 "The Deer sign the River Pact"
FAR.13.d:0 "We received word from the South today that the Deer are willing and eager to support us in our war with the River Federation."
FAR.13.a:0 "The Federation's days are numbered!"
FAR.14.t:0 "The Deer ignore our proposal"
FAR.14.d:0 "Bad news arrived today - the Deer are not interested in joining with us against the River Ponies."
FAR.14.a:0 "Damn their eyes"
FAR.15.t:0 "Military Mission From Farbrook"
FAR.15.d:0 "In view of our new alliance with Hermane Gering, Farbrook has sent some of its finest military minds on a mission to our nation. This should significantly improve the quality of our officer corps."
FAR.15.a:0 "Maybe those northerners aren't so bad after all"
FAR.16.a:0 "The Coldmouth Corridor"
FAR.16.t:0 "Farbrook Demands Coldmouth Corridor"
FAR.16.d:0 "Hermane Gering's rhetoric has been getting more and more inflammatory as of late. He has been speaking for months about how the land from Coldmouth to the sea is, and always has been, hill pony land, and that all hill ponies should be in one nation. Now, an ultimatum has been delivered to us - cede this territory to Farbrook's regime or face open war."
FAR.16.a:0 "We have no choice. Surrender the land"
FAR.16.b:0 "Over my dead body!"
FAR.17.t:0 "Firtree Folds"
FAR.17.d:0 "Intimidated by our great might, Firtree has willingly ceded the Coldmouth Corridor."
FAR.17.a:0 "As it should be"
FAR.18.t:0 "Firtree Defiant"
FAR.18.d:0 "Foolishly, the ponies of Firtree have refused our generous offer to unite all hillponies under one nation."
FAR.18.a:0 "Do they think the Federation will protect them? Hah!"
FAR.19.t:0 "Famine Strikes!"
FAR.19.d:0 "Unfortunately, Moonblossom's policies of forced technological regression have had entirely predictable effects. Our food production is no longer able to keep up with our population, and food is rapidly running out. Babes are wailing in hunger, mothers have nothing to give them. Riots are breaking out all over the country, and all eyes turn to Moonblossom's tent, seeking a way out of this disaster."
FAR.19.a:0 "If only we had known!"
FAR.20.t:0 "Farbrook Begs For Food"
FAR.20.d:0 "A desperate envoy arrived this morning, famished and gaunt, like a skeleton. He told us that Farbrook's leader, Moonblossom, had enacted policies of agrarianism and primtivism that had resulted in a terrible famine that will surely kill thousands of ponies if nothing is done about it. Farbrook begs us to come in and take care of them - all government has collapsed entirely, rioting is commonplace, and the strongest steal and hoard what food remains for themselves. The situation is extremely dire, and only a complete takeover is likely to prove effective at this point."
FAR.20.a:0 "This is a humanitarian disaster! Taking over their land would be, not imperialism, but mercy"
FAR.20.b:0 "Sorry, but we simply cannot afford to take on this much responsibility"
FAR.21.t:0 "Upon Deaf Ears"
FAR.21.d:0 "Our offer has been rejected. [From.Owner.GetNamea] is not interested in taking care of us, and we can expect no help from them."
FAR.21.a:0 "Can we ever catch a break?"
