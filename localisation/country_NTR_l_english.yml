NTR_finishing_the_queens_labors_desc:0 " Despite Fiana I's efforts to modernize, the North has no industry to speak of beyond workshops, its schools consist of volunteering tribal elders and its roads are mostly forest and mountain paths. It's time to get to work and finish what she started."

NTR_use_all_we_have_desc:0 "While some would say we should embrace free trade, we know that our resources must be first and foremost used to develop our homeland first and foremost. The time for unrestricted trade can come when we have the industrial base to be more than a place for raw materials."

NTR_connecting_to_the_outside_world_desc:0 "For too long the Tribes have remained locked away from the rest of the world.

The world is going to come to us whether we like it or not, so we must become a part of it so that we are not blind."

NTR_protect_our_workers:0 "Protect our Workers"
NTR_protect_our_workers_desc:0 "As our society transforms we cannot forget those who stand in our factories, day in and day out, making this transformation possible.

NTR_the_northern_manufactories:0 "The Northern Manufactories"
NTR_the_northern_manufactories_desc:0 "As we begin our efforts to industrialize the north, the first step is to gather our best and brightest craftsponies together. Merely these proposed manufactories will double our industrial capacity and show our people our commitment to strengthening the north, providing well paying jobs for our best and most able and improving our industrial capacity, such as it is."
NTR_the_new_economy:0 "The New Economy"
NTR_the_new_economy_desc:0 "So many things about the way that the southerners' economy works is mysterious and even bizarre to the Northern Tribes. Merely the idea of a centralized currency is strange to many, not to mention something like a national bank. Still, these ideas are going to have to be taught the people one way or another."

NTR_scase:0 "Standardized College and Science Education"
NTR_scase_desc:0 "As time goes on, we are opening more and more schools around the North, and not only primary such.

NTR_new_foundries_and_steelworks_desc:0 "We aren't going to just ship out the iron and coal in the mountains to be smelted into steel elsewhere. An ambitious plan has been put forward that will let us take it from ore to steel, all in the same place. The potential is obvious, and the answer to whether we should equally so."
NTR_efficient_mining:0 "Efficient Mining"
NTR_efficient_mining_desc:0 "We have never been a people to waste what we have, and there's no reason why we should think any differently about these new mines. Merging the many small mining companies and groups into one will let us organize and make the most out of our resources."

Our people's potential and ambition is doing the work at last, letting us leap yet further into the future."
NTR_the_common_examination:0 "The Common Examination"
NTR_the_common_examination_desc:0 "The education of our people is progressing splendidly. We have managed to get nearly every child in the north to some kind of primary school, with many going on to secondary and even higher education as well. The system is still haphazard though, and we will implement a universal examination system that every child in the North will have a fair chance to reach higher in their studies."
NTR_from_towns_to_cities:0 "From Towns to Cities"
NTR_from_towns_to_cities_desc:0 "Until now, the towns of the north have usually been small clusters of houses, with little in the way of planning or amenities, but with the rapid changes in our society it is obvious that this won't be enough any more. Ponies are moving into the cities in droves, and unless we want to end up with giant slums, we will need to be proactive. It is time to urbanize the North."
NTR_northern_universities:0 "Northern Universities"
NTR_northern_universities_desc:0 "The North is no longer a backwater, bur rather it is a place of learning and development, much like any of the great nations in the world.

NTR_electronic_eyes_at_the_sky_desc:0 "Watching the skies for enemies have been an important duty for our warriors for centuries, and yet even this is changing in these new days.

NTR_a_new_north:0 "A New North"
NTR_a_new_north_desc:0 "Our efforts in the factories and on the roads as well as in the field has shown how interconnected the new world is.

NTR_defensive_strongpoints:0 "Defensive Strongpoints"
NTR_defensive_strongpoints_desc:0 "The best defense is the one that stops the enemy in his tracks. We should fortify the borders and build up bases for our airforce so that we can give the enemy the fight of their life the instant they cross the border.

We have already found several promising scientists across Griffonia who haven't been given a fair chance to demonstrate their theories. We will sweep them up and give them a fair chance.

This system, while strengthening the communal bonds, does little to provide the type of education needed if the North is to advance.\n\nWith the help from foreign experts and academics, we are now facing the question of how to implement this new system of universal education.

Already the Tribal Council had been replaced with a new, grandiose hall fit for a king, and more was to come. Looking the other way, she could see the smokestacks from the factories down by the coastline, even the line of workers on their way to their shifts.\n\nIt was not much, and most of Everfrost was as it always had been, but she could tell that a new age was here.

As the North industrializes, they have become highways unlike anything anyone could have imagined scant years ago. Hundreds, indeed thousands of logs float slowly downstream, bound together in giant, raft-like formations. Pegasi and griffons fly overhead as they watch the logs, taking turns to slowly circle for hours above and dive down, time and time again, to push them away from the banks.\n\nThe sharp sound of a whistle summons their attention to further ahead, where logs have begun jamming, and a group of more experienced griffons dive down, one of them swearing as he digs in his bag, taking out several sticks of dynamite. With only seconds to spare as more logs come up, he lights the fuse and buries the stick inside the logjam, taking to the sky before the dynamite explodes, tearing apart several logs and clearing the jam, letting the countless logs continue their journey downstream."

Mills line the eastern banks of the river now, over a dozen of them, and the once little town now houses thousands upon thousands of workers.\n\nAs the flow of logs come slowly meandering down the river it is broken up and fed at a steady pace up to the banks where they are caught and dragged up towards the waiting sawblades. The sawblades' sharp shrieks, the creaking of cranes and pulleys, the hissing of steam engines and the yelling of workers fill the air throughout the days, and yet the dissonant sounds are like a siren song for the hundreds and thousands that come from across Cubtria to work, whether to send money back home or to build a life in the rapidly expanding city.\n\nAs the logs turn to lumber they are loaded onto the cargo trains that await to carry it all first across the newly built bridge over the river and then towards Everfrost."

There, other ponies and griffons waited to hook the blocks onto cranes to be lifted off the band to further away, where the empty vehicles stood waiting for their owners."

Then we start working the manufactories, then all of a sudden the logging industry takes off and then we only do that a couple of years before we're here putting cars together... are they done yet?"\n\n"What, you don't like progress?" his friend and colleague said, sipping his brew. "I did some counting yesterday, the kid's been doing great in counting classes... it's maths, right? Right, well we counted out that back in the old tribe, it'd have taken a rough year to earn what we're earning in a week here... heck did we even use money that much?"\n\n"Yes yes, that's all good," the first worker rolled his eyes. "But I'm just getting the hang of this thing, I'd like for that at least to be settled before we go on to shovel sun, or bake crystals or whatever comes next. Change is fine and all... now there's a statement I wouldn't have ever said as a kid, elder would have tanned my hide... but I'm done with it now. No more upheaval, can we just be done now for a while?"\n\n"Let's say that," the other worker agreed. "We've reached the end now. There's no more steps to take, society doesn't get better than this. We'll have to do with what we have."\n\n"Can we ask for no more wars as well?" the first asked.\n\n"Let's not get greedy" his friend commented before they both finished their brews to go back inside to finish their shift."

And then the explosion had hit, killing several, including her mother.\n\nOutside the door, the council members and chieftains were arguing across the palace; she could hear them even in here. Angry accusations, even threats, were flying everywhere, and the tribes that still were loyal were starting to fracture. What was she meant to do? She did not have her mother's strength. She was barely more than a filly to many of the ponies out there.\n\nStill... she knew the bitter fact of the matter was that right now, the north did not have anyone else. If she didn't do anything, who would?"

Ntribes.501.d:0 "As the doors to the throne room slammed shut, Fiana sank slowly down in her throne, exhaling deeply. They chieftains were angry. Of course they were angry. As one of them had said: "your mother is barely dead in the ground and you are already tearing the North apart!".\n\nShe wondered what they were imagining would have happened. Should all remain the same, with their positions secure and their traditions unspoilt, even as the North was crumbling in this new age? She had placated them as best as she could, but she could tell from the look she gave her that this wasn't over yet, not by a long shot."

You are not fit to lead the North, and your path will be the death of us as a people. We are not going to rise in mutiny, but we will not support your mad notions. Until you see the error of your ways, we are not going to bow to you in any way, nor do we have anything to discuss with you." With that, the old stallion turned around and left Fiana sitting on the throne and the entire throne room staring after him. A guard came up next to Fiana, looking to her as he clenched his spear, but Fiana shook her head and motioned for the stallion to be allowed to leave.\n\nNearly a third of the tribes has already declared their intent to not follow her lead, and Fiana knew that if she struck him down, that would only further exacerbate the situation. It was too late, and she didn't have the army to violently enforce control. Yet, nor did she have the money, or the loyalty of the people, leaving her to ponder what precisely she did have."

Rather, ponies were beginning to abandon the castle out of fear that they would become targets.\n\nFiana was happy that no one had been hurt, but the more ponies began to leave, the more it felt like everything was just slipping out of her hooves. Not even the people who worked for her had any faith left in her, and every new servant that left tore up another hole in what little legitimacy she still had.\n\n"Tell the servants that whoever stays gets a raise... fifty percent more pay." she told the chancellor.\n\n"Your highness, we don't have the money for that," he replied quietly.\n\n"I know, but either we lose legitimacy or we lose money. We'll have to find the money somehow," she sighed.\n\nOne thing after another..."

Couldn't they at least have been weakened as well after the explosion? Instead, they seemed to have only been empowered, with reports coming in daily about how they were acting with impunity, openly defying the tribal councils and her both.\n\nEnemies in the palace and enemies in the mountains... what had she gotten herself into?"

Standing in front of it, Fiana II felt the memories come back to her: the chaos after her mother's death, the funeral where she had been in too much shock to do much other than stare, the chaotic fight against the communists and the realization of just how deeply their influence had pierced.\n\n"Hello mom..." Fiana spoke quietly. "I'm sorry I haven't visited you until now." Slowly, the princess sat down next to the gravestone, looking up at the sky. "I don't know how I managed to get through all this, but somehow I did... The communists are probably done for, at least outside of Skynavia, and the tribal councils are starting to come around to me... Somehow..." Weakly, the recently crowned queen chuckled.\n\n"Now they all think I am some great queen meant for songs and legends, not just a terrified mare who grasped at straws and managed to pull victory out of thin air... Or maybe I'm too hard on myself, I just don't know. I..." coming to a halt, Fiana suddenly sniffed, tears beginning to slowly trickle down her face. "I miss you mommy..." she sobbed, "I miss you so much... why did I succeed where you failed? Why did you have to die...?" Her voice trailed off into despondent weeping, and for almost an hour, the princess of the Northern Tribes cried - for the first time - over her mother's death.\n\nAs she slowly recovered, wiped the tears out of her eyes and looked to her mother's name again. "I won't let this chance go to waste mom, I swear. I've united our peoples, and I'll give them a better future. Just... I wish you could be here to see it." Rising up, Fiana brushed some of the snow off the gravestone, trailing her hoof over her mother's name. "I love you mom..." she whispered before turning to depart, wiping her eyes as she walked back to her escort. She was going to be a Queen now, after all, and a Queen couldn't be seen crying openly."

She had put two lanterns in her window to signal that they should wait and see if he would meet with his co-conspirators, and now all she could do was to wait.\n\nIt was unbelievable.

A silent nod from the guard captain, a signal, then two large stallions bucked the doors down and the agents stormed inside, weapons raised. The chaos was brief, but intense. A couple of griffons took to the air and tried to escape out the windows only to get shot down, a pony threw himself after a weapon only to be pierced by several spears. After a few seconds, the chaos abated as the traitors were rounded up and clasped in fetters.\n\n"How dare you?!" one of the captives, old general Watershed yelled as he struggled against the restraints. "Her highness will hear about this, you will..."\n\n"I already know," Fiana said, dropping her cloak as she stepped forth between two agents, staring the old general down.\n\n"Y-your highness..." the general began, Fiana cutting him off.\n\n"Save it for the trial, traitor.

I have decreed that any communist who wishes to lay down their weapons will receive full amnesty, and already hundreds of warriors have taken the offer. I have called you all here to ask that you reaffirm your vows to the throne.\n\nThe communist threat is dealt with for now, but it will return again and it will do so precisely because we stand divided. I do not want the North to fall to these southern invaders, nor do you, and I no longer sit so unsteadily on this throne that I will crumble from a few dissident tribes.\n\nAll of you... I know you may have your reservations about what I do, but I ask that you look to my accomplishments, and place your faith in me. Not for my sake, but for the sake of our people, our history and our very way of life. I will defend those things, no matter what I must do.

Ntribes.575.d:0 "Fiana was silent as she came into the cell, flanked by two armed guards.

She stared him down, waiting to see if he would say anything. He didn't, and in the end she was the one who broke the silence.\n\n"Why?" she asked him. "You were on the emergency council, my mother trusted you. Our people trusted you. Why?!" she found herself screaming.\n\n"Because you think you're helping your people, but you're only helping yourself" he replied. "These people lived for centuries without a king, yet when the socialists came, your mother used their fear of the new to claim power for herself, like any other tyrant. Do you think that your mother was motivated by some noble ideals? She saw a power vacuum and she, along with the other merchants and trinket-peddlers, waltzed past the Tribes' old ways to grab power for themselves even when these people had a chance of gaining true freedom."\n\n"Freedom by being conquered, have their traditions and culture annihilated and be made to serve their new masters' agenda?" Fiana asked. "That sounds like slavery."\n\n"The socialists serve the common worker, your mother only served her own interests." Watershed told her, "We don't choose fancy dresses as the people suffer-"\n\n"You mean the suffering you ushered in?" Fiana cut him off, Watershed only shaking his head.\n\n"Your mother," he sighed, "for all her faults, at least understood her role in this. She delighted in it, but she understood. You... I pity you. You never had a chance from the beginning, and now you've been indoctrinated with all these fairy tales of being a princess that you'll think you're helping your people while you're pushing them down..." Fiana could only stare at him. Even here, as he was captured and about to be punished for treason, he looked at her with only pity and contempt.

I will die either way, and my death will prove me right in the end, as you become a tyrant all the same." He spoke calmly, his every action showing how he already had made peace with death.\n\n"What is your decision, your highness?" the representative from the tribal council asked, watching her intently, like everyone else did. Fiana steeled herself. She already had made up her mind, but now, as seemingly the entire North watched her, she had to speak out.\n\n"Adam Watershed," she began, "For your crimes against the tribes, and your treason, I sentence you to..."

She could see their faces even from up here, see their anger and their resentment. They were calling for her to step down, and even now more ponies and griffons were joining in.\n\nHow could it all have gone so wrong? All this death, all this struggling... all for naught, and her people were turning against her. The monarchy established to help the North was now resented by it, her mother had died in vain and Fiana, for all her struggling, had only reaped failure. Behind her the guard captain came up, clearing his throat to get her attention.\n\n"The last group of tribes has officially declared against you, your highness," he said. "I am sorry, but there is not much left I can do you for. Forgive my failure..." he bowed his head deeply, Fiana unable to answer him."

The Tribal Council and Fiana were both seized, and any opposition was too scattered to do anything. When dawn came, a red banner flew over Everfrost.\n\nAdam Watershed watched the dawn from inside the palace, feeling the relief that it had all gone so well. Turning around, he looked to Fiana, who sat silently in her seat further away, flanked by two guards.\n\n"You know I pity you," he told her. "You are an incredibly capable filly who'd be a credit to any cause you'd serve. But after your mother's death..." he sighed, "I guess no one can blame you for being so determined to avenge her, but what a waste..." Fiana said nothing and instead only glared daggers at him. \n\n"We aren't going to kill you Fiana, the North has seen enough bloodshed and I am not going to have your blood on my claws. One of the Moonrise Tribes is still clinging to their old beliefs, and we're leaving them alone as long as they don't challenge us. They've agreed to take you in, and you can take your time there. In time, I hope that you'll see the truth. You can still serve your people, only in a different way. For the first time you'll have a choice, and I hope you will take it."\n\nAfter Fiana had been led out, one of the griffons leaned in to him.

With tears in her eyes, she begun to say something but stopped before shaking her head again. She could only stammer out a few words before stopping, reduced to a wreck by the events of the last weeks.\n\nIn the background, a servant slipped away, taking the side door out of Everfrost castle and making her way to the outskirts of the city, where a group of old ponies were waiting, watching Everfrost in silence."

After the initial catastrophe all those years ago and the siren song sung by the little girl's mother to lure in so many of their kinsponies, the old ways were finally resurgent. They were no longer divided between those who respected the old ways and those who let mad flights of fancy take the place of wisdom. Fiana was locked up in her room and would be sent away to whichever tribe would claim responsibility for her. Now, the true children of the North would take on their hated foes.
