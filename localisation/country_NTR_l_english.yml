### Industrial and research branch ###

NTR_the_beginning_of_a_long_journey:0 "The First Steps Forward"
NTR_the_beginning_of_a_long_journey_desc:0 "The North has no industry to speak of beyond workshops, its schools consist of volunteering tribal elders and its roads are mostly forest and mountain paths. It's time to get to work and remake our tribal homeland to a new, greater heights."
NTR_factories_for_people:0 "The First Factories in the North"
NTR_factories_for_people_desc:0 "With support from the merchant guilds, we will be able to embark on a great building project that will double our industrial capacity and show our people our commitment to strengthening the north. These factories will supply modern, well-paying jobs to our people and let us build up the North faster than ever before."
NTR_unite_the_regions:0 "Bind the North Together"
NTR_unite_the_regions_desc:0 "The pathways through the mountains and forests that bind our tribes together are a decent foundation. Calling upon all tribes, we will begin a project to expand and improve these paths, turning as many of them as possible into roads."

NTR_foreign_investors:0 "Opening our Doors"
NTR_foreign_investors_desc:0 "We cannot build our nation ourselves. In this age international trade is more important than ever, and we must open our doors to the outside world. If foreigners wish to come here and through their affairs help build up our nation, then so be it."
NTR_prototypes:0 "Prototype Electronics"
NTR_prototypes_desc:0 "These new devices - these electronics - seem like magic, but we are told that they are purely technological creations. We can only dream of the possibilities; instant communication across all of the North, machines that can count on their own, and even devices that could watch the sky on their own... are we sure they are not magical?"
NTR_foreign_teachers:0 "New Teachers for a New Era"
NTR_foreign_teachers_desc:0 "The old system of tribal elders passing down their knowledge to our children has served us well for a long time, but no longer. We need to invite foreign experts and teachers to help teach our children new knowledge for a new era."
NTR_blueprint:0 "Advanced Tools"
NTR_blueprint_desc:0 "The rate of progress in the world is unequalled, and every year there is some new development. As we build up our homeland we cannot just keep pace with them, we must develop even faster than other nations if we are to catch up."

NTR_bridges_and_tunnels:0 "Bridges and Tunnels"
NTR_bridges_and_tunnels_desc:0 "The rolling hills and wide rivers of the North make for challenging barriers for our nascent road network. Thankfully, the guilds have managed to contacts several southern architects specializing in navigating these kinds of obstacles."
NTR_new_factories:0 "New Factories"
NTR_new_factories_desc:0 "Every day, the potential of the North is being fulfilled as more and more factories open. In region where once single factories stood like lone, out of place visitors to our harsh homeland we now see great industrial complexes slowly bloom."
NTR_close_the_door:0 "Use All we Have"
NTR_close_the_door_desc:0 "While some would say we should embrace free trade, we know that our resources must be first and foremost used to develop our homeland first and foremost. The time for unrestricted trade can come when we have the industrial base to be more than a place for raw materials."
NTR_labor_regulations:0 "Protect our Workers"
NTR_labor_regulations_desc:0 "As our society transforms we cannot forget those who stand in our factories, day in and day out, making this transformation possible. It is grueling work and we would betray them if we left them to struggle there like modern-day thralls. We will make sure they will be shielded from abuse."

NTR_new_era:0 "Industrialization is Coming North"
NTR_new_era_desc:0 "Much has been done but even more remains to be done. We have only just begun to catch up to the rest of Griffonia, and now we can start to actually harness the potential of the North. With foreign help, we will launch our nation towards the modern era."

NTR_higher_minds:0 "The Everfrost College"
NTR_higher_minds_desc:0 "With our people becoming more and more educated, it is time to open the first institute for higher learning in the history of the north. While only a college right now, there is hardly a Northerner who isn't eagerly waiting for this place to grow into a university equal to those found in the south."
NTR_doctrine_of_education:0 "Universal Education"
NTR_doctrine_of_education_desc:0 "If we are to rise up as a real nation, then we must view learning as not a privilege, but a right for every last pony and griffon in the nation. Untold potential lies within our people, and we will give every last Northerner the tools needed to better express this."
NTR_the_first_discovery:0 "Electronic Eyes at the Sky"
NTR_the_first_discovery_desc:0 "Watching the skies for enemies have been an important duty for our warriors for centuries, and yet even this is changing in these new days. This new invention, which apparently uses the same kind of tecnology as a radio does, will let us spot enemies far away, long before they can attack us."
NTR_CRSI:0 "Standardized College and Science Education"
NTR_CRSI_desc:0 "As time goes on, we are opening more and more scools around the North, and not only primary such. Focusing on higher levels of education as well will make higher forms of scientific knowledge less of a rarity. When training scientists, it is good if they know some science to start with after all."
NTR_new_methods_of_protection:0 "Electronic riddling"
NTR_new_methods_of_protection_desc:0 "Riddles are an old and time-honored tradition in the north, used in both war and peace. To our delight, these new electronic machines will allow us to make use of war-riddles - the ciphers used to hide the actual meaning of messages - on a level undreamed of before."

NTR_geological_intelligence:0 "Prospecting the North"
NTR_geological_intelligence_desc:0 "With a nation that is bound together and empowered like never before, we can finally begin looking into all the stories of great caverns filled with crystals or giant veins of iron across the mountainsides. We will send out hundreds of prospectors to investigate and map out all the wealth our homeland holds."
NTR_mountain_roads:0 "Mountain Roads"
NTR_mountain_roads_desc:0 "With sufficient dynamite and determination, even the most stubborn of mountains must yield, and if we are to make good use of our homeland's resources, we must force these mighty old titans into submission."
NTR_steelworks:0 "New Foundries and Steelworks"
NTR_steelworks_desc:0 "We aren't going to just ship out the iron and coal in the mountains to be smelted into steel elsewhere. An ambitious plan has been put forward that will let us take it from ore to steel, all in the same place. The potential is obvious, and the answer to whether we should equally so."
NTR_mining_concern:0 "Efficient Mining"
NTR_mining_concern_desc:0 "We have never been a people to waste what we have, and there's no reason why we should think any differently about these new mines. Merging the many small mining companies and groups into one will let us organize and make the most out of our resources."
NTR_construction_efforts:0 "New Construction Methods"
NTR_construction_efforts_desc:0 ""Building a house is easy. Building a house well is hard" as they say. When you must build a thousand houses well it only gets more difficult. We should make sure to develop our architectural and industrial knowledge so that we still can build as well as we ever have, even when the buildings are more numerous and bigger than ever."

NTR_unitary_country:0 "A New North"
NTR_unitary_country_desc:0 "After so much planning and so much effort, the result is starting to show itself. For the first time in ever, it finally makes sense to talk about the North as one single entity rather than a catchall term for the many small tribes and groups. So much has been achieved, and we are better off than ever before."
NTR_public_education:0 "The Common Examination"
NTR_public_education_desc:0 "The education of our people is progressing splendidy. We have managed to get nearly every child in the north to some kind of primary school, with many going on to secondary and even higher education as well. The system is still haphazard though, and we will implement a universal examination system that every child in the North will have a fair chance to reach higher in their studies."
NTR_new_lifestyle:0 "From Towns to Cities"
NTR_new_lifestyle_desc:0 "Until now, the towns of the north have usually been small clusters of houses, with little in the way of planning or amenities, but with the rapid changes in our society it is obvious that this won't be enough any more. Ponies are moving into the cities in droves, and unless we want to end up with giant slums, we will need to be proactive. It is time to urbanize the North."
NTR_blood_of_war:0 "The Blood of War"
NTR_blood_of_war_desc:0 "Thinking about all the times little fillies have heard stories about strange black waters in distant valleys or caves is enough to give you a headache when you realize that if half of those are true, we are sitting on oil reserves enough to fuel the nation ten times over."
NTR_war_forges:0 "War Forges for a New Age"
NTR_war_forges_desc:0 "We aren't hungry for war and never have been. Yet, as the last decades have shown we cannot count on our old isolation to shield us any more. We must make sure that if war comes it will come to a well armed and armored North that is not only willing but also able to fight back."

NTR_economic_miracle:0 "Economic Miracle"
NTR_economic_miracle_desc:0 "The road has been long, but the fruits of our labour is undeniable. The economy of the North now is starting to move on its own. We are now in a position where we will direct it, and not drag it with all out strength forwards. Our people's potential and ambition is doing the work at last, letting us leap yet further into the future."

NTR_expanses_of_the_north:0 "Expanses of the North"
NTR_expanses_of_the_north_desc:0 "As our towns and industries grow, one thing that we are not strapped for is space. Indeed, it seems like there's always some place to expand into, no matter how many we become. Formerly isolated valleys and forests are now opened to the world and gives more space for our people to use."
NTR_investment_in_the_fleet:0 "Naval Investments"
NTR_investment_in_the_fleet_desc:0 "Traditionally, every coastal village could build its own boats, meaning there was always some experienced boat-builders at hand, no matter where you were. While we cannot open shipyards in every village, we can make sure that both the east and west possesses modern shipbuilding facilities."
NTR_northern_frontier:0 "The Northern Frontier"
NTR_northern_frontier_desc:0 "Everfrost and Frostbell are the two gems of the northern coast, and any enemy that will seek to do us harm will strike at these two places. We aren't going to be caught off guard, but instead will fortify our cities so that even as our enemies reach that far noth, they will be defied to the last breath."

NTR_newfound_homeland:0 "Warriors of a Modern Era."
NTR_newfound_homeland_desc:0 "After all these centuries, our people are united as one. We think of ourselves not as tribesponies or city griffons, but as citizens of the North. We have built this homeland together, and we will protect it together. We have always been fierce warriors and loyal countrymen and though much has changed, that hasn't."
NTR_reserves_for_the_front:0 "Preparations for a Total Defense"
NTR_reserves_for_the_front_desc:0 "The world is turning more and more violent, and if war comes again, we must be ready. Building up secret arsenals in the wilderness will allow us to keep up the fight even if the larger industrial centers would have fallen."
NTR_army_support:0 "Defensive Strongpoints"
NTR_army_support_desc:0 "The best defense is the one that stops the enemy in his tracks. We should fortify the borders and build up bases for our airforce so that we can give the enemy the fight of their life the instant they cross the border. Not only will this give us time to mobilize, but we can also bleed our enemies  as much as possible from the get-go."

NTR_towards_utopia:0 "The Modern Tribe"
NTR_towards_utopia_desc:0 "The weather of our homeland may be harsh, but inside our homes it is warm. Our cities are well-connected and though our society has changed massively, we take as good care of each other as we did in the olden days. Maybe we are a tribe of hundreds of thousands instead of hundreds, but we are stil one family, and in a family you are there for each other."
NTR_the_forefront_of_science:0 "The Scientific Frontier"
NTR_the_forefront_of_science_desc:0 "We have always been on the frontier, claiming a home in the unexplored wilds, and why should we not be so in science as well? We have already found several promising scientists across griffonia who haven't been given a fair chance to demonstrate their theories. We will sweep them up and give them a fair chance. If only a third of them are onto something then we will be a scientific superpower before long."
NTR_bright_future:0 "The Future Looks Bright"
NTR_bright_future_desc:0 "We have achieved what many thought impossible. We have taken scattered tribes and towns and bound them together into one greater whole, one that now can enjoy the fruits of modern life. Short life spans, child mortality, malnourishment and poverty are slowly becoming things of the past, and we are soon going to be equal to any southerner kingdom."
NTR_over_the_horizon:0 "Over the Horizon"
NTR_over_the_horizon_desc:0 "History never quite ends. There is always a new challenge over the horizon, and there will always be something that needs to be addressed. It will be addressed, however, by a strong and unified north that works together for the betterment of all."

### Military branch (Harmony & Communism) ###

NTR_clear_hierarchy:0 "Establish a Hierarchy"
NTR_clear_hierarchy_desc:0 "The Northern Tribes doesn't have a military, it has a hundred militaries. Local tribal militias, small independent bands and personal guards all can be found here, and there is virtually no unified command structure. Before anything else happens, we must form this structure and convince the people of the need for a modern military force."
NTR_reform_ground_forces:0 "A True Army"
NTR_reform_ground_forces_desc:0 "Bands of between twenty and one hundred warriors worked in the olden times, but now we must create an actual structured military. To this end, we are convening a grand council of warriors, where all tribes may present their martial wisdom so that we may tap into all the potential our people have"
NTR_rifles:0 "New Rifles"
NTR_rifles_desc:0 "This modern era has weapons that we could only have dreamt of in the past. A single warrior can now easily slay ten, even twenty men, as long as he has a good rifle with plenty of bullets. Imagine what a thousand, or ten thousand ponies with such weapons can do?"
NTR_big_guns:0 "Guns to Shake the Earth"
NTR_big_guns_desc:0 "These new guns are unequalled in destructive capacity, and if we are to be a serious force in the world we must master the cannon as well as the rifle. While some of our traditional warriors call it cowardice, we must accept the idea that courage that leaves you strewn over the landscape is not bravery, but foolishness."
NTR_deadly_magic:0 "Formalized Magical Training"
NTR_deadly_magic_desc:0 "There's plenty of magical skill in the north, and we must now tap into this skill. Even in these modern times, the unicorn's horn is still one of the greatest weapons available as well as one of the few areas where we do not lag behind the rest of the world."
NTR_land_doctrine:0 "Modern Military Thinking"
NTR_land_doctrine_desc:0 ""After the 50th battle of Ostfloy they will be broken" is a tired joke at this point, and one that has cost us many good warriors. We must rethink our tactics as well as our weapons: we do not have the numbers to keep throwing away good warriors." 
NTR_chiefs_of_army:0 "Appointing High Warchiefs"
NTR_chiefs_of_army_desc:0 "The idea of single ponies with authority over all warriors in the north is an alien one, but it is a necessary one. To this end, we will hand-pick our best warriors and leaders to serve the throne directly, even if some of the more prideful chieftains might be annoyed by it."
NTR_support_equipment:0 "The Panoply of War"
NTR_support_equipment_desc:0 "Once, a good sword and a sturdy shield was all that a warrior needed. This is no longer the case, and we must make sure that we can craft the many different tools that our warriors will need to carry out their duty the most effectively."
NTR_SPEC:0 "Modern-day Chosen Warriors"
NTR_SPEC_desc:0 "Even in this era of automatic weapons and heavy guns, there is still a place for the champions and those whose skill surpass all others. Instead of leading the charge, however, they must be silent wolves in the mountains, bloodthirsty sharks in the water and high-flying falcons ready to strike from above."
NTR_colours_of_the_nation:0 "Making the Most of our Potential"
NTR_colours_of_the_nation_desc:0 "The pegasus wings, the earth pony wisdom and the unicorn's magic is what allowed us to survive in these harsh lands, and it will be what allows us to continue to prosper. Technology is no replacement for ability, and we will not become complacent in these new times."
NTR_wild_spirit:0 "Wrath of the North"
NTR_wild_spirit_desc:0 "Our enemies can try their luck against us, but they are unused to the frigid cold of our homeland. We will fight them in the coldest winter and the most terrible blizzards. We will spring out of the snow when they least suspect it and strike with a ferocity unequalled by the soft southerners."

NTR_establish_navy:0 "Founding the Northern Navy"
NTR_establish_navy_desc:0 "In the modern era the seas are as important as ever, even as the ships become bigger and more lethal. The navy, like everything else, will need to be centralized. Longships are easy for single villages to build, cruisers not so much."
NTR_cheap_and_effective:0 "Cheap but Effective"
NTR_cheap_and_effective_desc:0 "These new submarines give us the ability to strike hardand slip away without being detected, all for a relatively modest cost."
NTR_escort_ships:0 "Escort Ships"
NTR_escort_ships_desc:0 "The seas are our lifeline to the south. If war comes, we must be ready to protect our merchants by whatever means necessary. These destroyer ships are just what we need for this duty."
NTR_weak_but_capable:0 "A Small but Lethal Navy"
NTR_weak_but_capable_desc:0 "Instead of banging our heads against our enemies' battleships we should aim to harass and annoy them. Focusing on striking at the enemy's weak points and make him slowly bleed, we can gain the upper hand despite not possessing the kind of giants that the southern powers lionize."
NTR_navy_production_optimisation:0 "Specialized Naval Production"
NTR_navy_production_optimisation_desc:0 "Retooling our shipyards to specialize in the production of smaller ships will give us us the ability to produce them all the faster. While we will hamper the production of larger ships in the future, nobody is expecting us to build giant carriers anyway."
NTR_defenders_of_the_north:0 "Defenders of the North"
NTR_defenders_of_the_north_desc:0 "Our navy must possess the firepower to stand and fight if truly needed, and these light cruisers will be a good first step to project our might across the sea."
NTR_fist_of_the_north:0 "Fists of the Frozen Seas"
NTR_fist_of_the_north_desc:0 "Naval strategy is built strategy, or so they tell us. These heavy cruisers will be the apex of our naval might, possessing the firepower needed to take on nigh anything our enemies may throw at us without overwhelming our ship builders."
NTR_wanderers_of_the_north:0 "Wanderers of the North"
NTR_wanderers_of_the_north_desc:0 "From the Icewaters to the Rocky Sea, our fleets will move swiftly and gracefully. They will strike without warning and retreat before the enemy can rally to fight back, hammering them over and over and let them slowly bleed to death in the frozen waters of the North."

NTR_establish_airforce:0 "A Northern Airforce"
NTR_establish_airforce_desc:0 "We are no strangers to flight, but these new machines offer opportunities beyond what even the strongest Pegasus or Griffon could hope for. Our people look to these inventions with suspicion, but we cannot expect our foes to not use these things, so therefore we must use them as well."
#NTR_airforce_optimisation:0 ""
#NTR_airforce_optimisation_desc:0 ""
#NTR_chief_of_airforce:0 ""
#NTR_chief_of_airforce_desc:0 ""
NTR_hit_quickly:0 "Strike Swiftly"
NTR_hit_quickly_desc:0 "After many discussions, we have decided that the best way to use these new machines is to use them to keep the enemy out of the sky. Fighters can start from smaller airfields and cost less to build anyway."
NTR_our_sky:0 "Support our Warriors"
NTR_our_sky_desc:0 "The North's strength lies in its warriors, and we shouldn't think that our air force would be more than a supplement to them. As our warriors attack they should know that the flyers high above are there to support them."
NTR_we_are_up_guys:0 "Sky-Warriors"
NTR_we_are_up_guys_desc:0 "Our planes should be built with the need to support their brothers in battle down on the ground in mind. Small, swift planes with heavy machine guns can give our warriors good friends in the sky that will tear our enemies apart."
NTR_hit_hard:0 "Strike Hard"
NTR_hit_hard_desc:0 "It is an ambitious prospect, but the idea of being able to drop bombs on the enemy from above is one that would give us an incredible advantage if we can realize it. If our warriors would be supported by these flying contraptions, they would be twice as deadly."
NTR_death_from_above:0 "Flying Reavers"
NTR_death_from_above_desc:0 "This new age demands more than just swords. Larger, high-flying planes can - like the reavers of old - strike deep behind the enemy lines, raze their villages and destroy supply caravans. It is brutal, but such is war."
NTR_final_chord:0 "Sky-Giants"
NTR_final_chord_desc:0 "In the old stories there are tales of giant that could buck rocks the size of a house from across the mountains, crushing unsuspecting ponies' homes in instants. Who would have thought that one day we would be building flying machines with such destructive capacity?"

NTR_military_academy:0 "Everfrost Military Academy"
NTR_military_academy_desc:0 "With all our experience, all our ability and all our determination, we possess the formula to make the art of war into a science to refine and develop like any other."

### Political branch ###

NTR_the_princess_is_back:0 "The Queen is Dead, Long Live the Queen"
NTR_the_princess_is_back_desc:0 "In this, our darkest hour, the North needs a leader more than anyone else. There is only one pony who can claim that role, and she is a young mare, barely twenty winters of age. Yet, by blood and law, princess Fiana must now rise to take her mother's place at the head of a crumbling North."
NTR_centralize_government:0 "Uniting the Tribal Councils"
NTR_centralize_government_desc:0 "Before anything else can be done, the North must come together. Scattered tribal councils arguing against each other will get us nowhere. We must create one centralized government, supported by professional civil servants and institutions. It is time to form the first true government of the Northern Tribes"
NTR_one_country_one_destiny:0 "One Country, One Destiny"
NTR_one_country_one_destiny_desc:0 "The Northern Tribes are not united more than nominally. Each valley and each village is a world unto itself, and if we are to assert the royal perogative then we must establish the idea of one united north, with kinship reaching beyond the village, common goals and shared ideals."
NTR_coronation:0 "The Coronation"
NTR_coronation_desc:0 "Through trials and tribulations, with unflinching determination and great wisdom, princess Fiana now steps up to become the Queen of the Northern Tribes. For the first time in years, our people can look to the future with hope."

# Harmony branch #

NTR_reform_the_cabinet:0 "Create the Royal Council"
NTR_reform_the_cabinet_desc:0 "Power will not, must not, be laid sorely on the shoulders of the Queen. Not only will that overwhelm her, but it will enrage the tribes that see their freedom torn away. Instead, we shall make sure that the greatest and most able of tribal councillors and chieftains have a seat at the queen's table to advise and assist her in the running of the North."
NTR_first_constitution:0 "The Northern Constitution"
NTR_first_constitution_desc:0 "Taking cues from the south, the Queen has decreed that she will agree to be bound by laws specific to her and her role. This Constitution will assure the people that she may never turn on them and become a tyrant. It will also codify the rights of the people, the roles of government and the foundational laws that will bind them all."

NTR_protection_of_values:0 "Protect our Way of Life"
NTR_protection_of_values_desc:0 "We are ponies and griffons of the north. The cold winds blow over our homes, where snow and ice is ever present. We know this, and we are not ashamed of it. Even in this new era, we must remember who we are. That is why we will partner with Vedina, our neighbor and cultural cousin. Together we can show the world the value of the north."
NTR_junior_partner:0 "Vedina's Tutelage"
NTR_junior_partner_desc:0 "Our friends in Turhamn have reacted positively to our offer and are making their own now. In return for preferential treatment for their traders, they will help us develop as a nation and share their technological and industrial know-how. For now we are the little brother, but in time, we will become their equal."
NTR_research_partnership:0 "Scientific Training"
NTR_research_partnership_desc:0 "Vedina's scientists are leagues ahead of us, and Turhamn has decreed that during the coming years, our research efforts shall be joined together so that we can both enjoy the fruits of each others' research."
NTR_civil_investments:0 "Civil Investments"
NTR_civil_investments_desc:0 "The aim of the partnership between our two nations is not to make us out as some useless charity case. We are more than able to invest in Vedina just like how she invests in us and together, our two nations shall prosper."
NTR_joint_development:0 "Joint Development"
NTR_joint_development_desc:0 "Our two nations are facing the future together. Vedina, being our elder brother, will bear the brunt of this push, at least at first, but they will find their little brother a loyal and helpful ally."
NTR_war_measures:0 "Prepare for the Worst"
NTR_war_measures_desc:0 "Neither of our nations are meek lambs waiting for the wolves. We are more than willing to defend ourselves beak and claw if needed, and we will join forces to arm our nations for whatever conflicts might lie ahead."
NTR_research_partnership:0 "Scientific Training"
NTR_research_partnership_desc:0 "Vedina's scientists are leagues ahead of us, and Turhamn has decreed that during the coming years, our research efforts shall be joined together so that we can both enjoy the fruits of each others' research."
NTR_joint_development:0 "Joint Development"
NTR_joint_development_desc:0 "Our two nations are facing the future together. Vedina, being our elder brother, will bear the brunt of this push, at least at first, but they will find their little brother a loyal and helpful ally"
NTR_together_we_are_strong:0 "The Brother Kingdoms"
NTR_together_we_are_strong_desc:0 "Vedina and the Northern Tribes are different in many ways, but like how the tribes of the North came together under one ruler, both kingdoms now come together in a unified cause. From this day onward, we are kin."

NTR_free_trade_focus:0 "Open our Doors to All"
NTR_free_trade_focus_desc:0 "We must rid ourselves of romantic notions of sticking with our kind and look soberly at where we stand. We are a small nation in a distant corner of Griffonia and if we are to get ahead we cannot limit ourselves in trade. Let us throw the doors open and invite whoever wishes to trade with the north, no matter where they are from."
NTR_our_own_future:0 "Our Own Future"
NTR_our_own_future_desc:0 "As we invite any and all potential investors to our homeland, we must make sure to check and balance the various groups that come here. They should each get a slice of the pie, but none must get a too big one. All are welcome, but none will come before the North's future."
NTR_foreign_standarts:0 "Foreign Standards"
NTR_foreign_standarts_desc:0 "One of the bigger issues facing us is the fact that the long isolation has made us develop countless things in a unique direction. It's time that we adapt the griffonian standards in everything from measurements to tools. Farewell hoofwidths, hello centimeters."
NTR_stronghold_of_harmony:0 "Foreign Research Labs"
NTR_stronghold_of_harmony_desc:0 "Our lands hold many unique environments that have attracted the interests of foreign scientists. They have asked us for permission to lease some regions in the area to use for their research. We will have to compensate some of our people for the inconveniences, but the research payoffs will be worth it."
NTR_domestic_policy:0 "Domestic Development"
NTR_domestic_policy_desc:0 "As we begin to expand our industrial basis we may produce things for other nations, but the factories remain in our lands and the payment goes directly to our people, giving them the resources to build up further industries all in the service of the nation."
NTR_war_preparation:0 "Refined Production Methods"
NTR_war_preparation_desc:0 "As more and more companies come to the North, so does more and more methods, and we are making sure to request that our investors share these methods with us. We aren't looking to get involved with industrial espionage, but those who come here will know up front that they must share some of their tricks."
NTR_freedom_for_the_north:0 "A Free and Proud North"
NTR_freedom_for_the_north_desc:0 "We may be small and insignificant to most people, but what little we have we have made much of. We are Northerners; we are free, we are proud and we are fearless, and though none shall call us servant, many shall call us friend."

NTR_SRS_ultimatum:0 "Reclaim the West"
NTR_SRS_ultimatum_desc:0 "We were divided, but now we stand united. We were weak, but now we are strong. Now we look towards the west, where the Skynavian communists still occupy our ancestral homelands. The blood of thousands has already been spilled, and if we can avoid more death then we will do it. Yet whatever comes, Skynavia, crown jewel of the northen coast, will belong to the North again!"  
NTR_enemy_of_the_people:0 "Justice Long Overdue"
NTR_enemy_of_the_people_desc:0 "The communists are in the end little more than bandits and southerner deserters who killed our people and stole our land. Now that we have finally reclaimed our ancestral homes, the time has come to mete out justice."

Ntribes.1.t:0 "The First Winds of Change" #todo
Ntribes.1.d:0 "Across the North, the small single-household farms and fisheries that dot the landscape have worked in similar ways for centuries. Yet now, things have begun to change more and more. New tools and farming practices have spread across the communities, making the old, hard labour easier and easier. While many treat these new oddities with suspicion, the increased benefits are undeniable and bit by bit, the stubborn locals are changing the ways they do things."
Ntribes.1.a:0 "The North is Changing"
Ntribes.2.t:0 "A Stratifying Society" #todo
Ntribes.2.d:0 "For good or ill, the old communities have begun to shift. With new tools, the divide between the haves and the have-nots are becoming more pronounced. As some people have taken to the new methods and tools with eagerness and some have been reluctant, the head start of the former quickly shows itself. While production increases steadily, the number of farms is falling, with more and more ponies having to sell off their old farms to the emerging class of landowners."
Ntribes.2.a:0 "Change is sometimes painful"
Ntribes.3.t:0 "A New Age has Begun" #todo
Ntribes.3.d:0 "The North is nigh unrecognizable these days. The small, tight-knit communities that made up the old tribes are now divided between the landowners, who in many places style themselves 'chiefs' these days, and the landworkers who earn their living working other peoples' fields. Trade is becoming more and more common, and several tribes have devoted themselves fully to a few specialized trades, preferring to buy what else they need. Food is much more plentiful and specialized craftsponies can now devote themselves fully to their crafts. It is a different north, but it is not necessarily a worse one."
Ntribes.3.a:0 "Though I work the fields, at least I eat well."
Ntribes.4.t:0 "Choosing our Investor" #todo
Ntribes.4.d:0 "We cannot build up this nation on our own. The world of today is an increasingly interconnected one, and instead of spending decades trying to reinvent the wheel, we should invite outside interests to have the first dibs on the new market. The question is which nation we shall give this advantage."

Ntribes.9.a:0 ""
Ntribes.10.t:0 "Literacy for all" #todo
Ntribes.10.d:0 "Learning has typically been a privilege in the North. Those who have managed to secure enough food to have time to spare have often found themselves at the feet of the tribal elders to listen and learn. This system, while strengthening the communal bonds, does little to provide the type of education needed if the North is to advance.\n\nWith the help from foreign experts and academics, we are now facing the question of how to implement this new system of universal education. Some have suggested that we let the elders continue to serve their communities as they always have, while others say we must go much further and implement a schooling system like the one in the south, stripping the elders of their traditional roles in the commmunity."
Ntribes.10.a:0 "There is still a place for the elders." #todo
Ntribes.10.b:0 "We must go all the way." #todo
Ntribes.11.t:0 "Making Progress" #todo
Ntribes.11.d:0 "Good news! Our people have taken to our efforts to improve literacy more than well. What once was seen as a privilege has now become a right, and all over the North fillies and adults alike are taking every chance they get to learn. More than once, the village longhouses are repurposed as schools, and the teachers sent out there are given respect and indeed reverence from most of their students."
Ntribes.11.a:0 "Our people know to take this opportunity."
Ntribes.12.t:0 "A Literate North"
Ntribes.12.d:0 "After intensive and drawn out efforts, we have managed to elevate our people. Once the purview of the elders and the griffon traders, now reading, writing, arithmetic and basic science knowledge is available to the vast majority of our people, with more learning every day. The potential in our people can now be realized on a scale undreamed of before."
Ntribes.12.a:0 "Well done!"
Ntribes.13.t:0 "Assistance from the Outside" #todo
Ntribes.13.d:0 "We aren't going to industrialize our country on our own. Instead we must acquire aid from the outside world. This, in and of itself, is a controversial move on our part as the tribes' historic isolationism means that foreigners are viewed with suspicion. Two possibilities have risen as a response to this.\n\nThe first one has proposed we turn to Vedina. Of all the nations out there, they are our closest and oldest neighbors. While we open to the outside world, we remember where we came from.\n\nThe others say we should open our doors completely and trade more freely. We possess an unequalled location for trade along the north sea, and should exploit this."
Ntribes.13.a:0 "Let us see what our old neighbor thinks of the idea." #todo

Ntribes.14.d:0 "After a few weeks of negotiating, we have successfully reached an agreement with Vedina. Details are forthcoming, but already Vedina is beginning to arrange to recruit engineers and specialists among their people to come north and aid us in developing our homeland. Our faith in our old neighbors wasn't misplaced after all it seems."

Ntribes.16.d:0 "Hundreds, if not thousands, of Vedinan engineers, architects and laborers are working side by side with the northern tribesponies and griffons, building up the nation. Side by side, they lay railroad tracks and open factories, some even going so far to settle here as their work finishes, bringing over their families or intermarrying with the locals. Not only is the North growing fast, but the bond between our two nations is growing fast."
Ntribes.16.a:0 "We are thankful for their help."
Ntribes.17.t:0 "Industrialization."
Ntribes.17.d:0 "As time passes, the north is seeing more and more signs of the modern era. Factories are springing up in various places, even in surprisingly remote such, and tribesponies pour in from all over to seek work in these new industries. Bit by bit, train tracks are being laid, binding the north together and opening up formerly isolated regions to the world. As the smoke from locomotives and smokestacks rise over the landscape, the marks of the new North lie clear for all to see."
Ntribes.17.a:0 "We're no longer a backwater"
Ntribes.18.t:0 "A Walk through Everfrost."
Ntribes.18.d:0 "Fiana walked through the streets of Everfrost, looking around herself. How things had changed she thought. It felt like yesterday that Everfrost was a sleepy little town with few buildings of note, and yet now...\n\nStopping at the market, she looked to the west and the old quarter that was being torn down, with new, modern two-story buildings being erected in its place. Already the Tribal Council had been replaced with a new, grandiose hall fit for a king, and more was to come. Looking the other way, she could see the smokestacks from the factories down by the coastline, even the line of workers on their way to their shifts.\n\nIt was not much, and most of Everfrost was as it always had been, but she could tell that a new age was here. In time, she and her people would make this place equal to any southern city."
Ntribes.18.a:0 "Things are looking up!"
Ntribes.19.t:0 "Industry and Progress."
Ntribes.19.d:0 "With Skynavian aid, the North is finally marching forwards. For centuries, the people of the north have been trapped in rural poverty. Now though, the railroad is slowly creeping from West to East, and new methods and tools are being imported and implemented. Soon, the Socialist struggle will have elevated the people of the North in a way that in centuries they leaders never could."
Ntribes.19.a:0 "Progress for all."
Ntribes.20.t:0 "Progress under the Red Banner"
Ntribes.20.d:0 "We can all be proud of the achievements of the last months. In one giant leap, the North has stepped from being a rural backwater up towards modernity. There is still much left to do, with many valleys and villages isolated, and though industrialization has begun, it is not yet finished. All the same though, the comrades of the Free North and of Skynavia can all stand proud, with their achievments laid plain for all to see."

Ntribes.100.d:0 "The issue of the day had been hounding Fiana for most of the last week. She had barely gotten any sleep last night and kept herself up through the long council sessions with plentiful use of coffee. For days now, the debates had raged about the contents of the constitution, and while many issues had been addressed, the big issue had still been hovering over them.\n\nWhat was her role to be?\n\nMany had argued for an executive monarchy to give her the final say in all matters of state, while others had wanted the power to be kept mainly with the tribal council. Now, after three days of debating, they had gotten nowhere and Fiana pondered the fact that she had caused this situation herself. Her past triumphs meant they were willing to have the ultimate say in where the the nation's executive power would lie, even if that meant she invested it all in herself.\n\nStill...  why shouldn't she? She was the one who had outwitted the communists and she was the one who brought peace back to the land. Maybe it was for the best that she kept the final say? Rising up, she decided to state her desire."

### Political events ###

Ntribes.500.t:0 "Chaos in the Castle"
Ntribes.500.d:0 "Princess Fiana sat quietly in her room. Having only just arrived home, she struggled to deal with the news that she had been given about her mother.\n\nThe peace talks had been a failure. War had been inevitable. And then the explosion had hit, killing several, including her mother.\n\nOutside the door, the council members and chieftains were arguing across the palace; she could hear them even in here. Angry accusations, even threats, were flying everywhere, and the tribes that still were loyal were starting to fracture. What was she meant to do? She did not have her mother's strength. She was barely more than a filly to many of the ponies out there.\n\nStill... she knew the bitter fact of the matter was that right now, the north did not have anyone else. If she didn't do anything, who would?"
Ntribes.500.a:0 "The North hangs in the balance."
Ntribes.501.t:0 "The rumblings of discontent"
Ntribes.501.d:0 "As the doors to the throne room slammed shut, Fiana sank slowly down in her throne, exhaling deeply. They chieftains were angry. Of course they were angry. As one of them had said: "your mother is barely dead in the ground and you are already tearing the North apart!".\n\nShe wondered what they were imagining would have happened. Should all remain the same, with their positions secure and their traditions unspoilt, even as the North was crumbling in this new age? She had placated them as best as she could, but she could tell from the look she gave her that this wasn't over yet, not by a long shot."
Ntribes.501.a:0 "It will only get worse from here"
Ntribes.502.t:0 "The Communists are on the move"
Ntribes.502.d:0 ""As it stands, your majesty, the communists are gaining ground day by day" the council member explained."They've already turned a several tribes away from you, and if this continues... there may not be anypony left to fight for you if it goes far enough."\n\nFiana listened quietly, her face unreadable even as she, inwardly, was strugling with whether she should start crying or start throwing things. Couldn't they at least have been weakened as well after the explosion? Instead, they seemed to have only been empowered, with reports coming in daily about how they were acting with impunity, openly defying the tribal councils and her both.\n\nEnemies in the palace and enemies in the mountains... what had she gotten herself into?"
Ntribes.502.a:0 "Damn those rebels"
Ntribes.503.t:0 "The servants start leaving"
Ntribes.503.d:0 "It had started as only single missing servants and Fiana had quickly ordered an investigation, fearing the worst. As it turned out, it had not been a crazed killer or something. Rather, ponies were beginning to abandon the castle out of fear that they would become targets.\n\nFiana was happy that no one had been hurt, but the more ponies began to leave, the more it felt like everything was just slipping out of her hooves. Not even the people who worked for her had any faith left in her, and every new servant that left tore up another hole in what little legitimacy she still had.\n\n"Tell the servants that whoever stays gets a raise... fifty percent more pay." she told the chancellor.\n\n"Your majesty, we don't have the money for that," he replied quietly.\n\n"I know, but either we lose legitimacy or we lose money. We'll have to find the money somehow," she sighed.\n\nOne thing after another..."
Ntribes.503.a:0 "What is next...?"
Ntribes.504.t:0 "The tribes defy the princess"
Ntribes.504.d:0 "The old councilpony stood defiantly in front of the princess, unflinching, as he gave her the message. "...in this matter, we are united. You are not fit to lead the North, and your path will be the death of us as a people. We are not going to rise in mutiny, but we will not support your mad notions. Until you see the error of your ways, we are not going to bow to you in any way, nor do we have anything to discuss with you." With that, the old stallion turned around and left Fiana sitting on the throne and the entire throne room staring after him. A guard came up next to Fiana, looking to her as he clenched his spear, but Fiana shook her head and motioned for the stallion to be allowed to leave.\n\nNearly a third of the tribes has already declared their intent to not follow her lead, and Fiana knew that if she struck him down, that would only further exacerbate the situation. It was too late, and she didn't have the army to violently enforce control. Yet, nor did she have the money, or the loyalty of the people, leaving her to ponder what precisely she did have."

Fiana knew why: the tribal councils would rather neuter their business and the socialists would tear them down. She really was their only hope.\n\nAll the same, the large shipment of weapons that was lined up in front of her was more than welcome. She knew well that most nations in Griffonia would view them as antiques, but to her people they were top modern. Looking to the guild representative, she bowed her head and he bowed deeply in return."

In the distance, from what she could tell by the merchants' quarter, a giant plume of smoke was rising towards the sky, debris and embers raining down across the city. \n\nStorming out of her room, Fiana met the servants that were coming to wake her up in the hallway and barked at them to bring her the guard captain and her advisors and to find out what had happened. Within fifteen minutes, her ponies had gathered and the facts laid bare for them. Someone had bombed the arsenal, blowing up most of the weapons donated by the guilds and killing dozens. The gathered crowd looks to Fiana, awaiting her command." 
Ntribes.551.a:0 "I want the perpetrators found now!" #(Harmony)
Ntribes.551.b:0 "I... double the guards, try to calm the situation..." #(Non-aligned)
Ntribes.552.t:0 "Results of the investigation"
Ntribes.552.d:0 "In the throne room, Fiana listened quietly to the report given by the guard captain. "...in short, we know the communists are responsible, but we have not been able to track them down. With your blessing, we will continue the investigations to find out where they are."\n\n"Do so," Fiana ordered him and the guard departed, leaving her to ponder the situation. What few loyal servants she still had did all they could, but Fiana worried. This wasn't an act by some outsider group. It couldn't have been.\n\nWhoever did this had access to the building, and that meant they had contacts within the castle. The enemy wasn't just out lurking out there in the forests and mountains; it was coiled around the very heart of her reign as well."
Ntribes.552.a:0 "Who can I even trust...?"
Ntribes.553.t:0 "Another explosion"
Ntribes.553.d:0 "Fiana had been eating dinner when the the detonation hit. The sound by now was familiar and she instantly rushed to the window, looking outside and seeing how, in the distance, the guard barracks was burning. Heading to the throne room to receive information, she was greeted by a dirty, wounded guard captain who was helped inside by two servants.\n\n"Your majesty..." the stallion coughed. "They... got inside the barracks somehow. I managed to save the dossier from the investigation... but my guards..." he gasped before Fiana told him to save his breath and for healers to be sent after.\n\n"Your Majesty... what should we do?" a servant asked Fiana, who looked around herself, seeing the fear in their eyes. She had to do something, anything..." # can anyone rewrite this? 
Ntribes.553.a:0 "Keep investigating, we are going to find these bastards!" #(Harmony)
Ntribes.553.b:0 "I... I..." #(Communism)
Ntribes.553.c:0 "G-get more guards out there, somehow..." #(Non-aligned)
Ntribes.554.t:0 "The results of the second investigation"
Ntribes.554.d:0 "Fiana met with her generals alone, without prying eyes. After weeks of chaos and investigations, they had tracks lead to the east and to the Vastmush area, where the communist hold was at its strongest.\n\n"Shall I send out the call for loyal warriors?" Adam - the oldest and most loyal of all her generals and a trusted advisor - asked her. "We still have enough support that in a direct battle, we can crush them easily. Let us go forth and prove the crown's strength in open battle!" Several generals murmured in agreement.\n\n"Mother met them openly..." Fiana said quietly.\n\n"Your majesty?" the general asked, Fiana shaking her head. She didn't like this, but the generals were insisting they could break the backs of the communists. All they needed was her approval."
Ntribes.554.a:0 "I don't like this."#(Harmony)
Ntribes.554.b:0 "Rally the warriors, we will crush them!" #(Communist/Non-aligned)
Ntribes.555.t:0 "Preparations for the March to the East"
Ntribes.555.d:0 ""How many warriors have been gathered?" Fiana asked, looking out over the crowd gathered in front of the palace.\n\n"Nearly a thousand loyal fighters, all ready to die if need be," the general told her proudly. "We only await your command to march east and crush the communists with overwhelming force!"\n\nFiana looked out over the crowd. So many young ponies and griffons... some of them seemed even younger than her. They all just needed her word to march out and they'd eagerly fight for her, and everyone expected it of her. She just needed to give the word, push down the worries in the back of her head and have faith in them."
Ntribes.555.a:0 "Good luck my warriors..." #(Communism or Neutrality)
Ntribes.555.b:0 "No, this is a foolish prospect!" #(Harmony)
Ntribes.556.t:0 "Clashing in the woods"
Ntribes.556.d:0 "In the light of a single lamp, Fiana read the report from her warriors. They had met the enemy near the river crossing to Sleetfell and routed them. The report triumphantly extolled the bravery and ferocity of her warriors and how they were going to drive the enemy before them all the way to Vashmush and into their graves. She should be happy, but she just wondered how many more would die before this was done.\n\nAlso... the issue of the mole in her court kept gnawing at her. She still wasn't convinced that there wasn't someone close to her who in truth was a traitor. The others talked of honor and loyalty, and that such a thing could never happen, but Fiana had seen and learned too much to be able to buy into such a thing. Maybe she was just being paranoid though... yes, maybe that was it... but what if she wasn't?"
Ntribes.556.a:0 "I guess I just have to trust them..." #(Communism)
Ntribes.556.b:0 "This is going too well, abort the attack!" #(Harmony)
Ntribes.557.t:0 "Ambush!"
Ntribes.557.d:0 "The exhausted warrior came stumbling into the castle, panting and shivering with exhaustion, and collapsed to the ground in front of the throne. "Y-your majesty..." he gasped, turning up to look at Fiana, who had turned from her discussion with the guard captain.\n\n"What's going on... wait, you were with the warriors we sent out, weren't you?" Fiana asked, coming down to kneel by his side. The warrior nodded slowly.\n\n"They... they ambushed us... we had pursued them for days, we were exhausted... I tried to tell the general, but they wouldn't listen... then the communists hit... we were too weak to put up a fight... they're all dead... oh gods, they killed us all!"\n\nSlowly, Fiana rose up, stumbling away as she tried to process what had happened. Hundreds of warriors dead... the great push that they had said would end the communists only leaving them with a great victory... what was she going to do?"
Ntribes.557.a:0 "This is a disaster..."
Ntribes.558.t:0 "Failed investigation!"
Ntribes.558.d:0 "Fiana stared down at the latest report from the guard captain. Months of investigations with nothing to show for it. She sat down heavily, feeling a headache coming on. Whoever the moles in her court were, they weren't stupid. They had realized that Fiana was looking for them and were laying low. Right now time was on their side, so all they had to do was to wait for her authority to utterly collapse.\n\nShe couldn't meet them in battle, nor could she track them down. It was like trying to capture smoke, and it kept slipping out of her grasp, no matter what she did."
Ntribes.558.a:0 "What are we going to do now?"
Ntribes.559.t:0 "The tribes are getting out of control"
Ntribes.559.d:0 "Another group of tribes have turned away from you, your majesty," the advisor said quietly as Fiana stared at the map, where the loyal tribes were marked in blue and the tribes turning away from her in red. There were so few blue dots left. "Your majesty, unless we think of something now, I fear we may have to consider whether we can actually win this struggle." Fiana nodded as she listened, trying to keep her emotions in check. No matter what she did, it seemed like the communists knew of it and could counter it."
Ntribes.559.a:0 "Maybe we should consider a more underhanded approach." #(Harmony or Communism)
Ntribes.559.b:0 "I... I don't know what to do..." #(Neutrality)
Ntribes.560.t:0 "Infiltration groups created"
Ntribes.560.d:0 "If there was any stallion that Fiana trusted, it was the guard captain. Along with him, she had picked out several ponies and griffons in order for something insane. She wasn't privy to the details, having silently slipped the old stallion a note with the orders along with a reminder that she was not to be told anything before he had succeeded.\n\n Now, somewhere, the guard captain was preparing his hand-picked champions to try to infiltrate the communists. Fiana knew that they would be smelling blood in the water, and hopefully they would be reckless enough that they would not vet their new recruits too much. Fianna, meanwhile, could only wait and pray that it would work out. There was nothing else she could do right now."
Ntribes.560.a:0 "Let's give the schemers a taste of their own medicine."
Ntribes.561.t:0 "A nighttime message"
Ntribes.561.d:0 "A note slipped in under the Fiana's door in the middle of the night, and the princess retrieved it quickly, opening it to read. It was brief, only saying "found a good fishing spot, will build a weir". This brief message was enough to leave her pumping her hoof in sudden relief. He had done it, the old stallion actually had managed to slip his informants into the communists' ranks. Finally they had an edge over the rebels."
Ntribes.561.a:0 "We are getting closer."
Ntribes.562.t:0 "A pivotal dress-choice"
Ntribes.562.d:0 "Fiana laid on her bed, staring up at the ceiling as she pondered what clothes to wear tomorrow.\n\nAnother message from her agents had come. A trap was being laid within the communist ranks, a faked message that would seem as though Fiana was completely losing it. Whoever took the bait would think they had a golden opportunity to undermine the throne, whereupon, hopefully, her agents could track down the moles and deal with them.\n\nThe issue was who to target. The tribal council had been against her from day one, so they would seem the obvious target. Yet, Fiana found herself wondering. The council might be antagonistic, but they were straightforward, and argued openly with her. The other option was the generals... but they had fought the communists, would they really be loyal to the people they had been killing?\n\nFiana thought back on everything that had happened, trying to remember where things had gone wrong and who could be responsible. She needed to make a choice, because that choice would determine what she would wear in order to let the agents know who to target."
Ntribes.562.a:0 "White, bait the tribal council." #(Communism)
Ntribes.562.b:0 "Blue, tempt the generals." #(Harmony)
Ntribes.562.c:0 "I can't decide... wear grey, I have to think more on this..." #(Neutrality)
Ntribes.563.t:0 "The fish ate the bait"
Ntribes.563.d:0 ""Salmon for dinner" the message slipped under her door had said, leaving Fiana to pace nervously back and forth in her room. They had actually done it. The bait had been swallowed, and her agents had a target; a low-ranking officer. She had put two lanterns in her window to signal that they should wait and see if he would meet with his co-conspirators, and now all she could do was to wait.\n\nIt was unbelievable. She struggled to believe what she was hearing, that the defenders of the North in actuality was in kahoots with those who wanted to destroy it. Yet, the evidence was there, and now all she could do was to wait for the hammer to fall on them."
Ntribes.563.a:0 "Ready your swords and follow quietly."
Ntribes.564.t:0 "Rat's den"
Ntribes.564.d:0 "It was the dead of night, but the longhouse was filled with noise and action. Voices inside were eagerly taking, and while the exact words could not be made out, the cheery tone was unmistakeable.\n\nOutside the doors, agents were quietly readying themselves, holding their weapons tightly. A silent nod from the guard captain, a signal, then two large stallions bucked the doors down and the agents stormed inside, weapons raised. The chaos was brief, but intense. A couple of griffons outside took to the air and tried to escape out the windows only to get shot down, a pony threw himself after a weapon only to be pierced by several spears. After a few seconds, the chaos abated as the traitors were rounded up and clasped in fetters.\n\n"How dare you?!" the aged griffon yelled, struggling against the restraints. "Her majesty will hear about this, you will..."\n\n"I already know," Fiana said, dropping her cloak as she stepped forth between two agents, staring the old general down.\n\n"Y-your majesty..." the general began, Fiana cutting him off.\n\n"Save it for the trial, traitor. Take them away." With the order given, the agents marched the conspirators out of the longhouse and towards the castle where the dungeons awaited them."
Ntribes.564.a:0 "The head of the snake has been cut off."
Ntribes.565.t:0 "The North falls silent" #(Harmony)
Ntribes.565.d:0 "The chieftains and the councilmembers stood all gathered before the throne where Fiana sat tall and proud. After the recent events, it was like a great weight had lifted off her back, and as she spoke she did so with greater conviction and force than they could remember her having shown before.\n\n"You all know that the communist traitors have been flushed out and are awaiting their sentencing in the dungeons. I have decreed that any communist who wishes to lay down their weapons will receive full amnesty, and already hundreds of warriors have taken the offer. I have called you all here to ask that you reaffirm your vows to the throne.\n\nThe communist threat is dealt with for now, but it will return again and it will do so precisely because we stand divided. I do not want the North to fall to these southern invaders, nor do you, and I no longer sit so unsteadily on this throne that I will crumble from a few dissident tribes.\n\nAll of you... I know you may have your reservations about what I do, but I ask that you look to my accomplishments, and place your faith in me. Not for my sake, but for the sake of our people, our history and our very way of life. I will defend those things, no matter what I must do. Will you?" she asked, looking around the room.\n\nIt started in the corner, where an aged councilpony slowly got down to her knees, creating a ripple effect as ponies and griffons all bowed their heads to her."
Ntribes.565.a:0 "The tribes stand as one behind Fiana."
Ntribes.566.t:0 "Great Scandal"
Ntribes.566.d:0 "Everfrost is being rocked by the recent news out of the tribal council. The guards of one of councillors caught a spy who, after interrogation, was revealed to work for the Princess. This led to the rapid unravelling of an entire network of spies and agents in the middle of a grand plot to try to bait and frame the council to undermine their authority.\n\n The few councillors who still were on the princess' side are swiftly turning away from her, and calls are coming from more and more ponies to depose Fiana."
Ntribes.566.a:0 "Has she gone mad?!"
Ntribes.567.t:0 "Not our princess"
Ntribes.567.d:0 "Fiana looked out through the window, staring down at the angry crowd gathering outside the castle, held back only by a line of guards. She could see their faces even from up here, see their anger and their resentment. They were calling for her to step down, and even now more ponies and griffins were joining in.\n\nHow could it all have gone so wrong? All this death, all this struggling... all for naught, and her people were turning against her. The monarchy established to help the North was now resented by it, her mother had died in vain and Fiana, for all her struggling, had only reaped failure."

Ntribes.575.d:0 "Her mother's grave was beautiful. The large stone was polished to a shine, and the name "Queen Fiana" was written on it in gold along with the dates of her birth and death. Standing in front of it, Fiana II felt the memories come back to her: the chaos after her mother's death, the funeral where she had been in too much shock to do much other than stare, the chaotic fight against the communists and the realization of just how deeply their influence had pierced.\n\n"Hello mom..." Fiana spoke quietly. "I'm sorry I haven't visited you until now." Slowly, the princess sat down next to the gravestone, looking up at the sky. "I don't know how I managed to get through all this, but somehow I did... The communists are probably done for, at least outside of Skynavia, and the tribal councils are starting to come around to me... Somehow..." Weakly, the now undisputed ruler of the north chuckled.\n\n"Now they all think I am some great Queen meant for songs and legends, not just a terrified mare who grasped at straws and managed to pull victory out of thin air... Or maybe I'm too hard on myself, I just don't know. I..." coming to a halt, Fiana suddenly sniffed, tears beginning to slowly trickle down her face. "I miss you mommy..." she sobbed, "I miss you so much... why did I succeed where you failed? Why did you have to die...?" Her voice trailed off into despondent weeping, and for almost an hour, the princess of the Northern Tribes cried - for the first time - over her mother's death.\n\nAs she slowly recovered, wiped the tears out of her eyes and looked to her mother's name again."I won't let this chance go to waste mom, I swear. I've united our peoples, and I'll give them a better future. Just... I wish you could be here to see it." Rising up, Fiana brushed some of the snow off the gravestone, trailing her hoof over her mother's name. "I love you mom..." she whispered before turning to depart, wiping her eyes as she walked back to her escort. She was going to be a Queen now, after all, and a Queen couldn't be seen crying openly."

Ntribes.996.t:0 "With progress comes poverty"
Ntribes.996.d:0 "The North is rapidly transforming, with a people that was mainly sustenance farmers and fishers now finding themselves more and more leaving behind their small villages, moving to the cities and trying to find work in the new world of industry and manufacturing.\n\nThis has not been a smooth process, and many are left impoverished, struggling to find jobs and coming to cluster in the shanty towns that are springing up around the towns."
Ntribes.996.a:0 "We must do something."
Ntribes.994.t:0 "A slowly opening land"
Ntribes.994.d:0 "The North has been isolated ever since its inception. The far, frozen forests and hills have not had much to offer most of the world, and the people who lived there preferred to be left alone. This, however, is slowly changing. For the first time in forever, the outside is taking an interest in the North, just like how it is taking interest in the world. Foreigners are a more and more common, and the exchange of people, ideas and goods is becoming more and more commonplace."
Ntribes.994.a:0 "Out into the world we go!"
Ntribes.993.t:0 "Part of the world"
Ntribes.993.d:0 "The North is no longer a distant land of no interest to anyone, but rather a slowly emerging presence in the world. While we are still a small figure globally, we are starting to leave our mark more and more. As people speak of "The North", they are starting to refer to our nation, and our people now can enjoy the fruits of the rest of the world's labors through trade and travel both. It has been a long road, but now we wander it along with other nations."
