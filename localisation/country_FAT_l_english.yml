 FAT_aiding_the_generals_desc:0 "Alexander Kemerskai has done nothing in the last 30 years but sit in his presidential palace and make speeches while his nation collapses around him.

 FST_the_dream_is_not_dead_desc:0 "While we certainly cannot directly use Republican symbols, we can still appeal to liberal and republican citizens.

 FST_looking_out_desc:0 "We are not alone in the North, and although we have somewhat reconciled with the Empire, there are still enemies who would quash our dream if they could.

 FST_increase_military_influence_desc:0 "The military of the Duchy of Cloudbury deserves higher influence in the nation! After all, they were the ones who restored Duke Oskar Plumenjar to the throne.

 FAT_new_navy_desc:0 "Since the birth of our Republic, we didn't have even a single vessel under our command. It is time to change this. With the establishment of a proper Navy, we have a great opportunity to rule the seas in northern Griffonia."
 FAT_battleship_focus:0 "Saxhagen-Plumenjar Doctrine"
 FAT_battleship_focus_desc:0 "Otto Saxhagen-Plumenjar is loosely related to the Cloudburian royal family, and is technically the heir to the remnants of the dynasty. Despite his royal blood, Kemerskai kept him and his mother alive, and allowed him to become an admiral as a concession to monarchists. Otto is a strong proponent of naval forces that can squash the enemy through sheer numbers, armour, and calibre."
 FAT_destroyer_focus:0 "Hassentelf Doctrine"
 FAT_destroyer_focus_desc:0 "Hermann Hassentelf is a prominent and loyal Republican admiral, serving in the Revolution of 978 as a naval officer and being promoted to Admiral after the Long March. Due to his lack of access to battleships and carriers as an officer, he has become an expert and a strong supporter of a smaller strike fleet. He argues that battleships and too slow for fast-paced naval combat."
 FAT_submarine_focus:0 "Hit and Run"
 FAT_submarine_focus_desc:0 "Cornelius Helltalon has visited the Changeling Lands more than once, and has become convinced of their Naval Focus on the so called 'Submarine'. Using this type of vessel, Cornelius says, we will be able to raid and ambush enemy fleets as easy as pie, with no chance to be hunted down afterwards."
 FAT_navy_investment:0 "Expand Winghagen Ports"
 FAT_navy_investment_desc:0 "The City-port of Winghagen is one of the biggest cities in the Republic, not to mention that its harbours and shipyards are among the biggest in all of northern Griffonia. Nonetheless, there are obvious problems, as most of the equipment used there is obsolete. If we spared some of our funds and nationalised all shipyards there, we could easily make Winghagen into the greatest port of northern Griffonia."
 FAT_navy_doctrine:0 "Perfect Naval Doctrines"
 FAT_navy_doctrine_desc:0 "Our new Admiralty has been lost in arguments for the longest time now, unable to make up their minds on how to proceed in terms of Naval specialisation. It is time we gave them a clear direction on where we are headed with our Naval Doctrine."
 FAT_new_battleships:0 "Research Battleships"
 FAT_new_battleships_desc:0 "Battleships shall be the unquestioned rulers of naval warfare. It is clear to us that they will decide all naval battles, and as such, we should strive towards getting some of our own. A good way to start would be using our new shipyards in Winghaven to construct new battleships. There are talks about two promising projects we could develop there, the Dreadnought-class and the Atreus-class."
 FAT_new_destroyers:0 "Research Destroyers"
 FAT_new_destroyers_desc:0 "Destroyers form the backbone of every naval force in the world, and that won't change anytime soon. There are already many types of them in use, many of which are more technologically advanced then whatever we could hope to create. As such, we should buy a few of them in not-so-great-condition, take them apart, learn everything we can from them, and then use that knowledge to base our own projects on."
 FAT_new_submarines:0 "Experimental Submarine Models"
 FAT_new_submarines_desc:0 ""Submarines" are a relatively new ship prototype that can go under the water and torpedo boats without even being recognized! Our Admirality should inspect foreign models from nations such as Equestria and eventually build some submarines for our own."
 FAT_more_navy_investment:0 "A Second Port On Sky Bay"
 FAT_more_navy_investment_desc:0 "Our only port on Sky Bay is in the city of Winghaven. However, if Winghaven gets destroyed by an enemy or even by a natural disaster, we would have no naval port to dock our ships. A port on the Feathisian border would work well to intimidate the Griffonian Empire and establish another port more south than Winghaven."
 FAT_perfect_the_saxhagen_plumenjar_doctrine:0 "Perfect The Saxhagen-Plumenjar Doctrine"
 FAT_perfect_the_saxhagen_plumenjar_doctrine_desc:0 "With new battleship designs researched, our admirality now can perfect Admiral Saxhagen-Plumenjar's doctrine. A navy made out of dreadnoughts and battleships will humble the fleets of Feathisia and any other enemies that could think to stand against us on the seas."
 FAT_perfect_the_hassentelf_doctrine:0 "Perfect The Hassentelf Doctrine"
 FAT_perfect_the_hassentelf_doctrine_desc:0 "Hermann Hassentelf has perfected his doctrine of destroyers and cruisers. Already they are being mass produced in our dockyards and docked in our naval bases. In time, our fleets will storm through Sky Bay and overwhelm the empire's capital ships with sheer numbers and firepower."
 FAT_perfect_the_marines:0 "The Republican Marine Corps"
 FAT_perfect_the_marines_desc:0 "Now that we have superior ships, dockyards, ports, and naval bases, we can now perfect our amphibious assault tactics. The Republican Marine Corps will be formed, and we will truly rule the waves - not Skyfall, the Empire, but the Republic will rule the seas."
 FAT_new_airforce:0 "New Republican Air Forces"
 FAT_new_airforce_desc:0 "Only a few of the most powerful countries on the Griffonian continent have Air Forces, and we should do our best to join them in that. Having an efficient, large Air Force to contest the skies and aid our advance down below would greatly aid our war effort."
 FAT_fighter_focus:0 "Rule the Skies"
 FAT_fighter_focus_desc:0 "The most important part of air warfare is to have control over the skies, and as such, we should focus our efforts on creating planes that would let us do that. Our planes should be relatively small and agile, while remaining a deadly threat."
 FAT_bomber_focus:0 "Death From Above"
 FAT_bomber_focus_desc:0 "The biggest premise of this new air warfare is destroying as much of the enemy industry and infrastructure as we want. We should focus on creating planes that can carry as many bombs as possible, while allowing them to strike deep into enemy territory."
 FAT_air_doctrine:0 "Seek Foreign Expertise"
 FAT_air_doctrine_desc:0 "Seeing as how we lack our own professional pilots, we should focus our attention on establishing contacts with veterans from other nations. If we were to give enough of our funds to such pilots, they probably would be very excited and eager to work with us, and we could make them share their experience about air tactics and strategy."
 FAT_new_bombers:0 "Acquire New Bomber Blueprints"
 FAT_new_bombers_desc:0 "Foreign Pilots that have come to us from other countries sometimes brought something additional other than knowledge with them. If we were to splice everything together, we might be able to recreate working blueprints."
 FAT_new_fighters:0 "Commission New Fighters"
 FAT_new_fighters_desc:0 "Our new Pilots have asked us to commission a new set of Fighters. After a few talks and backroom deals, the pilots have helped our scientists develop new Fighter models for themselves to use."
 FAT_grand_1:0 "Rosewing's Defensive Doctrine"
 FAT_grand_1_desc:0 "We need to plan every attack, every defence, every retreat, and every advance. We need to change our army into something reminiscent of a clockwork, where every action is well-timed and well-planned."
 FAT_grand_2:0 "Strengthen Engineer Brigades"
 FAT_grand_2_desc:0 "To make sure our units are able to follow our meticulous orders, we need to make sure they will keep their positions. As such, we should focus on adding specialised units whose main task is to fortify areas that our troops are currently occupying."
 FAT_grand_3:0 "Reshuffle Our HQ"
 FAT_grand_3_desc:0 "Our recent changes in our army have, as of now, mostly taken care of our top commanders and our units, but we haven't done anything about most of our HQ, or about less important generals. Today, this will change, as we will make sure every one of them will follow our doctrine of extensive planning."
 FAT_grand_4:0 "Sicameonese Defensive Tactics"
 FAT_grand_4_desc:0 "The Sicameonese army maintained vigiliance against the Griffonian Empire for centuries, guarding itself as a decentralised republic in the face of a looming threat. When Grover I attacked in 773, they united and repelled him. We must learn from history, and adapt these tactics to form a defensive army that will make the lives of any soldiers who dare to invade us a living hell."
 FAT_superior_1:0 "Kemerskai's Balanced Doctrine"
 FAT_superior_1_desc:0 "Why waste the lives of our citizens and our commanders' ability to think independently if we could just throw hundreds, if not thousands of artillery shells at the enemy?"
 FAT_superior_2:0 "Introduce Military Police"
 FAT_superior_2_desc:0 "Our army isn't the most disciplined bunch. This has become increasingly worrying to our commanders, who now run the risk of bombarding our own troopers during artillery barrages, simply because said troopers wanted to gain glory for themselves. We must install a proper sense of order and discipline in these soldiers!"
 FAT_superior_3:0 "Dedicated Artillery Units"
 FAT_superior_3_desc:0 "With dedicated Artillery Regiments, we can more effectively coordinate Artillery bombardments with troop movements, resulting in even less friendly fire and more accurate barrages."
 FAT_superior_4:0 "The Power of Artillery"
 FAT_superior_4_desc:0 "With our amassed guns, we now have the ability to utilise the so-called 'Creeping Barrage' tactic, which we can use to scare enemies out of their hiding places before an advance."
 FAT_mass_1:0 "Suntail's Offensive Doctrine"
 FAT_mass_1_desc:0 "While producing millions of extra shells or drawing up extensive battleplans sounds good, it is also very time intensive and not worth the effort. Instead, we should attempt to draft every able-bodied griffon, hand him a gun and send him to the front. That way, we will have no shortage of troops, and we will be practically unbeatable."
 FAT_mass_2:0 "Convince Militias To Join"
 FAT_mass_2_desc:0 "There are many more or less loyal local militias roaming our country. If we could get in contact with their leaders, and hopefully offer them amnesty, riches, or just promise to grant them some enemy to shoot at, we might be able to get many of these militias to join our army as the backbone of new units."
 FAT_mass_3:0 "Amnesty Program"
 FAT_mass_3_desc:0 "Instead of offering amnesty only to leaders and officers, we will offer it to every griffon who has ever fought against us. This will surely help us bolster the ranks."
 FAT_mass_4:0 "Redemption in Death"
 FAT_mass_4_desc:0 "We could extend our Amnesty Program to every prisoner, POW, terrible criminal, or just common thief in our Country. We will give them all the chance to redeem themselves, no matter what crimes they have committed, so long as they agree to fight in our ranks."
 FAT_an_academy_in_the_north:0 "Lostgate Military Academy"
 FAT_an_academy_in_the_north_desc:0 "While Cloudbury has many military schools, the north is severely lacking in academies teaching military strategy. To rectify this, the Republic has created the "Lostgate Military Academy", which will provide training in tactics and strategy to generals and researches in the north."
 FAT_marshal_rifle:0 "Retake Control of the Stockpiles"
 FAT_marshal_rifle_desc:0 "If there is ample amount of something in our country, it would be guns. From all the conflicts that took place recently, and also because of the increased militarisation in general, it isn’t even that hard to find places with unguarded stockpiles of them. By regaining control over these vast amounts of stockpiles, we could use the weapons to bolster and arm the ranks of the Army."
 FAT_marshal_rifle_quality:0 "Quality over Quantity"
 FAT_marshal_rifle_quality_desc:0 "After gathering this many guns, our military staff has realised that the Quantity of guns doesn't matter if the gun itself is faulty and outdated. We will instead use our expertise to create better, higher quality weapons."
 FAT_marshal_rifle_quantity:0 "All Griffons To The Factories"
 FAT_marshal_rifle_quantity_desc:0 "All you need to fight a bad guy is a gun. And if that don't work, use more gun."
 FAT_arty:0 "Modernise Artillery Guns"
 FAT_arty_desc:0 "Now that our troops are properly equipped with rifles, we need to turn our attention towards bigger calibre artillery guns. If we were to use the experience we have gathered while working on the carbines, it's quite possible we would be able to greatly improve our current design."
 FAT_sup:0 "Reorganise Support Units"
 FAT_sup_desc:0 "While the frontline troops are the main heroes, we mustn't forget about the support units in our army, who make sure everygriff has ammunition and supplies. To ensure just this, we must reorganise their support battalions into a more effect unit."
 FAT_magic_equip:0 "Utilize the Crystals"
 FAT_magic_equip_desc:0 "Using magical crystals, we are able to create an entirely new kind of gun, one that isn't using ballistic energy but magic instead. Such guns might revolutionise the very nature of warfare. Our lands are rich with the crystals needed to power these weapons, so it would be a waste not to use them effectively."
 FAT_motorized_equip:0 "Mechanise our Army"
 FAT_motorized_equip_desc:0 "While Trucks are an incredibly valuable and effective vehicle to use for transport of troops and supplies, it is also quite evident that they are vulnerable to any sort of incoming fire. Engineers have proposed that we construct an armoured transport vehicle instead, this way our troops can also be transported much closer to the frontline."
 FAT_tanks:0 "An Armoured Spearhead"
 FAT_tanks_desc:0 "Tanks have become one of the most important and powerful assets in modern warfare. Many of our neighbours, like us, have neglected and ignored this fact for the longest time, but no more! Our research and production on this new sort of vehicle shall commence as soon as possible!"
 FAT_pure_infantry_tactics:0 "Pure Infantry Tactics"
 FAT_pure_infantry_tactics_desc:0 "Support equipment and artillery are superflous. Everyone knows the best strategy is simply throwing enough griffons at the enemy until they surrender!"
 FAT_republican_volunteer_corps:0 "Republican Volunteer Corps"

 FAT_propaganda_on_every_corner:0 "Propaganda On Every Corner"

 FAT_declare_national_emergency_desc:0 "The Republic is too unstable in its current state. We must implement measures to make sure that our chaotic nation survives until the Griffonian menace knocks."
 FAT_the_iron_marshal:0 "The Iron Marshal"
 FAT_the_iron_marshal_desc:0 "Our glorious President-Marshal Alexander Kemerskai has declared martial law to stabilize our dying nation, and has expressed his desire to abandon the conquest of Griffonia. Now that stability is assured, our nation can focus on reforming our society, and building a free, independent bastion of order in the North. First, however, we must deal with some "harmonist" traitors."
 FAT_new_dawn_over_cloudbury:0 "Consolidating USRF Rule"
 FAT_new_dawn_over_cloudbury_desc:0 "The forces of the Socialist Republic of Skynavia have taken over the Griffonian Republic. They have liberated our people and freed our peasants and proletariat. We must consolidate our new regime and build a greater Cloudbury, hand-in-hand with the Skynavians."
 FAT_dealing_with_the_republicans:0 "The Fate Of The Republicans"
 FAT_dealing_with_the_republicans_desc:0 "For some reason, Republicans, liberals, and conservatives are unhappy with our socialist government. We need to strike against the Resistance before things get out of hand!"
 FAT_communalist_policies:0 "Reconciliation With Republicans"
 FAT_communalist_policies_desc:0 "Those of the Griffonian Republic have always been open to socialist ideals - and before they suspended the constitution, they even ruled in coalition with the United Socialist Revolutionary Front of Sickleclaw. Most Republicans would be fine working with a socialist government if we give them amnesy and the political rights they once enjoyed."
 FAT_internationalist_policies:0 "Strike Against The Traitors"
 FAT_internationalist_policies_desc:0 "The Republican resistance is dedicated to destroying everything we have built! The rule of the proletariat in poiltics and industry disgust them, as they are only vile oligarchs who seek to return to a time when political power was only in their hands. We must crack down on this resistance and liberate the people from any Republican threat they may face."
 FAT_reconstruction:0 "A New Identity"
 FAT_reconstruction_desc:0 "From now on, the people of the Socialist Republic of Cloudbury will no longer conform to the identity of the Republic. They will stand, free and equal, with their Skynavian comrades, and the natives of Cloudbury will finally be given the righst they deserve."
 FAT_collectivization:0 "Collectivize Northern Farms"
 FAT_collectivization_desc:0 "Even though the Republic claimed to be a government that supported the rights of the proletariat against the oligarchs and nobles, they have failed to do so, and let the warlords in the North control much of the farmland. Now that we have control of this land, we should redistribute and collectivize it."
 FAT_workers_councils:0 "Support The Workers Councils"
 FAT_workers_councils_desc:0 "Workers must organize and stand together as one against the forces of capitalism and reactionary ideology. Workers councils will be formed to allow the proletariat to participate in government directly."
 FAT_go_with_sparrowsbane:0 "Chairgriffon Sparrowsbane"
 FAT_go_with_sparrowsbane_desc:0 "Moe Sparrowsbane is a staunch internationalist and loyalist to Skynavia, being one of the main members in the revolt against the Griffonian Republic. He is dedicated to collectivization, socialism, and the proletariat, although many have criticized his authoritarian measures and willingness to purge dissidents."
 FAT_go_with_astler:0 "Chairgriffon Astler"
 FAT_go_with_astler_desc:0 "A democratic socialist and former stalwart of the Repbulic, many believe that allowing Rikard Astler to become chairgriffon would lessen Republican resistance and increase cooperation with older Republican elements. However, many claim that Astler is not a true socialist and that he would tolerate the forces of capitalism and reactionary ideology in Cloudbury."
 FAT_revise_the_principles:0 "Revise The Three Principles"
 FAT_revise_the_principles_desc:0 "The three principles of the Griffonian Republic were once "Liberty, Democracy, and Prosperity", but Kemerskai never established those principles. We should establish greater versions of these principles, through the light of socialism!"
 FAT_socialist_prosperity:0 "The Principle Of Socialist Prosperity"
 FAT_socialist_prosperity_desc:0 "The first principle of the Republic was Prosperity. Unfortunately, they did not actually grant prosperity to their citizens, only giving them token welfare benefits. We shall not grant workers useless welfare and social benefits - as we shall give them something greater - the means of production themselves!"
 FAT_socialist_liberty:0 "The Principle Of Socialist Liberty"
 FAT_socialist_liberty_desc:0 "The second principle of the Republic was Liberty. According to the Republic, its government had "freedom of speech" and "freedom of association", yet it commenced massive crackdowns on communist groups after the suspension of the constitution. We shall give the workers of the Republic true liberty, under socialism!"
 FAT_socialist_democracy:0 "The Principle Of Socialist Democracy"
 FAT_socialist_democracy_desc:0 "The third principle of the Republic was Democracy. This is perhaps the most outlandish claim of the Republic, as it never truly had democracy. Kemerskai suspended the consitution after the Long March, abolishing free elections for President. Their government also never gave workers democracy and self-management in their factories, something that is crucial to a people's society."
 FAT_state_military_industry:0 "Military Industry Incentives"
 FAT_state_military_industry_desc:0 "If we are to aid our Skynavian liberators in the Great Patriotic War against the Empire, we must build up our military strength and produce more military weapons.

 griffonRepublic.10.d:0 "Reinhard Suntail, a charismatic and vicious veteran, who has been training his forces in the countryside and engaging in banditry, along with Claus Rosewing, one of Kemerskai's major officers in the Revolution, who has been keen to usurp power ever since Kemerskai's revolution failed, have begun to plot against our government. It is unknown what their plans are, but government agents think they oppose the reforming of the military and are plotting a coup to keep their banditry and scandalous military practices intact. Claus Rosewing has been alleged to be part of the Griffonian National Revolutionary Front, an underground nationalist group that opposes both democracy and monarchy, believing a strong, powerful leader can guide the Republic to glory. But if we want to encourage this behavior, maybe we should do nothing..."
 griffonRepublic.10.a:0 "We cannot harm our own citizens."

Many are drawn in by promises of looting and banditry, and are fed up with the consistent low pay from the chaotic government in Cloudbury. This could easily prove problematic for our government, as if Rosewing and Suntail ever revolt against the government, they will have the power of many once-loyalt roops on their side."

This is our last chance to break this rebellion apart, or our Nation could very well fall apart."

 griffonRepublic.13.d:0 "It's too late. The mutineers, deserters and protesters have gathered under the banner and command of our old guard generals. They demand much, but most importantly hate our regime, Republic and our Leader. Our government only controls the area of Cloudbury and the surrounding urban territory, but we will not falter! We will not lose to the traitors! We will preserve the Republic, or die trying. It shouldn't have come to this... but it's time to fight, once again. Time to fight for our liberty!"

 griffonRepublic.18.t:0 "A Meeting With Rosewing"
 griffonRepublic.18.d:0 "General Rosewing is one of the most prominent warlords in the republic. While his troops and mandate are supported by the government itself, he seems to only act more independently of the high command everyday, with his forces even raiding local encampments of troops loyal to us. Today, the Republican army held a meeting with Rosewing, in which he claimed he had nothing to do with the raids, and that his regiments had strict punishments for raiding anyway, so there would be no precedent for raiding in his regime. He blamed the entirety of the problems with the unruly army on Suntail and a few unruly soldiers within his army, saying that he had always been loyal to the republic and he would never do such a thing."
 griffonRepublic.18.a:0 "An interesting conversation."
 
 griffonRepublic.19.t:0 "A Meeting with Suntail"
 griffonRepublic.19.d:0 "General Suntail is an incredibly controversial public figure. At 17, he joined the Republican Army and participated in the revoultion that brought an end to the Griffonian monarchy. As the years have gone on, however, he has become more radical and more disillusioned with the Republican dream. Having a meeting with the most dangerous griffon in Griffonia was no small task, but at the end, Suntail demanded 3 major concessions. His first demand was the legalization of the National Revolutionary Front, an underground ultranationalist organization that was convicted of multiple terrorist attacks in 1003 and subsequently banned. The second demand was the pardoning of all raiders, except the radical ones, which he claimed he would "sort out" on his own. The third demand was millions of idols for his troops to "supply"."
 griffonRepublic.19.a:0 "I don't think we have a choice."
 
 griffonRepublic.199.t:0 "The Generals Submit"
 griffonRepublic.199.d:0 "Rosewing and Suntail have come to the Imperial Capital with their most prominent officers on direct order of President-Marshal Kemerskai. The details of the meeting were completely obscured to the people, but journalists believed it was a discussion to finally end the question of banditry in the countryside. Reporters from the Cloudbury Times claimed they saw "Rosewing and Kemerskai walking out of the Presidential palace, shaking hands and talking vigorously." It appears that Rosewing and Suntail have finally sworn their oaths to the Republic never to undergo banditry again."
 griffonRepublic.199.a:0 "Three cheers for the Republic!"
 
 griffonRepublic.198.t:0 "Successful Apprehension of Rosewing"
 griffonRepublic.198.d:0 "General Rosewing has been arrested, reports that we got from the field are not too clear, but it seems that as soon as our troopers approached his quarters, they were fired on. After a short exchange of fire, that left few of our soldiers wounded and dead, they had managed to storm their defences, and as soon as that has happened, all of Rosewing soldiers, with him included, had mass-capitulated to our forces."
 griffonRepublic.198.a:0  "Let's have a public trial to show what happens to those who defy the Republic."
 
 griffonRepublic.20.t:0 "The Bandit Problem"
 griffonRepublic.20.d:0 "Ever since the establishment of our Republic, bandits, marauders, and other criminals were a true problem for everyone not living in the middle of a big city, many years had passed since, but they had stayed a strong thorn against our government. But that has recently changed, as we now put more of our attention on bringing them down, and we can at least guarantee that major roads and communication paths are safe from them. Yet we cannot stop now, there are still smaller and bigger villages and cities being terrorised by them, and many of smaller roads are still infested with that pest."
 griffonRepublic.20.a:0 "Intensify our efforts, make sure that every road, and every city in the Republic is safe."
 
 griffonRepublic.21.t:0 "Banditry Dealt With"
 griffonRepublic.21.d:0 "Today marks the first day when no city in our Republic, nor a road, is taken over by bandits. Our campaign to eradicate them was hard and bloody, but it has payed off in the end, and most of our citizens can now sleep soundly, as we made sure that remnants of once great gangs, bands, and groups had been driven into hiding. But we cannot make a mistake here, even though they hide in forests, and in less scrupulous parts of our cities, they could still return to their old ways if we won't push them even harder."
 griffonRepublic.21.a:0 "Make sure that army scouts every single Forest or hiding hole in the countryside."
 
 griffonRepublic.22.t:0 "Criminals Purged"
 griffonRepublic.22.d:0 "We just got report in, our armed forces have managed to find and swiftly deliver justice to the last band of 'Priesthood' gang. It's quite an interesting end to our campaign, seeing how 'Priesthood' was the first criminal organisation in the Republic. With their end, an age in the history of our country ends. Where once was lawlessness, now there is order, where once every well meaning griff was afraid to go out at night, now you can meet all kinds of merry griffons celebrating whatever occasion, or just having fun together, where once most of the roads had to be travelled together with armed escort, now you can see lone mothers with children going on about their day, more then sure about their safety."

 griffonRepublic.42.d:0 "Today some truly terrifying reports have reached Cloudbury. It seems that some of smaller villages, and cities are reporting that they aren't getting enough of food delivered to them. It's nothing that surprising considering that our countryside is in chaos, but if we won't be able to fix that, this could lead to some truly worrying consequences."
 griffonRepublic.42.a:0 "Make sure that reports reaching us are true, and this this isn't some overreaction."
 
 griffonRepublic.43.t:0 "The State of the Countryside"
 griffonRepublic.43.d:0 "The Situation in the countryside is bone-chilling, as it seems that previous reports weren't overblown, and were true. What is worse, at this point most of the farmers and places that produce food either keep it for themselves, or sell it privately at greatly inflated prices. And any transports of food are already at great risk of being raided by greedy bandits, or just by starving and desperate griffons. If we wish not to have a catastrophe in our Republic, we should do something."
 griffonRepublic.43.a:0 "Send armed guards together with transports, inspect every mill and every farm for suspicious surplus of food."
 
 griffonRepublic.44.t:0 "Famine Recovery"
 griffonRepublic.44.d:0 "Since the start of our efforts aimed at stopping, and making the famine less deadly, we have managed to help countless griffons, and to keep many more from dying. While situation isn't perfect now, more and more farms and mills are returning to their usual production quotas. But it will still take time before we can safely let things run on their own, especially since there is still few places where hunger is a very real danger to everyone."
 griffonRepublic.44.a:0 "Focus on making everything returning to work as normal."
 
 griffonRepublic.45.t:0 "Famine is Over"
 griffonRepublic.45.d:0 "Today marks the day when the famine has ended, and our food supply is as good as never before. It wasn't easy, and we sadly have to count death in thousands, but this must serve as a warning to us all, that we shouldn't let ever again for such chaos to run wild among in countryside. And as such, our policies of soldiers escorting supply trains, and that of inspections, are here to stay."
 griffonRepublic.45.a:0 "Some small impositions are a small price for keeping everygriff fed."
 
 griffonRepublic.50.t:0 "Vedina Question"
 griffonRepublic.50.d:0 "Vedina is a monarchy, same sort that we had tried to destroy in the year 978, and yet they are probably the only monarchy on the entire Griffonian continent that cares about every single one of their citizens, and where the king acts as an administrator of the realm, and treats every griff with the same rights, no matter if griff is a nobleman, or a commoner. As such, we have to make a hard decision of our policy towards them. We either let monarchy prosper for now, under a wise and caring king, yet risk yet another tyrant rising in the future. But to make sure that won't happen, we also could invade them, and make sure that monarchy will never be a threat to Vedina people, yet it would be such a shame to fight against such a nice King... "
 griffonRepublic.50.a:0 "Until they are just, they are same as us, even if their leader is named a King."
 griffonRepublic.50.b:0 "It is regrettable, but it must be done."
 
 griffonRepublic.51.t:0 "We have been invited to a faction by [FAT.GetName]"
 griffonRepublic.51.d:0 "Today we had been invited to a common faction by [FAT.GetName], they are a republican break-away state from the Griffonian Empire. And they are one of not many nations around us who really gives a damn about the griffons they rule, even if their management isn't the most efficient one. We should take note however, that they are republican to the very depth of their hearts, and as such, if we would refuse, it could anger them into doing something unwise. Yet, at same time, agreeing to getting a common faction with them, while beneficial to common folk, could drag us into a bloody and long war with some of the monarchies around."
 griffonRepublic.51.a:0 "Even if we will fight a war, it is worthy for the Republic."
 griffonRepublic.51.b:0 "We cannot ally with such fanatics as the Republic."
 
 griffonRepublic.52.t:0 "Vedina Agrees!"
 griffonRepublic.52.d:0 "The wise King of Vedina has agreed to an alliance with us, , citing goodness that we can do for common-folk in both of our countries, and how we are the only nations that care for the well being of our citizens."
 griffonRepublic.52.a:0 "A reasonable, freedom loving King? This calls for celebration."
 
 griffonRepublic.53.t:0 "Vedina Refuses"
 griffonRepublic.53.d:0 "As could have been expected, Vedina has disagreed to join our faction, calling us warmongers, and telling us that we would cause thousands of deaths, just for political gains. As always, these are typical monarchist lies, still, it's a bit disappointing that supposedly such a wise and caring king would not agree to join us. But in the end, all monarchies are the same, and this only further proves it."
 griffonRepublic.53.a:0 "Kings will be kings. We will liberate people of Vedina soon enough."
 
 griffonRepublic.54.t:0 "The Bell Tolls For Us"
 griffonRepublic.54.d:0 "After [FAT.GetName] had defeated the Griffonian Empire, and now they are demanding for every state in Griffonia to join their republic. If we would do that, we would have to say goodbye to any of our independence, but otherwise... we might be risking war with The Republic, and that could be very dangerous, or very bloody."
 griffonRepublic.54.a:0 "We have no choice to agree."
 griffonRepublic.54.b:0 "We won't give our independence away to some silly republican pretenders."
 
 griffonRepublic.55.t:0 "Pretender State Agrees on Integration"
 griffonRepublic.55.d:0 "One of the many pretender-state that was born out of the ineptness of the empire has agreed to join us as a republic member state, we give them right to limited autonomy, and having their own elected leaders, but they are our allies and stand together with us when it comes to: Foreign Policy, Military, Science, and Economy. "
 griffonRepublic.55.a:0 "Very good, one potential tyrannical dictatorship less."
 
 griffonRepublic.56.t:0 "Pretender State Refuses Integration"
 griffonRepublic.56.d:0 "One of the pretender-state that has stood with us refuses to bend their knees to us, if we wish to keep our reputation as a major country, and strong player in region, we shouldn't let that go unpunished. "
 griffonRepublic.56.a:0 "Banish them from our faction, they better be glad, we haven't decided to punish them more."
 griffonRepublic.56.b:0 "We need them, for now, but we shall remember this, but as soon as we don't..."

 griffonRepublic.60.t:0 "The Invention of Beaklle"
 griffonRepublic.60.d:0 "From a rundown suburb of our fair capital comes an invention which will change the lives of many. A simple school griffon has come up with a completely new way of writing down griffonian using new methods of printing. The method involves printing repeating patterns of dots onto paper, yet these dots do not use any ink at all. The new printer pushes small bumps into the paper. What use is this? Well, up until now the blind have been unable to read. Yet the inventor, who is blind himself, professes this new technique allows blind griffons to read. The invention has taken the education establishment by storm and two different schools for the blind have just opened in our capital."
 griffonRepublic.60.a:0 "The blind can read. Good for them!"

 griffonRepublic.61.t:0 "It comes from the lake"
 griffonRepublic.61.d:0 "Reports have come in of a strange sighting from Lake Fenfir. Apparently a group of local youths were having a party at the edge of the lake when a black figure rose from the depths of the waters. They allege to have been attacked, and while authorities have officially disregarded the incident as just some teenagers experimenting with hallucinogens, sightings of the creature have increased. In fact, it's become a bit of a tourist attraction. Any concrete evidence of the creature's existence however has not been found."
 griffonRepublic.61.a:0 "Someone will make money out of this."

 griffonRepublic.62.t:0 "The Perfeatherain Affair"
 griffonRepublic.62.d:0 "Scandal shook the parliament today as it was heard that the secretary of defence, Jaxon Perfeatherain, was involved in an affair with a prostitute. If this wasn't embarrassing enough, the prostitute in question, Cataleene Chickela was reportedly also sleeping with another griffon who just so happens to be a known spy for the Communist Revolution Front! Fears that state secrets may have been revealed to Ms Chickela and then passed on through pillow talk have resulted in calls for the defence secretary to resign, pending further inquiry of ill conduct. Jaxon Perfeatherain denies any claims of ill conduct, but has tendered his resignation to the president. In his leaving speech from the senate, he regretted the loss of confidence in him and spoke of a desire to spend more time with family."
 griffonRepublic.62.a:0 "How embarrassing!"

 griffonRepublic.63.t:0 "Only 500 Homes?"
 griffonRepublic.63.d:0 "This week has been marred with controversy as Secretary of Housing Tarold Wingwillian made a spectacular blunder in his address to the senate. Somehow his personal assistant had mistyped his speech and missed two entire zeros on the end of a number. Thus, instead of winning national support for our new housing project to build fifty thousand homes, the government has been belittled and ridiculed for pledging only to build five hundred homes. Worse, the Secretary of Housing did not notice the mistake and was thoroughly quizzed on it by the opposition."
 griffonRepublic.63.a:0 "Get your act together, man!"

 griffonRepublic.64.t:0 "The GRS Imperative"
 griffonRepublic.64.d:0 "One of our newest destroyer models has yesterday gone missing after failing to report in while on manoeuvres. After realising the destroyer was lost, our naval group was scrambled to search for the vessel. After a full twelve hours of fruitless searching, the destroyer appeared again, gliding out of thick fog. It was first thought the report was a fake as the position of the destroyer was well out of the area that it could have possibly travelled in that time, yet there it was. Even stranger, it was discovered afterwards that the destroyer was completely unmanned on arrival. The entire crew has been reported missing and the ship has been quarantined for further scientific and magical analysis."
 griffonRepublic.64.a:0 "It's a ghost ship you say?"

 griffonRepublic.65.t:0 "The Puritan Liberation Movement"
 griffonRepublic.65.d:0 "A counter culture has been gaining momentum today, opposed to radical changes in our very society. The Puritan Liberation Movement, as they style themselves, advocates that modern society is too lax about more adult subjects such as sex and relationships. Specifically, they are very concerned about the effect that profanity and violence could be having on the younger generations and advocate for some government controls and censorship of the media to protect those who are more sensitive. Their claims are being investigated by the media regulators, but intervention by central government is not planned as of yet."

Should we reform our administration? There are many questions that must not be tackled."

 griffonRepublic.207.d:0 "We have taken Greifenheim, and the Republic is finally ready to embrace the Three Principles it was founded on. Security, Nationalism, and Prosperity. Reinhard Suntail has announced that the Nation could finally move on to embracing the revolutionary principles of its founding. However, Suntail's three principles were different from Kemerskai's - Suntail took Kemerskai's principle of liberty and replaced it with his own principle of security, meaning that the nation must be protected from both within and without, and the people must sacrifice their freedoms for the good of the state. Kemerksai's second principle - Democracy, was replaced with Nationalism, the belief that the revolution must encompass all Griffons, and that the Republic should embody a patriotic, ultranationalist movement. The crowds still cheered for Suntail's reforms, but they were cheering for an amalgamation of the original three principles. Suntail claims the original three principles were, "outdated for a modern regime", and that they "died when the revolution failed so many years ago"."

Astler is content to develop a isolationist Republic that emphasizes the values of socialism and local democracy.

Those are the three principles that he founded, and those are the three principles that we will never withdraw. Liberty - the right to the pursuit of freedom, Democracy - the right to vote in free and fair elections, and Prosperity - the right to a home, a wage, and food. No griffon will lie starving or in poverty! We will not fall to the evils of authoritarian socialism, the siren song of "democratic" socialism, or the insidious killer that is fascism. We will stand, a vanguard of democracy, and unite the people under our rule."\n\n Sunglider bean to tear up. He had never thought of reaching this moment - the moment where the republic stood over Griffenheim, and he was just about to lead the revolution in the place of his greatest idol. His voice trembling, he uttered "I swear to protect the three values of the Republic, to never betray them, and to stand as commander in chief and commander of the military of this nation. I willl uphold the constitution, and uphold the values of Kemerskai, the first president of the Republic."

Posters and flyers with socialist and republican messages dotted the crowd, and griffons raised their claws to salute their new president.\n\n"I will never give the Griffonian people up!," he yelled. Another cheer from the crowd. "I will never let the Griffonian people down!" More cheers. "I will never desert the Griffonian people in their time of need," he spoke clearly, his voice booming above the ravenous crowd, "I will end the culture of young griffons coming home to their families in tears, losing their jobs! I will never make them cry!" The generals surrounding him began to smile, their stern gazes warming into geniune support for the new President. "Most importantly, I will never say goodbye to my base of support, I will never tell them lies about our nation and policies, and I will never hurt them like the bandit lords of old did. I will never give you up!"\n\n Astler shook hands with the generals, and with his vice president, Albert Collenich, and then swore upon the texts of the Griffonian gods to uphold the Republican constitution.

With almost 20 years of banditry, chaos, and political instability due to Kemerskai's suspension of the 978 Constitution in 986, opposition forces have risen considerably in power, especially socialists.\n\nOne such opposition politican, Rikard Astler, has rallied the left behind a new wing of the NRP, one that is socialist but still represents bourgouise democracy, unlike the systems of Skynavia or Prywhen. Astler's democratic socialist ideals have quickly gained support, and many no longer trust Kemerskai's regime to actually bring Republicanism to the people.\n\nSocialist councillors have begun a plan to rally the people behind their ideals, and wish for an eventual vote of no confidence against Kemerskai's regime. Many believe that this would result in an openly socialist President-Marshal, and maybe even the destruction of martial law, under a politican like Rikard Astler."

 griffonRepublic.203.d:0 "The military council that was formed by the National Republican Army in 1008 to counter the regime of Kemerskai has fallen apart, and those loyal to Rosewing and Suntail have begun to create paramilitary and political groups to counter the influence of the other. Brawls in the streets are common between Sutail's Blackshirts and Rosewing's Bandits and Raiders. Supporters of Rosewing advocate for a military dictatorship that asserts its influence through raiding of other countries for guns, food, and supplies, like the Sunstriker Clan founded by Eriviar Sunstriker. This bandit dictatorship, supporters claim, will bring about stability and an end to poverty, as resources will simply be swiped from other countries. Suntail is perhaps the more dangerous one. His supporters, nicknamed the Blackshirts but formally known as the National Revolutionary Front, want to establish a Griffonian Republic, take Griffenheim, and destroy the old vestiges of monarchy. But instead of a democratic regiem like Kemerskai, they want to establish a despotic regime, in which the oligarhcs are thrown out of their windows and wealth is given to the people, as long as they serve the state. Suntail's ultranationalist and populist ideology may prove a danger to Rosewing's dictatorship, and it is beginning to attract the lower classes. But can Rosewing use his veteranship and political connections among the elite to secure power?"

At approximately 2:00 in the morning, Suntail's troops marched into the offices of Claus Rosewing, unleashing a hail of machine gun fire on him and his bodyguards. An hour later, popular militas and Suntail's blackshirts marched on the military council, demanding the council surrender complete power to Suntail. The council conceded, and swore Suntail in as President and Supreme Leader of the Griffonian Republic. Suntail's policy is radical and dangerous. He supports a return to the Imperial dialect, and he views the language of the native Griffons and Ponies as barbaric. He supports full total mobilization and a lightning war against the Griffonian Empire, which will leave the nation in ashes. From this, he will begin to implement ultranationalist policies as the new leader of the Empire, and conquer all of Griffonia under the new order. His plans are radical, but we have faith that Suntail will be able to secure victory in these troubled times."

Reinhard Suntail has been arrested for plotting to overthrow the military government, and General Claus Rosewing has assumed his position as President of the Griffonian National Republic, along with a position as Commander-in-Chief of the Griffonian armed forces. Rosewing's politics differ from the radical Suntail. He does not support the expansionist policies of Suntail, supporting instead isolationist policies. He has relinquished claims to Griffenheim, for example, and has announced that he will not pursue any large-scale wars against Vedina or the Empire. Rosewing's economic policy is mostly based on the economics of war, like the raider economy of the Sunstriker clan. He is also associated with the old guard of the military, and dislikes both ultranationalism and socialism, claiming they are "collectivist", "populist", ideologies, that "redistribute wealth based on false principles to strengthen the tyranny of the majority"."

Some were assassinated in their homes, and others were imprisoned and sentenced to the firing squad. Generals who had previously supported the revolution against Kemerskai now found themselves in a jail cell by the very person they had once fought for. Suntail held a speech in Cloudbury, where he claimed that the killings were "necessary for the stability for the republic," and that they would allow him to bring about "a republic for the people, not ruled by vicious oligarchs and foolhardy harmonists.""

Suntail's troops have caused thousands of casualties in their bloodthirsty attempts to rid the countryside of bandits, and Rosewing has been accussed of looting Republic towns and villages for supplies for his army. This behavior is unnaceptable, and must be stopped. However, there are two solutions to such a thing. Schnabel Sungider, a political idealist and one of Kemerskai's closest advisors, says that the military should be rebuilt and the rebellious commanders sacked, so that the military will be at the same standard of the Griffonian army. Heinrich Kingfeather, ever the pragmatist, has dismissed this, claiming that the best course of action is the swiftest, merely placating the generals and going on with the Republican regime like clockwork."

The celebration was complete with a professional band lended from Skyfall for an obscene price, its members sporting fancier suits than the Duke himself. When he reached the parliamentary building, a 21-gun salute was given by the military of the Duchy of Cloudbury.\n\n However, in the homes of most citizens, the atmosphere was very different. The people of the Republic showed disbelief and skepticism. Years after the revolution had been brought north, and Duke Otto Plumenjar was lynched along with his wife Freja, the monarchy was being restored again. Trumpets blared and griffon soldiers paraded across the streets, but there was only a small amount of applause from the crowd, and even those who applauded cared little for the new monarchy. It would take time for the people to grow accustomed to this new regime, a regime that seemed to defy everything the Republic was built on.\n\nIn a speech to the local populace, Duke Oskar emphasized the need to "bring back the idea of a monarchy into the hearts and minds of these corrupted Griffons", and claimed that "the Republican Revolution was the greatest disaster to ever behold Griffonia, and left this land in complete anarchy. It was no doubt the gravest event in the last century." Republican leader Heinrich Kingfeather, in exile in the Kingdom of Vedina, wrote Oskar a strongly worded letter, telling him to "get his inbred group of goats out of this nation before the people lynch you like they did your bastard father"."

Due to the actions of Kemerskai, however, our social instability has been mended, our banditry problem has been eradicated, and our soldiers are beginning to have faith in the Republican dream again.\n\n But the question arises, should we pursue the dream and reclaim Griffenheim? Or should we bide our time and take up a defensive position against the Empire, and avoid the failures of the revolution of 978?"

Civilian movement will be strictly controlled, the sale of firearms is banned, and the parliament is temporarily suspended. In a radio adress to the people, Kemerskai emphasized that the nation would return to civilian rule after the Imperial threat was contained, but also claimed he would not attack the Empire directly, saying that would be "suicide". Given that Kemerskai's emergency both lasts until the Imperial threat is contained but also given that he does not plan to attack the Imperials directly, it appears that the emergency will be almost indefinite."

Today, in Cloudbury, in the seat of the nation where I once announced the birth of a new nation after the long march, I now announce the death of the foolish title of the "Griffonian Republic"."\n\n The crowd was in disbelief. Silently, they stared at Kemerskai. "This nation will become the Republic of Cloudbury, ruled over by the safe and benevolent hand of Marshal Alexander Kemerskai. No longer will we throw troops into wars of agression for the Republican dream. There will be no more deaths! No more suffering! We will be united under the banner of Cloudbury!"\n\nKemerskai walked off the stage, but there was no applause.

The second president of the Griffonian Republic had Otto Gremmersen, his most trusted general, bring the imprisoned Grover VI to the center of the capital, right outside the former Imperial palace, which had been converted into a homeless shelter by Astler. Grover VI, at this point a teenager, understood the reason his generals were bringing him to the center, and did not resist, hanging his head low as he was brought to the center and executed.\n\nThe Griffonian monarchy is finally dead, and the Republic has now asserted its supreme authority upon Griffenheim."

Along with Kogchel, Astler shook hands with the Republican and Anarchist opposition in Angriver, claiming he has "united the fractured Angriverian left for the first time in history", although many have doubted the posibility of allying conservatives with anarchists. Kogchel and Astler also made alliances with Erich Mühschnabel and Cyrusval university, a radical but quite "armchair" group of socialists. It is unknown if this rag-tag group of moderates, democrats, anti-statists and theorists will ever stand together long enough to gain political power, but at least it is a step in the right direction to uniting the left."

Each worker will be entitled to land, so that there is no boss overhead to opress them in a system of wage slavery. Each worker is entitled to bread, so that they can feed their family, and work without fear of starvation and death. In addition to the principles of liberty, democracy, and prosperity, these three priciples of socialism will also guide us to a greater future."

 griffonRepublic.217.d:0 "In a radio adress heard by millions across the nation, President Schnabel Sunglider announced his new plan for the nation - harmony with republican characterists. In his adress, Sunglider viciously mocked the Equestrian monarchy for its autocratic nature, where two ponies ruled over all of Equestria, and were seen as gods. He then compared this to the system of divine right which the Griffonian Empire used to justify its legitimacy. In Sunglider's eyes, these two monarchies were one and the same - they were both despotic empires that used religious undertones to convince the people into supporting them.\n\nSunglider's new plan, harmony with republican characteristics, would solve this by implementing "true democracy". The constitution would guarantee the right to both free national elections and decentralized local elections, in which Griffons would be able to influence local policy. Direct rule from Canterlot, he said, is a foolish system, and true harmony needs a decentralized state tailored to different regions. Policy from Angriver to Skynavia would be much different, and local representatives would have significant sway on the government. This decentralized, democratic harmony will surely form the new basis of Sunglider's presiential platform."

 griffonRepublic.218.t:0 "Prosperity For The Griffons"
 griffonRepublic.218.d:0 "The third but arguably the most important Republican principle is prosperity. The principle of prosperity states that no griffon will be left to the dogs or oppressed by feudal masters at work - every griffon is entitled to a home, a living wage, and a life free from servitude. Any griffon should be able to start their own business and achieve their own dream, but in recent years, this has been solely lacking, and poverty has only increased. To rectify this, we must continue welfare programs and tax cuts on former Griffonian peasants, ensuring them a living wage and a life free from the poverty the Imperials imposed on them. To pay for these ambitious new social programs, we will hike taxes on the former nobles of the lands, and conduct land reform and even seizure on underworked lands controlled by Griffonian oligarchs. Only then can we liberate our people, and truly achieve prosperity for all griffons."

But with the Republic in control of Griffenheim, NRP divides have only strengthened. Socialists believe that the NRP's principle of prosperity is incompatible with the conservative wing of the party, while the conservatives believe the socialists are undermining the principle of liberty with their anti-free market stance. With harmonists and democrats mostly in the middle, they have tried hard to mend the divide and assure both sides that the values of the Republic are being protected, but to no avail. Sometimes, parliament members even brawled with their fellow partymen due to conflicts in economic stances! With the climate growing more polarized by the day, we risk a splinter wing forming off the NRP, and undermining our legitimacy. Some griffons claim that it is necessary to favor one wing and let the other go to stabilize the party, but others claim it is imperative that the party is unified, whatever the cost may be."

He has seen the death of his comrades, the lie of "peaceful harmony". "Peaceful harmony" has only given Sunglider the glory of seeing monarchist boots trample over his comrades, his friends. No. He will not stand and watch as dictatorships still rule in Griffonia. Now that he has the resources to attack the monarchies of the land, he will do so, and the brave Republican people will march on in pursuit of the three principles. Harmony will reign in Griffonia, and Kemerskai's dream will live on, through a united, Pan-Griffon state.

Within our nation, socialists strike at our decade-old democracy, disregarding the principle of liberty with their beliefs in broad nationalizations and destruction of our free market, capitalist system. Their policies would no doubt collapse our economy and weaken our democracy, allowing their smily, charismatic leaders to sully our Republic and abolish republican rule under the false pretense of "restoring order".

One of Kemerskai's major goals was to create a Griffonian welfare state, that would care for all griffons and guarantee them a home, food, and family. However, conservative economists in the government of Heinrich Kingfeather predict that our nation will fall into economic collapse with too much welfare spending, and that interest rates on Griffonian currency across the nation will spike! We cannot have this, and must roll back welfare reforms, instead relying on the meritocratic forces on the free market, which would ensure that griffons all had a chance to achieve as much wealth as possible. There will be no more burdensome regulations on the people of the Republic, nor welfare programs that condemn griffons to lives of decadence as they scrounge off government benefits. No!

This faction, after finding themselves independent from the most powerful political party in all of Griffonia, initially splintered into many different warring factions. Eventually, days later, Rikard Astler formed the Socialist Party of Griffonia, uniting syndicalists, democratic socialists, and even disaffected social democrats in a large, big-tent, socialist party. With socialists purged from the party, the NRP has shifted to the right, and it will be much easier for us to pass our capitalist reforms. With a legal opposition, we can also begin further democratization of the Republic. The creation of a socialist opposition will be a stepping stone to the eventual building of a multi-party system."

 griffonRepublic.224.d:0 "In a stunning move by President Heinrich Kingfeather, the local governments of the Heartlands have had significant power taken from them. Before the centralization measures, the parliaments of the Hearlands had striking amounts of power, and were delegated large amounts of autonomy. Parliaments in Angriver, the remnants of war-torn Katerin, and Feathisia, due to the large amount of Republicanism in those areas, were able to influence policy in their provinces, and often overruled federal projects and plans for the area. Our government in Griffenheim had to go through so much bureaucracy of local parliaments that we could not even get a simple public works project through the Feathisian government. Thankfully, Kingfeather has reformed these archaic institutions, and weakened these parliaments so they will no longer be a thorn in the side of the Griffenheim government.

He advocates for major welfare reforms, expansion of cooperatives, and industrial democracy. His life in the Grand Duchy of Feathisia has given him a major devotion to democratic values, and he has disavowed many of his connections with anarchists and revolutionary socialists.\n\nThe second candidate is Genevieve Guildedwing, a Skyfall-based social democrat and populist. Her experiences with the unregulated capitalism of Skyfall's oligarchy will make her a candidate who understands the plight of the common folk. She will no doubt establish progressive taxes and transform the Republic into a welfare state.\n\nThe third candidate is Theodore Verany, a griffon very similar to the President-Marshal. An Aquiliean revolutionary who fought in multiple revolutions against the corrupt Discret dynasty, Verany is dedicated to the principles of republicanism and harmony. Verany is beloved by republicans ascross Griffonia, and he is an effective, unifying, candidate. \n\nThe forth candidate is Gallo Ventriglio, a Wingbardian liberal and capitalist, who is a major proponent of laissez-faire economics and friendship with Equestria. Gallo dislikes socialist and statist economics, and prefers a free market economy. Gallo is a staunch democrat, but he is not necessarily a staunch republican.\n\nThe final candidate, and the most loyal to the beliefs of the NRP, is Kemerskai's own son, Alexander Kemerskai Jr., a staunch Republican. Alexander supports centralizing the Republic, strengthening the positions of the president, and making sure that the government is efficient and populist. Opponents say his government would be dictatorial, though he laughs off those accusations."

However, with this new move, our generals are sure that the Republicans will no longer be a threat to the Duchy of Cloudbury.\n\nGenerals loyal to Kemerskai such as Schnabel Sunglider were offered safe immigration back to Cloudbury, although whether they will continue to serve in the army has not been decided yet. In addition, parliamentarians such as Heinrich Kingfeather and Tobias Sivenhof, conservative and centrist members of the NRP, were also given free immigration back to the Republic, and they will be allowed to participate in upcoming parliamentary elections, which will be held "in the future", according to the Duke.

As chairgriffon, he would surely institute policies of militarization and crackdowns on the Republican resistance. Believing the Republicans to be reactionaries after their abolishment of the constitution and distance from their socialist allies, Sparrowsbane is not afraid to get his hands dirty with the Republicans.\n\nSparrowsbane and Astler have different polcies, but both are committed to the Skynavian cause and socialism, and both are a safe choice for our influence in the region."

I wish I could shed a tear, my brothers, but the truth is, Grover V has done nothing for the Heartlands but drive it into doom and despair. I'm sure many of you would agree that Grover V has done almost nothing right - he has let Katerin burn, strengthened the powers of the Archon, centralizing religious control over the capital and ending any hope of a secular Griffonia. He has spit in the face of every constitutional reform that he has been offered, even with the threat of a Second Griffonian Revolution on his doorstep.\n\nHe has lost the Eastern marches, leading them to continue their genocidal crusades on the ponies, and lost the Duchy of Griffonstone to a weak Regency Council under a griffon so old he is called "Grandpa"! He didn't even die right! He left the Empire in such chaos I'm almost inclined to cheer at his death. His son is not even six years old, and it is likely that a regency council of nobles, oligarchic and corrupt, will rule in his stead.\n\nAs much as it pains to say it, this is a victory for the Republic.

When Kemerskai joined the army, they developed a fast friendship, and began to discuss Republican and harmonic ideals. Rosewing, ever the pragmatist, disagreed with the regime of Grover V moreso than the concept of monarchy. He believed that in the right situation, a monarchy could possibly be reformed to suit harmonic ideals. They marched together on the Imperial Palace, and when Kemerskai assumed power, he appointed Rosewing as his second-in-command.\n\nRosewing eventually fled north with Kemerskai, and the two suffered many disagreements about Republican rhetoric and ideals, including Rosewing's sympathy for monarchy, leading Rosewing to be cast out as head general in favor of the ambitious Reinhard Suntail, who had ties to outright fascist groups. Rosewing, disilluisoned, took his army brigades and went North.\n\nEventually, Reinhard Suntail joined him, in an alliance of pure chance against the regime of Kemerskai. Rosewing's doubts about the Republican ideal manifested into full hatred, and he eventually abandoned the ideals of harmony altogether, idolizing military dictatorships and bandit states. Rosewing, however, never stooped to the level of Suntail's raiders, and always distributed raided wealth among his troops. He preffered to raid armories, and warned his soldiers against attacking towns, pronouncing the death penalty for any Republican officer who would do such a thing.

 FAT_political_pragmatist_desc:0 "Heinrich Kingfeather was born a Griffonian noble, but he cast off the title when the Revolution was brought to Griffenheim, prefering to side with the Republicans instead of the corrupt, oligarchic monarchists he had fought against. Though he lived a life of luxury, he quickly abandoned it, and participated in the burning of his own home by the National Republican Army. Kingfeather became a prominent Republican politician, serving as the senator of Cavegrove and becoming a close ally of Kemerskai. His pacifist stance was in sharp contrast to many of the revolutionaries, who believed in direct action against the Griffonian monarchy. Kingfeather began to advocate for more conservative economic policies, such as cutting of welfare but also cutting of the massive military spending budget. Kingfeather became known as "the pragmatist" for his defensive and balanced policies, though he has been attacked by both Harmonists and the working class, who still view him as an oligarch and distrust his policies. However, none can doubt his committment to the Republican dream.
 FAT_political_idealist:0 "Schnabel Sunglider"
 FAT_political_idealist_desc:0 "Schnabel Sunglider is the leader of the Harmonist NRP Faction, and a staunch believer in both the Republican Dream and Pan-Griffonianism. He was born in a slum in Feathisia, he joined the Griffonian military merely to stay alive, and earn enough money to feed himself. While in the military, he joined the brigade of Artillerieoffizier Alexander Kemerskai, and he learned about harmony and republicanism. Immediately, he was drawn to the ideology, and began to delve into books about Equestria and Sicameon. Sunglider participated in the revolution, and served with honor and distinction in the National Republican Army. When he came to the north, he became active in politics, demanding a return to Griffenheim and the restoration of the supsended constiution. He became senator of Cloudbury, and then founded his own faction in the NRP - the Harmonist Caucus. With an almost fanatical devotion to the republic and harmony, Sunglider is an idealist and a militarist, things that make him one of the most dangerous griffons in Cloudbury."

Silverclaw has offered his services to President Heinrich Kingfeather, who had signed a decree pardoning imperial oligarchs. Silverclaw's talents will no doubt prove vital in technological and societal progress in the years to come."

### Leader Descriptions ###

chadskai_desc:0 "Former Artillerieoffizier in the Imperial Army, Marshal Kemerskai was set to have a promising career in the armed forces. But fate had different ideas for Griffonia.\n\nThe tumultuous years that preceded 978 have disillusioned Kemerskai of his loyalty to the Emperor. He could not stand seeing the decadent nobility leech of others' hard work, nor did he approve of the awful conditions the commonfolk were subjected towards. Thus, he began plotting with like-minded officers and made use of the brewing peasants' insurrection. After a particularly crass display of authority abuse from the Regency Council, the people had enough and stormed the Imperial Palace. In the confusion that followed, Kemerskai found his way as the leader of the newly proclaimed Griffonian Republic.\n\nBut this success was not meant to last. Although Kemerskai was popular and commanded respect, he could not control everygriff, and ruling the already weakened country became impossible. It did not take long for a reactionary movement to rise up and banish the republican supporters from the Heartlands. The long march began towards the northern reaches of the fractured Empire, where they have taken control of the region from nobles attempting to start their own independent nation.\n\nMany years have passed since those events, and yet Marshal Kemerskai's devotion to the republican cause has not wavered. Although even now he has to deal with unruly subordinates, he still holds all the cards in his claws. He is also a prolific author, and his many writings inspire republican movements across the entire Griffonia to follow his cause."
suntail_desc:0 "Reinhard Suntail was born in Crona, a province in the heart of the Griffonian Empire. His family was poor, and lived on scraps. Suntail, wanting to escape the dreary farmlands of Crona, joined the Imperial Army at the age of 15, and journeyed to the city of Griffenheim, where he was placed into the brigade of Alexander Kemerskkai, a renowned Artillerieoffizier in the Griffonian Empire and one of Grover's most promising generals.\n\nSuntail joined Kemerskai's plot to overthrow the empire, believing the monarchy of Griffonia was decadent, oligarchic, and drew upon the worst conditions of Griffonkind - greed and lust for power. Suntail participated in the battle for the Imperial Palace, and eventually found his way in command of an entire Republican batallion. With it, he went to his old hometown of Crona and engaged in a brutal looting campaign in an event which would be recalled as "The Rape of Crona" years later.\n\nWhen the revoultionaries began the long march north, Suntail began to doubt the harmonist values that Kemerskai was so dedicated to, and joined a new party - The Griffonian National Revolutionary Front, an ultranationalist organization dedicated to populism, republicanism, and fanatic devotion to the nation state and people. While Kemerskai did not trust Suntail, he was forced to make him the second most powerful griffon in the republic, and he became Kemerskai's top general.\n\nWhen the National Revolutionary Front was banned after a terrorist attack in Cloudbury in 1003, Suntail sent his army North, and began to loot, plunder, and sack both Republican and foreign strongholds for weapons and loot. He became a vicious bandit warlord, known for his sheer brutality against both harmonist and monarchist insitutions."
rosewing_desc:0 "Claus Rosewing was once Kemerskai's most trusted friend in the battle against the Griffonian monarchy. Rosewing was born in 941 in the city of Griffing, Angriver, perhaps the most backward imperial province. From an early age, he witnessed the poverty common in that area of the Empire, and wondered why it occured.\n\n At the age of 24, he joined the Imperial Army, a couple years before Alexander Kemerskai. When Kemerskai joined the army, they developed a fast friendship, and began to discuss Republican and harmonic ideals. Rosewing, ever the pragmatist, disagreed with the regime of Grover V moreso than the concept of monarchy. He believed that in the right situation, a monarchy could possibly be reformed to suit harmonic ideals. They marched together on the Imperial Palace, and when Kemerskai assumed power, he appointed Rosewing as his second-in-command.\n\nRosewing eventually fled north with Kemerskai, and the two suffered many disagreements about Republican rhetoric and ideals, including Rosewing's sympathy for monarchy, leading Rosewing to be cast out as head general in favor of the ambitious Reinhard Suntail, who had ties to outright fascist groups. Rosewing, disilluisoned, took his army brigades and went North.\n\nEventually, Reinhard Suntail joined him, in an alliance of pure chance against the regime of Kemerskai. Rosewing's doubts about the Republican ideal manifested into full hatred, and he eventually abandoned the ideals of harmony altogether, idolizing military dictatorships and bandit states. Rosewing, however, never stooped to the level of Suntail's raiders, and always distributed raided wealth among his troops. He preffered to raid armories, and warned his soldiers against attacking towns, pronouncing the death penalty for any Republican officer who would do such a thing. Rosewing's style of banditry became popular among his soldiers, but whenever he looted the lands he once fought for, he turned sour, and he always thought back to the times he spent with Kemerskai."
oskar_desc:0 "Oskar Plumenjar was never supposed to be duke of Cloudbury. Oskar was born to a commoner, August Plumenjar, in 956 ALB. When Kemerskai's revolution was brought north, and his distant relative, Otto II was executed by Kemerskai, the rest of the legitimate Plumenjar line was taken captive and eventually killed.\n\nWhile this prevented a takeover from monarchist forces, there were still Plumenjars who were alive. In 776 ALB, the infant Erik Plumenjar was betrayed by his great-uncle and regent Frederik, who took the throne for himself and disinherited Erik and any of his future offspring. Erik's line was legitimatized to save the House of Plumenjar, and August begame the leader of the house. August and Oskar, living in the Northern Tribes, a pony community north of Cloudbury, plotted a return to the throne of the Duchy./n/nWhen August died in 1002 ALB, Oskar became head of the house. He is a quiet, well-mannered griffon, who was until now not interested in pursuing his claim. Oskar preffered to live a peaceful life in the Northern Tribes, developing friendships with the local ponies there and becoming officially bilingual.\n\nJust now, however, Oskar was restored to the throne by warlord Claus Rosewing, who declared him Oskar I of the Duchy of Cloudbury. The line of Plumenjar would continue, and Cloudbury would once again stand under monarchic rule!"
