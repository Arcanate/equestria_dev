 EAW_WS_VED:0 "[Root.GetNameDef] - Chivalry is all"
 EAW_WS_VED_desc:0 "The ever independent §YKingdom of Vedina§! stands as a beacon of hope in these troubled times. Their knights fly forth with elegant pagentry and noble purpose. This is a land of Chivalry and of Honour. Glory to a noble of Vedina always comes second to doing the right thing. Good deeds and a warm national spirit are commonplace. Seemingly both stable, and powerful, the mighty Kingdom of the North appears to stand strong and tall among its neighbours. However appearances can be decieving.\n\nVedinan independence has always been a sore issue in the §RGriffonian Empire§! since the very first Vedinan king was granted the §YGodsword of Broturius§! by the witch §YSjönavdam§!. Said to grant the wielder invincibility. For a long time Vedina remained independent, but after a prolonged period of imperial dominance, Vedina was eventually made into a nominal vassal of the Griffonian Empire.\n\nWith the sundering of the empire however, the Kingdom of Vedina has been reborn under §GKing Wingstrom§!. He has led Vedina for many years, reforging its culture of chivalry and nobility from the ground up. He is very popular and very well liked, however there is one key problem. Wingstrom's late wife only left him a daughter, and the old laws of Vedina which Wingstrom himself has reinstated specifies quite clearly that a female cannot rule in Vedina.\n\nNow Wingstrom must fight against the very traditions he has brought back to life. After all, every rule has a loophole. It is stated that any Vedinan knight can prove themselves worthy by completing three great quests. A quest to prove their prowess in battle and their heroism, a quest to prove they can further the family bloodline, and a quest to prove that they can rule and govern a nation. Can Wingstrom's daughter, §GPrincess Sköldsvärd§!, become the rightful heir to the throne and complete all three of these noble quests? Or will Vedina's proud traditions fall under their own hubris?"

Three stand out though.\n\nPrince Stridante, a griffon the picture of Vedinan nobility and dressed in a striking military uniform.\n\nPrince Ondska, a dark-feathered griffon in a red cape. It's his almost... leering smirk that Sköldsvärd recalls the most.\n\nAnd of course, Prince Lycklig. Or... Princess Lycklig. The only female griffon to approach her. \n\nSköldsvärd suspects that these three will be the ones that will ask for her claw in matrimony."
 vedina.3.a:0 "Let's see if Sköldsvärd is right."
 vedina.4.t:0 "Prince Stridante Announces His Intentions to Court Sköldsvärd"
 vedina.4.d:0 "To Princess Sköldsvärd, Stridante's letter is flowery, courteous and quite long. It is honestly a bit of a chore to read. On the other claw, towards the end of the letter, she notices that Stridante underlines a number of concerns about Vedina's military and some rather good ideas about how to improve it. It's a rather odd shift of tone for some griffon that seems to be a pure toff."
 vedina.4.a:0 "Maybe he has hidden depths?"
 vedina.5.t:0 "Prince Ondska Announces His Intentions to Court Sköldsvärd"
 vedina.5.d:0 "Ondska’s letter compliments Sköldsvärd’s beauty, intellect and strength, which is flattering, but rather forward. He has also included a picture in his letter, which shows a dark-feathered griffon in a dashing blue-red jacket. He remarks on how “together, we the strong can achieve anything”. He also mentions though, that “those who oppose us, will simply have to fall in line” and that “change is coming to Vedina.” "
 vedina.5.a:0 "What kind of change? And what does he mean by “fall in line?”"
 vedina.6.t:0 "Princess Lycklig Announces Her Intentions to Court Sköldsvärd"
 vedina.6.d:0 "Sköldsvärd finds Lycklig’s letter the strangest to read, and not simply because it’s a female griffon asking for her claw in courtship. On one claw, Lycklig seems to understand the weight on Sköldsvärd’s shoulders, saying that if she becomes her consort, she’ll do her best to “shoulder her responsibilities, and make you happy”. But there’s very little about why she would be the best consort, especially given that she is well, a she."
 vedina.6.a:0 "A bit of a mystery."
 vedina.7.t:0 "First Day at Court: A Summary"
 vedina.7.d:0 "Today, not one, but three princes (among them a princess) have announced that they wish to court Sköldsvärd. Somehow she must now choose between the three of them. Luckily, as is the custom the Princess must participate in some group event with her courtiers. She can get to know her suitors better during that time."
 vedina.7.a:0 "Who shall Sköldsvärd choose?"
 vedina.8.t:0 "The Hunt"
 vedina.8.d:0 "Sköldsvärd has chosen to participate in one of the most traditional practices of Vedinan nobility, a hunt! Of course, every one of her suitors has chosen to join the group made up of Vedina's nobles and their relatives. However, Sköldsvärd can only choose one suitor to accompany her personally, who shall she choose?"
 vedina.8.a:0 "Princess Lycklig"
 vedina.8.b:0 "Prince Ondska"
 vedina.8.c:0 "Prince Stridande"
 vedina.9.t:0 "Princess Lycklig Accompanies Sköldsvärd on The Hunt"
 vedina.9.d:0 "Lycklig is not a poor hunter, but she is disgusted by the sport. She expresses to Sköldsvärd that killing the poor animals who have done them no harm but by existing seems a poor waste of Vedina’s natural resources and the talents of their best knights, especially given how most griffons in Vendina can’t even afford meat."
 vedina.9.a:0 "She might have a point?"
 vedina.10.t:0 "Prince Stridande Accompanies Sköldsvärd on The Hunt"
 vedina.10.d:0 "Stridante is a great hunter and gives good tips for Sköldsvärd about how to improve her hunting, but in whispers, so that she isn’t embarrassed or condescended. Together, they bag two arctic foxes, all the while exchanging jokes."
 vedina.10.a:0 "A great time?"
 vedina.11.t:0 "Prince Ondska Accompanies Sköldsvärd on The Hunt"
 vedina.11.d:0 "Ondska engages Sköldsvärd in a talk about the hunting that evolves into a discussion about the needs of the strong and of the weak. During this discussion, Ondska points that that given Vedina’s limited resources and manpower, it only stands to reason that the most intelligent, the most strong, and the most physically able, should get the majority of the resources. "
 vedina.11.a:0 "An interesting discussion?"
 vedina.12.t:0 "After the Hunt"
 vedina.12.d:0 "After the hunt, the court sits down in a glen for a nice relaxing picnic. It's a beautiful day, though, rather quiet considering that it's such a nice day. There are no birds. Wait, there's some rustling sound in the bushes and a growling noise."
 vedina.12.a:0 "BEAR ATTACK!"
 vedina.13.t:0 "Lycklig Reacts to the Bear"
 vedina.13.d:0 "Lycklig screams in horror, but after a moment’s hesitation, she readies her weapon, and ushers the younger members of the party away, shielding them from the bear as best she can. She’s clearly inexperienced with her weapon though, and utterly terrified."
 vedina.13.a:0 "Sköldsvärd glances to Stridande"
 vedina.14.t:0 "Stridande Reacts to the Bear"
 vedina.14.d:0 "Stridante leaps up to fight the bear telling everybody to get back and fires his gun. He’s shaking from adrenaline, so he misses his shot, but charges forward regardless screaming “For Vedina!” He is smacked aside by the bear for his trouble, but he didn’t even hesitate for a second."
 vedina.14.a:0 "Readying her own weapon, Sköldsvärd looks to Ondska"
 vedina.15.t:0 "Ondska Reacts to the Bear Attack"
 vedina.15.d:0 "Ondska is nowhere to be found when the bear attacks, at least at first. After seeing Lycklig usher the younger members of the party away, Sköldsvärd does notice Ondska dive on the bear from behind, hacking at it with his claws, screeching, “The strong will devour the weak and become stronger in return!” The bear claws at him and he manages to dodge the strikes, before circling up to a higher altitude"
 vedina.15.a:0 "It's Sköldsvärd's turn"
 vedina.16.t:0 "Princess Sköldsvärd Fights the Bear"
 vedina.16.d:0 "Sköldsvärd fires her rifle, hitting the bear, but the beast is somehow still moving. She draws her sword and swoops at it. It bats at her, but she dodges it's strike, and slashes at it's lower leg. She manages a hit, but it's gaining on her. With a cry, Sköldsvärd buries her blade with a perfect thrust into it's throat. The nobles erupt in cheers."
 vedina.16.a:0 "The hunt ends, and what a hunt it was."
 vedina.17.t:0 "The Ball"
 vedina.17.d:0 "It's the start of the Ball! A less traditional Vedinan activity, but it's a fun way to blow off steam and mingle. But which prince shall Sköldsvärd ask to be her partner at the ball?"
 vedina.17.a:0 "Princess Lycklig"
 vedina.17.b:0 "Prince Stridande"
 vedina.17.c:0 "Prince Ondska"
 vedina.18.t:0 "Princess Lycklig with Sköldsvärd at the Ball"
 vedina.18.d:0 "Sköldsvärd takes Lycklig’s claws and finds herself floating through the air, guided by a griffon who clearly enjoys, and knows how to dance. As they whirl through the hall, Lycklig brings up the subject of the commonfolk of Vendina and their mutters about how if only they could share in this wealth and entertainment. Sköldsvärd listens to Lycklig’s ideas about how to bring Vendina out of poverty, many of which are quite well-supported. All the while, they twirl through the air in their own bubble. It's a informative, but intimate moment in time."
 vedina.18.a:0 "A great first dance?"
 vedina.19.t:0 "Prince Stridande with Sköldsvärd at the Ball"
 vedina.19.d:0 "Surprisingly enough, Stridante is a very bad dancer. He nearly slams Sköldsvärd into the pillars of the dance hall several times. He does apologize profusely, listens to Sköldsvärd’s instructions carefully and keeps trying his best. By the end of the dance, he’s… less crash-prone, but by no means a good dancer."
 vedina.19.a:0 "Well at least he tried?"
 vedina.20.t:0 "Princes Ondska with Sköldsvärd at the Ball"
 vedina.20.d:0 "The prince is striking in his black jacket and decorative pointed steel helmet. His dancing leaves a bit to be desired as he’s a bit stiff, and prefers to take the lead, but he is competent. As you waltz through the air, he asks if Sköldsvärd has heard of the old myths about the dark magicians. She responds that she has, and when she does, his eyes light up. He muses on how they brought their wielders such power and strength that all feared them, and asks Sköldsvärd if it would be nice for Vedina to be feared for a change, instead of being trampled down by the Griffon Empire. “After all,” he points out, “the Empire is experiencing a period of resurgence. We can industrialize and reform all we want, but can we do so fast enough?” When Sköldsvärd doesn't respond, he says in an off-handed manner, that he doesn’t mean to say that Vedina should immediately embrace dark magic, but that considering how Equestria has magic, the Griffon Empire has population and industry, they should definitely look at… different ways to apply magic so that they can survive. In this, he seems quite sincere in his belief."
 vedina.20.a:0 "Was he really here to dance?"
 vedina.21.t:0 "After the First Dance"
 vedina.21.d:0 "The first dance is finished! Now, time to mingle with all the suitors."
 vedina.21.a:0 "Onward!"
 vedina.22.t:0 "Sköldsvärd has a quiet conversation with Ondska"
 vedina.22.d:0 "Ondska takes Sköldsvärd aside to have a quiet conversation. Sköldsvärd listens to him talk about the dangers of Vedina being so weak in the face of the power of the Griffon Empire. He has a point, but there’s an odd light that flickers in his eyes as he goes on and on about how it might makes right, and the weak’s destiny is to be subsumed by the strong."
 vedina.22.a:0 "Okay..."
 vedina.23.t:0 "Sköldsvärd has a drink with Stridande"
 vedina.23.d:0 "Stridante pulls Sköldsvärd over after her first dance, treating her to a drink. He compliments her on her beauty, and grace, but oddly enough, he also makes a few biting jokes at the expense of some of the attendees. Like how “Countess Incontinentia sends her children to private school. And yet she is trying to pay her way to be appointed Minister for Education.” He’s clearly got strong opinions about the state of Vendian nobility."
 vedina.23.a:0 "Hmm..."
 vedina.24.t:0 "Lycklig dances with Sköldsvärd"
 vedina.24.d:0 "Lycklig asks Sköldsvärd for her second dance, and she accepts. They whirl through the ballroom, Lycklig and Sköldsvärd finding themselves perfectly in sync as they speed up. Lycklig is thoroughly and sincerely revelling the dance and doing her best to try to make sure Sköldsvärd enjoys the dance as well. She frequently, and rightfully compliments Sköldsvärd on how much work she has put into appearing the perfect princess."
 vedina.24.a:0 "That was nice wasn't it?"
 vedina.25.t:0 "All in all a successful ball!"
 vedina.25.d:0 "Great! There will be opportunities to get to know the other suitors later, but it's been a nice night!"
 vedina.25.a:0 "What next?"
 vedina.26.t:0 "The Feast"
 vedina.26.d:0 "Feasting is a Vedinan tradition about as old as hunting, and thus, an excellent time to enjoy good food, some performers doing acrobatics and singing in the background, and good company. Who shall Sköldsvärd seat next to her?"
 vedina.26.a:0 "Princess Lycklig"
 vedina.26.b:0 "Prince Stridande"
 vedina.26.c:0 "Prince Ondska"
 vedina.27.t:0 "Princess Lycklig sits with Sköldsvärd for The Feast"
 vedina.27.d:0 "Instead of making Lycklig eager to eat, the opulence of the feast seems to annoy the princess. She eats the food almost… guiltily, as if she doesn’t to eat it. Sköldsvärd presses Lycklig as to why, which is when Lycklig spits out that a poor Vendinan family can’t even afford the plate that this food is being served on. She tells Sköldsvärd that she appreciates her hospitality, but for the sake of the Vendinan griffons, she will only eat until she is full, and will not gorge herself."
 vedina.27.a:0 "At least she's not wasting food"
 vedina.28.t:0 "Prince Stridande sits with Sköldsvärd for The Feast"
 vedina.28.d:0 "Stridante grumbles about how the food isn’t as good as the rations in the Griffonian Empire. He wonders openly if some noble lord or lady’s swindled the best ingredients from the Royal kitchen and replaced them with second-rate ingredients. He asks Sköldsvärd if the Vedian noble families will ever fulfil the roles they were sworn to."
 vedina.28.a:0 "Huh..."
 vedina.29.t:0 "Prince Ondska sits with Sköldsvärd for The Feast"
 vedina.29.d:0 "Ondska is very happy to sit next to Sköldsvärd. He muses that the view from the table head must look rather interesting. But he also points to Sköldsvärd that a number of her nobles are very much playing their own game, and clearly wary of her.\n\n“Wouldn’t it be nice to have all of them love you? To have it so that they only desire to serve you?” He explains that if Vedina is to be protected from aggression and to come to her own on the world stage, they need to be united as a military state, where all must serve for the country’s benefit. They would all be guided by one strong ruler.\n\nWhen Sköldsvärd asks about the consequences of such militarization and centralization Ondska shrugs.\n\n“The strong devour the weak in this world Princess, and I know you have the ability to do what’s necessary.”"
 vedina.29.a:0 "Hmm..."
 vedina.30.t:0 "After the Feasting"
 vedina.30.d:0 "Now that she's full, it's time for Sköldsvärd to mingle with the suitors. There's some entertainment, a band, some performers, etcetera, playing in the background."
 vedina.30.a:0 "How's Stridante doing?"
 vedina.31.t:0 "Prince Stridante Comments on the Feast"
 vedina.31.d:0 "Stridante comments that the entertainment is alright, but that the performers don’t seem to be doing it happily. He suspects that they aren’t being paid in full and laments to Sköldsvärd that the nobility no longer sponsors the arts, and rather, tries to cheat artists out of their hard earned cash with fine print."
 vedina.31.a:0 "So how is Prince Ondska doing?"
 vedina.32.t:0 "Prince Ondska Makes Some Comments"
 vedina.32.d:0 "Ondska is looking at a stained glass window dedicated to the Wise Lady, and showing the first king, Forena, being given guidance. He mutters that if she was so wise, why didn’t she push the king to expand southward.\n\nSeeing Sköldsvärd, he smiles and points out that it’s rather impressive that the Wise Lady is worshipped even today and that her influence is so widespread.\n\nHe seems disapproving of the Wise Lady, though, and when Sköldsvärd inquires, he grimaces and says the fact she only provided guidance has led to Vedina being in this position. If she was an active god who would lead, and exerted her power and wisdom to rule Vedina, then they wouldn’t have been annexed by the Griffon Empire. "
 vedina.32.a:0 "Okay, how is Princess Lycklig doing?"
 vedina.33.t:0 "Princess Lycklig Comments on Wine"
 vedina.33.d:0 "Sköldsvärd walks by Lycklig, noticing that she doesn’t seem to like the drink and mutters something about how most griffons taste alcohol but once in their life. It’s an odd comment given that she does finish her drink and greets Sköldsvärd with a winning smile, complimenting her on her dress. Sköldsvärd asks Lycklig if what she says is true. Surprised, Lycklig says yes, explaining how the nobles hold a stranglehold on wine."
 vedina.33.a:0 "Hmm."
 vedina.34.t:0 "Feast Over"
 vedina.34.d:0 "All in all, a successful feast. There will be time to mingle further with the suitors, but at least Sköldsvärd has a sense of who the suitors are."
 vedina.34.a:0 "Now, what next?"
 vedina.35.t:0 "A Night Out"
 vedina.35.d:0 "Sköldsvärd decides to have a night out with one of her suitors. But whom to choose?"
 vedina.35.a:0 "Prince Ondska"
 vedina.35.b:0 "Prince Stridande"
 vedina.35.c:0 "Princess Lycklig"
 vedina.36.t:0 "Sköldsvärd and Prince Ondska's Night Out"
 vedina.36.d:0 "The place Ondska takes Sköldsvärd is a quiet temple to the Wise Lady, far from the city. It’s a marvel of old Vedinan architecture and it’s got this tranquil atmosphere to it.\n\nAt least at first glance, as Sköldsvärd and Ondska enter deeper in, the mood changes. Something’s off about this temple. The end of it has the typical statue of the Wise Lady, but that seems  diminished and compared to the statues of the massive Griffons that flank her.\n\nOndska, who had been talking going on about how the precursors to the First Lady had magical abilities despite the fact they were griffons, falls silent. He tells of Sköldsvärd that if she’s noticed something odd about this temple, then she has good senses, because the temple isn’t one to the Wise Lady.\n\nOndska taps the wall too the left of the statue of the Wise Lady and pushes a block of stone, along with the wall. It rotates with a groan. Ondska walks, grinning widely and Sköldsvärd follows him, slowly. The circular chamber beyond is some kind of old ritual chamber with an al with old brown stains in the centre. As Sköldsvärd narrows her eyes, she realizes it’s in the shape of a pentagram and it’s drawn in that same brown color.\n\nOndska explains that this was where the ancients who predated the Wise Lady used to summon and create contracts with demons, which allowed them to wield powers despite their griffon heritage.  Sköldsvärd asks for clarification and Ondska says that demons tend to be misunderstood as purely evil. “They’re more demanding than evil. They follow their contracts to the letter, which foolish summoners tend to forget, and wise summoners always remember.” He points out though that the powers bestowed upon by the demons could allow their masters to perform feats only dreamt of. The pictures and murals on the walls of the chambers seem to attest to this, as they show griffons leading armies into battle, and casting spells that devastate their pony or griffon enemies."
 vedina.36.a:0 "Demon Summoners… Who would have known?"
 vedina.37.t:0 "Sköldsvärd and Prince Stridande's Night Out"
 vedina.37.d:0 "Stridante asks Sköldsvärd to wear a disguise, and takes her into Luckport. There they have a great time dancing in the “Brass Galleon” bar and there’s a lot of interesting company. Many of the bar’s customers are Vedina-born young military officers, who grumble at how the nobility keeps cutting their budget and how tradition rather than innovation seems to be the call of the day. They’re also excellent comedians who take care to make the disguised Stridante and Sköldsvärd comfortable and included."
 vedina.37.a:0 "Well, that was fun?"
 vedina.38.t:0 "Princess Lycklig and Sköldsvärd have a Night Out"
 vedina.38.d:0 "Lycklig takes Sköldsvärd - who goes in disguise - to a salon club with a group of other female griffons. Some from Equestria, others from Griffonia and some haling as far as from the Riverlands. They engage in a concerted discussion about the wealth gap between the poor and rich and how it ends up hurting both. Some of them have quite outlandish ideas, but Lycklig, who is presenting, puts forward a rather conservative plan that supports gradual development, with the adjustment of Vendinan traditions to accommodate a modern world. After the salon is finished, Lycklig invites Sköldsvärd to ask questions about her plan, which Sköldsvärd does, and they continue to discuss Vendina’s economy into the night.\n\nSköldsvärd does have one big question though, how will Lycklig provide her with an heir? Lycklig counters with, “provide you with an heir, why can it not be the other way around?”\n\nLycklig then laughs and explains that modern magic has the ability to help either Sköldsvärd produce an heir or Lycklig. They can settle the question of who would be carrying the baby if they would want, but Lycklig says that she is willing."
 vedina.38.a:0 "Oh... OH?"
 vedina.39.t:0 "A Walk in the Garden"
 vedina.39.d:0 "Sköldsvärd decides to go for a quiet walk with one of her suitors. But whom to choose?"
 vedina.39.a:0 "Prince Ondska"
 vedina.39.b:0 "Prince Stridante"
 vedina.39.c:0 "Princess Lycklig"
 vedina.40.t:0 "Sköldsvärd and Ondska's Walk in the Garden"
 vedina.40.d:0 "Ondska seems almost disdainful of the flowers of the gardens. Most of the time he keeps talking about how Vedina must abandon the idea of trying to provide for every griffon, and focus on providing as much resources as possible for those actually able to make a difference. Occasionally, he points to the odd spider or predatory insect that he and Sköldsvärd run into and uses them as an example the possibility of what might happen to Vedina; it’s fall or it’s rise."
 vedina.40.a:0 "A good walk?"
 vedina.41.t:0 "Sköldsvärd and Stridande's Walk in the Garden"
 vedina.41.d:0 "During their walk in the Stridante confides in Sköldsvärd about his worry about the nobility of Vedina and how they’ve forgotten their duty. Stridante and Sköldsvärd also talk about their favorite legends and old heroes from Vedina’s past. They both admire King Forena, but find that they have a common adoration of “The Wise Lady” in Vendina’s history."
 vedina.41.a:0 "Nice?"
 vedina.42.t:0 "Sköldsvärd and Lycklig's Walk in the Garden"
 vedina.42.d:0 "Lycklig finds the gardens peaceful, and says as much to Sköldsvärd, but she seems to be rather saddened by them. Sköldsvärd wonders why and presses Lycklig, until she asks “Why does such beauty has to be only for the rich? Can we not have parks, and public gardens, where children, and the elderly of all classes can play together? Can share ideas and remember that they are all from Vendina?”\n\nSköldsvärd questions Lycklig why she is so concerned and asking this question. Lycklig is silent.\n\n“Because I am a bastard.”\n\nHer father had no other heirs though, and so was forced to legitimize her.  She thus wants change because she can really feel for the common griffon as she has seen and experienced a poor childhood herself, and isn’t going to let her good fortune go to waste. She tells Sköldsvärd that, “If you choose me, I will make sure no Vedinan child grows up hungry, and glaring with hate at the nobility who tax them. I will bring Vedinainto the modern world as your right claw.”"
 vedina.42.a:0 "That was intense?"
 vedina.43.t:0 "The Dinner"
 vedina.43.d:0 "A dinner is a great way for Sköldsvärd to spend time with one of her suitors. But who shall Sköldsvärd pick?"
 vedina.43.a:0 "Prince Ondska"
 vedina.43.b:0 "Princes Stridande"
 vedina.43.c:0 "Princess Lycklig"
 vedina.44.t:0 "Sköldsvärd and Ondska have Dinner"
 vedina.44.d:0 "The Griffon Prince is pulling a full charm offensive, of sorts. Ondska is certainly attempting to be suave. \n\nHowever, his flirting compliments tend to be along the lines of, “You know, things would run so much smoother if you were the only power in Vedina.” Or, “The Kingdom should trust griffons like you more, rather than the law.” And “What do the peasants know of how to rule? Only you, and I of course, know anything of ruling.”"
 vedina.44.a:0 "At least he's trying?"
 vedina.45.t:0 "Sköldsvärd and Stridande have Dinner"
 vedina.45.d:0 "Stridante is an excellent conversationalist, regaling Sköldsvärd about his stories in the Griffon Empire and during training. Toward the end of the dinner, Sköldsvärd and Stridante also get into a discussion about how to apply Vendina’s traditions in a modern world, and its role in a modern world. In the end, Stridante states that he thinks that chivalry still has a place, and mentions that no matter who Sköldsvärd chooses, he’ll always be loyal to Vedina, as is his role."
 vedina.45.a:0 "Huh, that seems very good of him?"
 vedina.46.t:0 "Sköldsvärd and Lycklig have Dinner"
 vedina.46.d:0 "Lycklig makes the dinner herself and is a surprisingly good cook. It’s a very romantic atmosphere and Lycklig is very willing to listen to Sköldsvärd complain about the unfair succession rules that are biased against her sex, whilst also cracking a few jokes at her own expense, and at the expense of some of the more stuffy Griffon nobility. It’s a relaxing evening and Lycklig finishes it by serving dessert and dancing with Sköldsvärd to the music of the gramophone."
 vedina.46.a:0 "Nice night?"
 vedina.47.t:0 "The Love Letters"
 vedina.47.d:0 "Having spent some time with all of her suitors, Sköldsvärd is coming close to the point to where she can make a decision. But before she does, three love letters from the three suitors arrive for her."
 vedina.47.a:0 "Time to open them."
 vedina.48.t:0 "Princess Lycklig's Letter"
 vedina.48.d:0 "Lycklig makes the argument that they seem to get along, that unlike the other suitors, they see eye to eye about the female succession and that Sköldsvärd needs help to bring Vedina into the future, not back into the past. And with modern methods, having an heir will not be a challenge. \n\nThe crux of her letter is towards its end, where she concedes that she might not have gotten Sköldsvärd to love her yet. She writes though that regardless, she will be the queen-consort that will help Sköldsvärd lead Vedina to not to militarization, not to whatever insanity that Ondska might be planning, but to the uncertain future, or the “undiscovered country” as Lycklig calls it."
 vedina.48.a:0 "Okay. What did Prince Stridande write?"
 vedina.49.t:0 "Prince Stridande's Letter"
 vedina.49.d:0 "In the love letter, Stridante plays down his status and emphasizes not his wealth, but his chivalry, stating that no matter who Sköldsvärd chooses, he’ll respect her choice. What he does want is to serve and he thinks he can best serve as her consort, to help remind the nobility of their old roles, and to help her make Vendina the bastion of chivalry that they used to be."
 vedina.49.a:0 "Okay. What did Prince Ondska write?"
 vedina.50.t:0 "Prince Ondska's Letter"
 vedina.50.d:0 "Ondska says that he’s not just a good choice, he is the only choice if Sköldsvärd is to rule supreme over Vedina, crushing her enemies underneath her claws and vanquishing dissent. He claims that if she chooses him, he would help her lead Vedina to become the strongest power in the continent."

 vedina_quest.1.t:0 "The Quest of Valor"
 vedina_quest.1.d:0 "One of the Princess' many trials is to prove her valor in combat. Thus, she must scour the land, looking for a suitable challenge to combat. There are many such opportunities, but in order to impress the court, she knows that the victory must be a big one.\n\nEspecially important for Vedina is that the act is a good deed in of itself. The glory must not be for her, but for Vedina and its people. Thus, the Princess wanders into the sleepy village of Dimshadow, reportedly having trouble. She wanders into the tavern and..."
 vedina_quest.1.a:0 "She should investigate right away!"
 vedina_quest.1.b:0 "A drink might be nice"
 vedina_quest.1.c:0 "Maybe in the morning first"
 vedina_quest.2.t:0 "Ahh, that touched the spot"
 vedina_quest.2.d:0 "A refreshing drink and a few smiles later and the Princess had herself a rather informative discussion with the bartender who offered her a room for a price.\n\nIt turns out that the village had been under the thumb of a dragon for a while, having to sacrifice its wealth to it on a regular basis. Why had it not been reported, simple, the local lord was not as attentive as he should be. Still, fighting a dragon, that would certainly impress the court."
 vedina_quest.2.a:0 "A dragon eh?"
 vedina_quest.3.t:0 "A good night's rest"
 vedina_quest.3.d:0 "There is nothing quite like a good night's rest, and Sköldsvärd has now found herself quite well rested, eager to take on whatever challenge befalls the village. It has given her time to reflect, and she had decided she should ask the locals."
 vedina_quest.3.a:0 "Perfect"
 vedina_quest.4.t:0 "A dragon?!"
 vedina_quest.4.d:0 "It was a dragon. A dragon had taken up residence in the nearby mountain, and was extorting the town of its riches. A vile injustice indeed. Sköldsvärd needed to deal with this, and thus she vowed to vanquish it.\n\nSuch a thing would not be easy. She would need assistance to fell such a beast, but who?"
 vedina_quest.4.a:0 "The local knights garrison!"
 vedina_quest.4.b:0 "We need a bigger gun..."
 vedina_quest.4.c:0 "The people must defend themselves!"
 vedina_quest.5.t:0 "The Knights"
 vedina_quest.5.d:0 "A small and effective force of Vedinan's finest are in the area. It would be foolish not to utilise them. A quick trip to their garrison and they are happy to assist the Princess in whatever way she needs.\n\nOf course, proper preperation is sometimes key, but it may be better to deal with this quickly. Sköldsvärd can spend time researching a proper plan, or she can take what she has and hope for the best. What is her decision?"
 vedina_quest.5.a:0 "Lets play this smart"
 vedina_quest.5.b:0 "Charge!"
 vedina_quest.6.t:0 "Poison?"
 vedina_quest.6.d:0 "The battalion quartermaster has done the research, and has found an old monster hunting manual dating back several hundred years. Apparently there is a substance which can be made from simple herbs which will prove very poisonous to dragons. It won't kill one, but enough to give the knights an edge.\n\nStill, isn't such an advantage a dishonourable one?"
 vedina_quest.6.a:0 "Use it!"
 vedina_quest.6.b:0 "We can do without"
 vedina_quest.7.t:0 "Victory!"
 vedina_quest.7.d:0 "The brave knights charged forth with the Princess at their head, dashing into the ancient lair of the dragon. There a heated battle errupted, quickly silencing the ancient dragon in the mountain. He put up a good fight, but armed with poisoned weapons and a determination to defend their country, the dragon has been defeated. The killing blow was dealt by the Princess herself and the dragon's treasure horde has been liberated and donated back to the peaceful village. A victory for liberty, and for Vedina, and for the Princess who has proved her valor in battle."
 vedina_quest.7.a:0 "Excellent"
 vedina_quest.8.t:0 "Dishonourable Discharge"
 vedina_quest.8.d:0 "The Princess is right, the knights of Vedina do not fight in such underhanded ways. They will fight the dragon with honour and that is that. Poison is for weaklings and treasonous scoundrels. Thus, Sköldsvärd is resolved, she will fight the dragon in a fair fight."
 vedina_quest.8.a:0 "It is the right thing to do"
 vedina_quest.9.t:0 "Victory!"
 vedina_quest.9.d:0 "The brave knights charged forth with the Princess at their head, dashing into the ancient lair of the dragon. There a heated battle errupted. It was a long and drawn out battle and some casualties were taken. Still, at the very least the dragon has been killed by the Princess' claws and the dragon's horde, returned to the village below."
 vedina_quest.9.a:0 "A good outcome at least"
 vedina_quest.10.t:0 "The Royal Artillery"
 vedina_quest.10.d:0 "One of Vedina's finest artillery battalions are stationed nearby. A short journey would bring the Princess to their barracks. It didn't take much to work out that a dragon couldn't possibly withstand a barrage from modern artillery guns. Thus, the artillery company is more than happy to assist. The plan is to use the Princess as bait for the dragon, to lure him out to a specific location. Then, the artillery can blow him to smithereens."
 vedina_quest.10.a:0 "I should bring a raincoat"
 vedina_quest.11.t:0 "Hook, line..."
 vedina_quest.11.d:0 "With that the Princess returns to the village. A nice open field lays in front of the dragon's lair, making it a prime location to bombard. Thus, Sköldsvärd leaves the artillery company to set up and journeys to the dragon's lair. Once she has recieved the green light from a quick radio confirmation, the Princess dashes into the cave and attacks the dragon."
 vedina_quest.11.a:0 "Don't you die on me now"
 vedina_quest.12.t:0 "Splat!"
 vedina_quest.12.d:0 "After a few moments, Sköldsvärd returns, with a very angry dragon on her tail. The lumbering beast crashes out of the cave and heads right into the open field. The artillery begins its bombardment, raining shells upon shells on the dragon until there is nothing left but a crater. Sköldsvärd has survived, having gotten herself well clear, and has earned victory over the dragon, returning its horde to the people of the town."
 vedina_quest.12.a:0 "Anyone up for pancakes?"
 vedina_quest.13.t:0 "The People Rise"
 vedina_quest.13.d:0 "This village would do better if it learned to fend for itself. Thus, Sköldsvärd should assist them in defeating this dragon. The people seem reluctant, but the Princess enthuses them that with her help they can accomplish this lofty task. With that she manages to form an improptu militia."
 vedina_quest.13.a:0 "An ambush is our best bet"
 vedina_quest.13.b:0 "Lets seal the cave"
 vedina_quest.13.c:0 "Perhaps trained soldiers would be better..."
 vedina_quest.14.t:0 "An Ambush is chosen"
 vedina_quest.14.d:0 "It has been decided that the militia's best chance will be to ambush the dragon outside its lair and use specialised weighted nets to hold it down while they slowly kill the beast with longspears. The preperations are long, and the Princess assists with training and construction. It is hard work, but eventually, they are ready. With Sköldsvärd as bait, it is all down to her."
 vedina_quest.14.a:0 "Charge!"
 vedina_quest.15.t:0 "Victory!"
 vedina_quest.15.d:0 "The trap was a success. Sköldsvärd dashed into the cave to get the dragon's attention before running away, drawing the dragon out. There the people of Dimshadow struck and they struck hard, trapping the dragon and fighting it at length with long spears and poles. It was a slow and painful demise for the creature, and not all of the militia made it back alive. Still, with the dragon's horde returned to them, they can now rebuild."
 vedina_quest.15.a:0 "Job done"
 vedina_quest.16.t:0 "Blow it all up"
 vedina_quest.16.d:0 "Frankly, getting a militia to fight a dragon is a bad idea. So why not instead use something else entirely? The power of dynamite! With a few careful demolition charges, the sleeping dragon can be killed without a fight. Ingenious indeed. After all, why wake it if it is in hibernation? With the dynamite secured and the plan in place, all that is needed is the execution."
 vedina_quest.16.a:0 "Just don't bring the whole mountain down..."
 vedina_quest.17.t:0 "Boom!"
 vedina_quest.17.d:0 "A single deafening explosion rung through the mountain as the dynamite was triggered. No doubt the dragon was quite surprised when it exploded in its sleep. Placing the dynamite had been a challenge, but Sköldsvärd is light on her claws, and managed to place it in all the right places. With the dragon dead, the villagers can now mine out the old lair to retrieve its treasure."
 vedina_quest.17.a:0 "An rather sudden end."
 vedina_quest.18.t:0 "Bandits!"
 vedina_quest.18.d:0 "Another great Vedinan value is the value of honour. Thus, the Princess has come to the County of Talonstaad. Reports of bandits and brigands have come from the county recently, and the local Vedinan nobility seems to have done nothing about it. In order to deliver justice to the county, the Princess must intervene!"
 vedina_quest.18.a:0 "Charge!"
 vedina_quest.18.b:0 "Lure them into an ambush"
 vedina_quest.56.t:0 "Bandits!"
 vedina_quest.56.d:0 "This isn't about just bandits anymore. Unforetunately the quest will not be so straightforward. On confronting the bandits, the Princess has learned that the local count is actually sponsoring them! He is using the bandits to raid trade convoys which in turn drives up cost of trade in the area, trade he is making quite the profit from. Sköldsvärd could just leave it, she had defeated the bandits for now, but would it not be better to solve this once and for all?"
 vedina_quest.56.a:0 "Let's solve this properly"
 vedina_quest.56.b:0 "Nah, job done"
 vedina_quest.19.t:0 "Confronting the Lord"
 vedina_quest.19.d:0 "The Count of Talonstaad greeted the Princess with open claws. He freely admits that he was using the bandits for his own gains. In fact, he offers the Princess a portion of the profits should she let him continue. It's a generous offer indeed, but can the Princess really afford to damage her integrity?"
 vedina_quest.19.a:0 "For the right price she can"
 vedina_quest.19.b:0 "Never!"
 vedina_quest.20.t:0 "Change in management"
 vedina_quest.20.d:0 "The Count has to go, that is for sure. But should the Princess deal with this? She could simply promote a new knight to the position and revoke the count's title, but that would no doubt anger the nobility. She could put him to trial as well, surely that would be the right thing to do?"
 vedina_quest.20.a:0 "I am the law!"
 vedina_quest.20.b:0 "A fair trial!"
 vedina_quest.21.t:0 "The Trial"
 vedina_quest.21.d:0 "After a fair trial by public jury, the Count is sentenced to death. He is executed and a new regional governor installed. Justice has pervailed and the Princess had proven herself to be an honourable ruler for Vedina."
 vedina_quest.21.a:0 "Honour is all"
 vedina_quest.22.t:0 "Charity"
 vedina_quest.22.d:0 "In order to ensure a prosperous realm the king's court is expected to donate vast sums of money to good causes in order to boost economic growth in the country and to ensure the health and safety of the people. In order to get Vedina back on its feet and to ensure that its people prosper, Sköldsvärd is tasked with leading the donations."
 vedina_quest.22.a:0 "What is the situation?"
 vedina_quest.22.b:0 "No charity on my watch!"
 vedina_quest.23.t:0 "Charity"
 vedina_quest.23.d:0 "There are three distinct issues the poor suffer in Vedina. Firstly, communual spaces and engagement have suffered due to the increased dependence on industrialisation. We should invest in community projects and centres in order to bring communities closer together once again. The second is the large amount of sick in the country. Modern medicine has not quite made its way over to the griffon continent, so we should take steps to ensure that the people get the care they need. Thirdly, there has been an increase in the awareness of the plight of the disabled. If a factory worker is severely injured at work, then most of the time they are let go from the factory. We should ensure there is some kind of social care for these people, to ensure their families do not go hungry."
 vedina_quest.23.a:0 "Focus on community projects"
 vedina_quest.23.b:0 "Focus on the sick"
 vedina_quest.23.c:0 "Focus on the disabled"
 vedina_quest.23.e:0 "No. We're trying this new thing called austerity."
 vedina_quest.24.t:0 "Charity"
 vedina_quest.24.d:0 "There is still more to do. We have yet to focus on some areas in our country. What should we focus on next?"
 vedina_quest.24.a:0 "Focus on community projects"
 vedina_quest.24.b:0 "Focus on the sick"
 vedina_quest.24.c:0 "Focus on the disabled"
 vedina_quest.24.e:0 "This is taking too long!"
 vedina_quest.25.t:0 "Charity"
 vedina_quest.25.d:0 "There is still more to do. We have yet to focus on some areas in our country. What should we focus on next?"
 vedina_quest.25.a:0 "Focus on community projects"
 vedina_quest.25.b:0 "Focus on the sick"
 vedina_quest.25.c:0 "Focus on the disabled"
 vedina_quest.25.e:0 "This is taking too long!"
 vedina_quest.26.t:0 "Community projects"
 vedina_quest.26.d:0 "Investing in public parks and community projects, we have managed to restore a community spirit with the people. With some government support, these initiatives have soared, and community clubs and celebrations have began in earnest."
 vedina_quest.26.a:0 "Excellent"
 vedina_quest.26.b:0 "Excellent"
 vedina_quest.26.c:0 "Excellent"
 vedina_quest.27.t:0 "The Sick"
 vedina_quest.27.d:0 "Investment in modern hospitals and healthcare have borne fruit. Our people are healthier and better suited for modern life. Life expectcancy rates are up and productivity is up as well. The new health service industry is booming and the people are greatful to the Princess for this investment."
 vedina_quest.27.a:0 "Excellent"
 vedina_quest.27.b:0 "Excellent"
 vedina_quest.27.c:0 "Excellent"
 vedina_quest.28.t:0 "The Disabled"
 vedina_quest.28.d:0 "Our focus on disabled citizens has earned us great respect. A new social credit has been established for those injured in the workplace, which means that less families are going hungry. With this safety net, the disabled can focus on retraining and rebuilding their livelihood."
 vedina_quest.28.a:0 "Excellent"
 vedina_quest.28.b:0 "Excellent"
 vedina_quest.28.c:0 "Excellent"
 vedina_quest.29.t:0 "Sköldsvärd the Charitable"
 vedina_quest.29.d:0 "With three major social issues solved by copious amounts of government funding, Sköldsvärd's position has been strengthened. She has been established as capable of social reform and has proven that she is more than capable of the knightly virtue of charity."
 vedina_quest.29.a:0 "Huzzah"
 vedina_quest.30.t:0 "Austerity"
 vedina_quest.30.d:0 "The notion of charity is all well and good, but it doesn't help the economy. We should cut this waste and ensure that we continue to profit. There is no profit in such activities after all. In order to get our economy back on track, we must cut off this fat and prosper."
 vedina_quest.30.a:0 "Yes, perfect."
 vedina_quest.31.t:0 "Austerty"
 vedina_quest.31.d:0 "With the budget cuts we have purposed, we have managed to cut several unnessesary services down to the bone. This has resulted in a number of savings which can be poured back into our economy."
 vedina_quest.31.a:0 "Job done!"
 vedina_quest.32.t:0 "A Quest of Patience"
 vedina_quest.32.d:0 "Patience, another grand Vedinan virtue. Patience and tolerance of others, giving a knight the ability to learn and adapt to other cultures. For it is true, the world is full of magic and strange griffons aplenty. Perhaps seeking out others will teach Sköldsvärd of patience and tolerance."
 vedina_quest.32.a:0 "Lets go out and about"
 vedina_quest.32.b:0 "Perhaps a good book will teach me?"
 vedina_quest.33.t:0 "A day in the woods"
 vedina_quest.33.d:0 "The woods are quiet and peaceful. The Princess found a gentle serenity in the birdsong and the sway of the trees. Surely nothing bad could lurk here? No, just nature's guardians. Yet still, something stirs in the bushes. What could it be?"
 vedina_quest.33.a:0 "Is it a bird? A plane? No, its..."
 vedina_quest.34.t:0 "A monster!"
 vedina_quest.34.d:0 "A great lumbering ugly ogre stamped out of the bushes and yelled at the princess, lifting a club in its green hands. 'Oi, you,' he shouted. 'Get out, of ma' forest,' he commanded her. Clearly the ogre was not happy about her being here. The objective of this quest was to make friends and understand creatures, but the ogre's threat makes the Princess doubt. What should she do?"
 vedina_quest.34.a:0 "Charge!"
 vedina_quest.34.b:0 "Surely this anger must come from somewhere"
 vedina_quest.35.t:0 "One Dead Ogre"
 vedina_quest.35.d:0 "The ogre is no match for Sköldsvärd's blade. The battle is quick and decisive and Sköldsvärd comes out of it quite unscathed. The the ogre dead, she returns home. Perhaps she can't be friends with everything after all..."
 vedina_quest.35.a:0 "Oh well..."
 vedina_quest.36.t:0 "Ogres are like onions?"
 vedina_quest.36.d:0 "Sköldsvärd told the ogre she meant no harm. She had come seeking out the ogre and wished to know more about him and his kind. She told him she wanted to be friends, and the ogre actually cried. He gave her a big strong hug and told her no griffon had ever wanted to be his friend before. After a short introduction, he invited the Princess back to his hut and went on a long monologue about how the world didn't understand him. Apparently he was ecking out a living in the forest and only wished to be left in peace, yet the locals continued to harass him. 'You see Sköldsvärd,' he told her. 'Ogres are like...' he struggled for a metaphor. 'Are like onions! They... make people cry. But the most important thing is. They have layers,' he told her. 'Ogres have layers. And so do other creatures,' he said. That lesson would stick with Sköldsvärd. Each person was far more complex than they first appeared. She left the ogre then and vowed to visit from time to time, but most importantly, she instructed the local constabulary to cease their raids on the ogre's land."
 vedina_quest.36.a:0 "Who knew?"
 vedina_quest.37.t:0 "A crazy guy!"
 vedina_quest.37.d:0 "A rather old and rather mothbitten griffon stumbled out of the bushes and gestured at the Princess. 'Oi you,' he snapped at her. 'Get out of here. Government spy, i know what you're doing. You're here for my chest of gold aren't you. Well you won't get it, over my dead body.' Sköldsvärd is taken aback by the griffon's hostility. Perhaps there is some wisdom to be learned here, but then again, from the looks of this old coot, it will likely be a waste of time. What should she do?"
 vedina_quest.37.a:0 "This guy needs to be in an asylum"
 vedina_quest.37.b:0 "Perhaps she should speak more softly"
 vedina_quest.38.t:0 "Public Service"
 vedina_quest.38.d:0 "A quiet tip to the local constabulary and the old man has been carted off to the asylum. Apparently he is recieving treatment for his unique condition and he will not bother the locals anymore. However, Sköldsvärd wonders if that was the right decision. She didn't even try to figure out if the old man was actually ill..."
 vedina_quest.38.a:0 "At least that's one quest down"
 vedina_quest.39.t:0 "A curious theory"
 vedina_quest.39.d:0 "It seems that the old coot is rather obsessed with some sort of government conspiracy. It takes several days to earn his trust, and once it is finally earned Sköldsvärd begins to see that he has much wisdom. The old hermit was an assasin and knows much about political intrigue, lessons that Sköldsvärd could well learn from."
 vedina_quest.39.a:0 "Informative and useful"
 vedina_quest.40.t:0 "Feeling Bookish"
 vedina_quest.40.d:0 "Rather than go outside, Sköldsvärd thinks that she should instead read a book. After all, all this questing has taken it out of her a bit, and she wants a nice quiet weekend away with a good book. But what to read?"
 vedina_quest.40.a:0 "Isn't there a new romance novel?"
 vedina_quest.40.b:0 "How about a magic book?"
 vedina_quest.41.t:0 "Very Stirring"
 vedina_quest.41.d:0 "The romance novel has Sköldsvärd enthralled all week. A lovely griffon couple struggling with debt and the burden of trying to raise children are the main characters. With everything going on, their relationship has stalled, and the book follows their quest to rekindle their relationship and rebuild their lives. Sköldsvärd wonders at its meaning and if she might end up feeling that same love and romance, perhaps a fling with an unsuspecting griffon will quell these needy feelings."
 vedina_quest.41.a:0 "A fling will certainly suffice"
 vedina_quest.41.b:0 "A romance takes work!"
 vedina_quest.42.t:0 "A one night stand"
 vedina_quest.42.d:0 "That griffon will never know just who the lovely dashing griffoness was. They met in a cozy bar just on the outskirts of the city. She wanted him and he wanted her. After all was said and done, Sköldsvärd was left feeling empty. There was little point in it all, and she only felt that wonderful feeling for a brief time. Could it be she was wrong?"
 vedina_quest.42.a:0 "Dissapointing"
 vedina_quest.43.t:0 "Waiting for the one"
 vedina_quest.43.d:0 "Sköldsvärd remains determined. Of course, such love cannot be earned in a single night. She will have to wait and hope that her future husband, or wife, is as wonderful as the griffons described in her book. Thus Sköldsvärd resolves to wait until she has been married to experience the pleasures of the flesh."
 vedina_quest.43.a:0 "Waiting for a better reward"
 vedina_quest.44.t:0 "A magic book"
 vedina_quest.44.d:0 "The magic book is from Equestria, funnily enough. While griffons have their own magic, the magic of Equestria's unicorns is very unknown to Sköldsvärd. The book quickly becomes a fascination, the arcane mysteries that unicorns can tap into and bend to their will is quite staggering and different to how griffons react to magical forces. She certainly could know more, but how should she go about that?"
 vedina_quest.44.a:0 "She'll kidnap a unicorn"
 vedina_quest.44.b:0 "She'll befriend a unicorn"
 vedina_quest.45.t:0 "Captured!"
 vedina_quest.45.d:0 "Surprisingly it doesn't take much to find a unicorn to capture. There are a few Equestrian magicians in Vedina, most of which are explorers or foreign advisors. It is fairly trivial to trick one into an ambush and capture one. After the ambush, Sköldsvärd interogates the pony about their magic, and actually learns a fair bit. However, she now has the problem of a rather terrified unicorn in her basement."
 vedina_quest.45.a:0 "Lets deal with that later"
 vedina_quest.46.t:0 "A tea party"
 vedina_quest.46.d:0 "Sköldsvärd decided to host a tea party with serveral prominent unicorn magicians. Throughout they educate and inform her about the many possibilities that unicorn magic has, as well as telling her of great tales of magical feats. Sköldsvärd is intrigued the entire afternoon, and she learns a lot about them. They can interact with the world very differently to her, and it opens her eyes up to the possibility that there may be other perspectives to problems she has not thought of herself."
 vedina_quest.46.a:0 "What a nice afternoon"
 vedina_quest.47.t:0 "The Knights Code"
 vedina_quest.47.d:0 "In order to become a fully fledged knight of Vedina the Princess must learn the Knight's Code of Vedina and know it by heart. While it is a dull task, it is a very nessesary one as there is much wisdom in its words."

 vedina_wedding.1.d:0 "Preperations for the wedding of Princess Sköldsvärd are made months in advance. Such a grand spectacle and such an important event has a lot of planning which goes into it. After all, the wedding represents so much more than the union of two people. This will be a corronation of sorts, an official recognition of Princess Sköldsvärd as future leader of Vedina. After all, there is much rumour afoot that King Wingstrom will abdicate to allow his daughter to take the throne on her wedding day. After all, she has done much to prove herself to the nobility and the knights of Vedina increasingly turn to her for guidance and support in matters of state. With the preperations underway, all that is left for Sköldsvärd is to wait."

 vedina_wedding.2.d:0 "Prince Ondska knocks on Sköldsvärd's door after dark. Highly irregular indeed for one of her ex suitors to come a knocking a few days before her wedding day. Still, even if his knocking was rather outside of royal protocal, Sköldsvärd allowed him a brief audience. Ondska was brief, he believed she wa smaking the wrong decision about her suitor choice. While that may have been true, Sköldsvärd didn't believe that. She respected Ondska of course, but he seemed... desperate, even angry.\n\nHe finished by saying that the Princess could still choose another path for Vedina. He made the point that chivalry was a lie, and that Sköldsvärd was not doing what was best for the people of Vedina. She should join him in making a new Vedina..."

 wingstrom.1.t:0 "Quest Anxiety"
 wingstrom.1.d_stage_1:0 "The local nobility are getting anxious. As every day passes the promises of Wingstrom sound hollower and hollower. They have yet to see Princess Sköldsvärd embark on her noble quest, and there are mutterings of unrest and rumours that the great king was making promises he couldn't keep.\n\nAs a result, we have lost some of our political clout in the country. In order to counteract this, the Princess should embark on her quest of heroism, or these rumours will only spin out of control."
 wingstrom.1.d_stage_2:0 "While the Princess is away, rumour continues to stir. While the nobility seem pleased that Sköldsvärd has embarked on her quest, they are eager for her to return.\n\nWingstrom does his best to assure the country that the Princess is more than capable of handling herself, but as she is a yet unproven warrior, these promises ring hollow with some. She should return soon, all the better."
 wingstrom.1.d_stage_3:0 "With the return of the Princess, the nobility is finally content that she is indeed a worthy hero of legend. Her deeds are currently being made into song by the local bards, and an Equestrian movie producer has requested the film rights to her adventures. Apparently it will make a great tv series\n\nNonetheless, the matter has now been settled."
 wingstrom.1.a:0 "I'm working on it"
 wingstrom.1.b:0 "Give her a chance"
 wingstrom.1.c:0 "I'd watch that!"
 wingstrom.2.t:0 "Cold Feet"
 wingstrom.2.d_stage_1:0 "The announcement of the Princess' quests has caused quite the stir in the country. Perhaps the most so is the announcement that Sköldsvärd will soon be available in the courting season. Yet, without an annoucement, rumours are stirring that there is a reason the annoucement has been delayed.\n\nThe tabloid newspapers have recently speculated that the Princess is even against the prospect of marriage. Scandalous indeed. Perhaps it would be best if Wingstrom presented his daughter sooner rather than later."
 wingstrom.2.d_stage_2:0 "With the announcement of the Princess' courtship, many courtiers have fallen into a frenzy of romance. So much so, it is destabilising daily court life. Unlikely candidates from far and wide have come to pledge their love for the Princess and attempt to win her for themselves.\n\nWhile none of these griffons will make any headways on the front runners, the three Princes, it has caused a bit of a nuisance for our government to sort out."
 wingstrom.2.d_stage_3:0 "Now that the Princess has chosen to marry one of her suitors, the court has settled down to a relative normality. Princess Sköldsvärd still gets the occasional mad love letter, but for now the court is pleased that the matter has been resolved. In fact, it seems they are quite eager for a wedding."

 wingstrom.4.t:0 "The Sepratist Threat"
 wingstrom.4.d:0 "They have a name, and they have a face. Rumours have been circulating in Vedina for a while now about a growing sepratist movement opposed to Princess Sköldsvärd being chosen as King Wingstrom's heir.\n\nWingstrom's spymaster informs him that Duke Fredjanik has begun to amass support in the court and has formed a significant faction within it, earning support among the more traditional Vedinan nobility.\n\nIn order to stop this, we must perform suppressive operations in order to force this faction to disperse."
 wingstrom.4.a:0 "Let us hope it comes to nothing"
 wingstrom.4.b:0 "We should make a general denouncement of this"
 wingstrom.4.c:0 "Perhaps a little reminder to the court about loyalty?"
 wingstrom.4.e:0 "Executioner!"
 wingstrom.5.t:0 "Sepratists rooted in Court"
 wingstrom.5.d:0 "Over the past few days Duke Fredjanik has been making inroads into court and he has managed to turn a good portion of the court against us. He now has a large portion of the old feudal levy on his side and poses a significant enough threat to cause us some pause. We should continue to suppress this initiative if we are not doing so already, as the duke now represents a threat to the Princess.\n\nFrom what we can tell as well, he has connections in the Griffon Empire, and possibly Socialist leanings as well. His victory will no doubt spell doom for Vedina."
 wingstrom.5.a:0 "We have our own spies, use them."
 wingstrom.5.b:0 "This is nothing to be concerned about."

 wingstrom.6.t:0 "The Sepratists Mass"
 wingstrom.6.d:0 "Deep in their lands, the marshals of known traitor counts are readying their levies and begining what looks to be war preperations. Equipment and men are being massed in key locations, and it seems they are drawing plans to strike. We have learned that they plan to upset our forces with a large array of small units in the hopes to gain encirclements. We should either prepare for the worst, or hope that our suppression efforts have been enough."
 wingstrom.6.a:0 "We must convince the court"
 wingstrom.6.b:0 "Ready our troops"

 wingstrom.7.t:0 "The Sepratist Menace"
 wingstrom.7.d_Win:0 "Thanks to the support we have granted our special task force, we have managed to gather enough evidence of sedition and treason to charge Duke Fredjanik with treason.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning, a special task group arrested him at his winter estate and he has been detained by our loyalist soldiers. He will be tried with treason, and with his arrest, the rest of the sepratists will disband or will be arrested as well."
 wingstrom.7.d_Loss:0 "Disaster has struck! Our special task force has failed to sufficiently suppress the sepratist movement, and they have now raised their flag in rebellion!\n\nDuke Fredjanik's forces have massed to the west and are well armed and well trained. Yet their divisions are spread very thinly, we may be able to win out if we concentrate our efforts and push hard against them. We should act quickly, this war will only deplete our strained resources."
