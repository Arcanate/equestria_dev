### Ideas ###
HAU_trading_crossroads:0 "The Crossroad"
HAU_trading_crossroads_desc:0 "Haukland stands as a strategic location north of the celestial sea, very literally at the crossroad between Griffonia and Equus. In the past, it has allowed Haukland to be a bridgehead for invasions between the two continents and a hotspot of piracy. After the subjugation by the Grover Dynasty, Haukland became a simple series of halfway ports between the Empire’s shores and Nova Griffonia, much to the free-minded Hauklanders' dismay. Under the leadership of Meyer, Haukland has resurrected the old crossroad toll. Ships either pay for protection, supplies or simply to get the Hauklanders off their back. Nova Griffonians, griffons of all stripes, Vedinians, Equestrians, pirates or even Communists from Stalliongrad, Meyer welcomes them all as long as they pay up. Many do. As it turns out, many ships don’t think twice faced with pirates with air support. And all this trickles back down the pockets of Meyer’s clique."
HAU_trading_crossroads_1:0 "The Crossroad"
HAU_trading_crossroads_1_desc:0 "Due to Meyer’s reforms, our situation has evolved. We no longer rely only on selling back pirate loot. Instead, we are beginning to export our own goods."
HAU_trading_crossroads_2:0 "The Crossroad"
HAU_trading_crossroads_2_desc:0 "Haukland was long simply a trade post between Equus and Griffonia. Under Meyer’s guidance, we have learned to harness the resources of the seas. Fishing and whaling are not just small subsistence activities, they are an industrialised source of revenue."
HAU_actual_industrial_base:0 "Haukland Industrieanlagen"
HAU_actual_industrial_base_desc:0 "The Meyer administration has allowed industrialization to really take off in Haukland through a combination of schemes, low taxes and loose regulations. Where we once had wet forests and desolate plains, we now have factories humming along and churning out goods for Haukland to enjoy or sell."
HAU_resource_extraction_idea:0 "The Riches of Haukland"
HAU_resource_extraction_idea_desc:0 "One needs not be a genius to know that there are bits to be made in Haukland but few knew that it was also possible to make a profit out of Haukland itself. As it turns out, Haukland’s soil and territorial waters are full of previously untapped resources. And we have a whole class of griffs and ponies who, sensing the opportunity, got to work tapping them."
HAU_enigma:0 "The Glockenreiher Code"
HAU_enigma_desc:0 "Despite all our doubts, our engineers have delivered something beyond our wildest anticipations. We have finally gained our very own system of encryption. Named after a sneaky zebrican bird, the Glockenreiher and its rotor mechanism allows us to encrypt our communications and documents in a level of sophistication never seen before. Now, we can use them at our leisure and should any enemy eyes get too curious, they would only get series of meaningless numbers and letters."
HAU_best_pilots:0 "Meyer’s New Aces"
HAU_best_pilots_desc:0 "Meyer’s Flying Aces used to be among the best pilots there were, back in 979. They were bold, young, unorthodox and innovative. But they grew older and fewer in numbers. Now, as we are investing in our Air Force, a new generation of pilots are getting ready to continue the legacy of the Aces : to be the best of the best."
HAU_flying_insititue_idea:0 "Meyer-Institut für Fortgeschrittene Luftfahrt"
HAU_flying_insititue_idea_desc:0 "The story of Hermann Meyer and his flying aces began the Imperial Airforce Academy back in Griffenheim. It is only fitting that his success is celebrated and honored in his very own academy. Those who will leave these walls will have both a modern understanding of flying tactics and knowledge and the legacy of the Flying Aces’ boldness."
HAU_piracy_idea:0 "Pirate Legacy"
HAU_piracy_idea_desc:0 "Haukland has long been a piracy hotspot, one that the Griffon Empire successfully eradicated, centuries ago. But piracy, like weeds, have a way of making a comeback. And today, once again, the pirates ships are sailing freely across the Hauklandish Isles."
HAU_absolutism:0 "Hauklandish Absolutism"
HAU_absolutism_desc:0 "Haukland under Meyer’s rule has long been a place dominated by cronies and a certain laissez-faire attitude from the Graf. Not anymore. With the same passion he has applied in the past to the restoration of the Crossroad Toll and his creation of a safe haven for piracy, Meyer has now taken the true helm of the nation at large. A new promise has been made and few have any doubts that he will once again make good on it."
HAU_army_idea:0 "Haukland Armee"
HAU_army_idea_desc:0 ""
HAU_officer_core:0 "Generalstab"
HAU_officer_core_desc:0 "The most well-armed bunch of ragtags and misfits or in other words : our officer corps. Gathered from all over the words, these adventurers and former officers have pooled their knowledge of war for Haukland to enjoy. Just don’t expect the same level of formality or discipline you’d normally expect from military officers."
HAU_smugglers_idea:0 "A Smuggler Port"
HAU_smugglers_idea_desc:0 "Every country has smugglers and strategically located islands have even more of them. Haukland is no different. However, it takes a few more steps to actually make smuggling a successful and durable activity, steps that we have taken."
HAU_successful_raid_idea:0 "Successful Raid"
HAU_successful_raid_idea_desc:0 "The pirate crews are still hungover from our last raid. We’ll have to have them sober up, refuel the ships and planes and do some repairs before we can launch another one."
HAU_raided_idea:0 "Raided By Haukland"
HAU_raided_idea_desc:0 "The Hauklanders have raided our shores. It will take some time before we can repair the damages."
HAU_take_the_hoards_idea:0 "The Hoard Tax"
HAU_take_the_hoards_idea_desc:0 "There are some simple truths in the world. One of them is that Dragons like gold and will take it. As such, they used to be a drain on the world’s gold supply. But once again, Haukland has defied common wisdom by sheer determination and a bit insanity. Now, the Dragons are paying their fair share. Well, as fair as can be when the taxpayers are fire breathing death machines."

### Focus ###
HAU_meyers_wild_ride:0 "Meyer's Fiefdom"
HAU_meyers_wild_ride_desc:0 "28 years ago, Meyer gambled and won Haukland. Ever since, he tried his hands at many schemes, always succeeding. All the while, he never forgot his comrades and partisans. And for that, he has been called the Graf of Haukland."
HAU_consolidate_rule:0 "Meet With The Old Crew"
HAU_consolidate_rule_desc:0 "Ever since the Wild Ride, the old imperial pilotes have formed the true base of Meyer’s power and the Graf’s staunchest allies. It is high time to have a reunion and to talk about things to come among friends and comrades in arms."
HAU_strenghten_authority:0 "The Claws-On Approach"
HAU_strenghten_authority_desc:0 "For years, Haukland daily affairs were left to a class of cronies while the Graf kept himself busy with other projects, only directly managing what he needed. It’s time to announce that his new pet project requires all of Haukland."
HAU_all_the_ponies:0 "All The Ponies"
HAU_all_the_ponies_desc:0 "Haukland has historically been a major refuge for adventurous ponies looking for unorthodox opportunities. Let’s remind them of some history and incite them to come to our shores."
HAU_and_the_griffons_too:0 "And The Griffons Too"
HAU_and_the_griffons_too_desc:0 "Griffonia has not fared well since the Idol of Boreas was stolen and griffons have only seen the situation deteriorate. Many of them have heard the stories of Meyer’s Wild Ride away from it all and of his successes. Let’s spread the word that our door is open. If there is one thing that will attract a griffon, it’s the promise of bits and less chances of it getting taxed."
HAU_a_couple_of_pirates:0 "Some Pirates"
HAU_a_couple_of_pirates_desc:0 "The world is full of pirates of all stripes and they always look for a safe harbour with opportunities for more plunder. It won’t be hard to attract them here, at the Crossroad."
HAU_and_some_mercenaries:0 "And The Mercenaries Too"
HAU_and_some_mercenaries_desc:0 "Mercenaries are in high demand these days. Everyone wants their services but few countries are willing to host them in peacetime due to their inherent rowdiness. We do rowdy. They’ll feel right at home here."
HAU_and_a_couple_criminals:0 "And the Criminals Of Course"
HAU_and_a_couple_criminals_desc:0 "Most countries would only see criminals as scum, probably not without reasons but in Haukland, we believe in second chances for those who are looking to reinvest themselves outside of prison. And if we can squeeze some muscles and assets in the process, all the better."
HAU_build_an_army:0 "Shall Build An Army"
HAU_build_an_army_desc:0 "Haukland has pirates, flying aces and fishergriffs. What it doesn’t have is an army. To fulfill Meyer’s plans, we will need to build one. We will have to go back to the basics, get smart and cut a lot of corners. Hopefully, we’ll have ourselves a force to be reckoned with. If not, most of our soldiers will know how to fight dirty already."
HAU_get_them_some_guns:0 "Give Them Some Rifles"
HAU_get_them_some_guns_desc:0 "Most of our new soldiers and crews still have to fight with a variety of weapons. Some of them are old guns brought back from Griffenheim during the Wild Ride and they’re not even the oldest ones in use. If we are to stand a chance, we’ll have to properly arm ourselves and not hope that our griffs bring back enough from home..."
HAU_implement_conscription:0 "And Fancy Uniforms"
HAU_implement_conscription_desc:0 "It’s high time that we give our griffs in uniforms… Well uniforms. Not that they fight in their birthday suit but our soldiers have worn a mixture of civilian clothes and uniforms from all over the world. While it’s not without a form of quaint charm, it is highly impractical."
HAU_actual_officers:0 "Acquire Some Officers"
HAU_actual_officers_desc:0 "The military in both Equus and Griffonia is known as slow-moving, rigorous and obsessive about discipline. Many competent officer end up leaving it in disgust. Most of them don’t really feel at home among bandits and adventures or worse, civilians. We can offer them a middle ground, the best of both world : personal freedom and resources to do what they do best : war."
HAU_build_a_navy:0 "Shall Build A Navy"
HAU_build_a_navy_desc:0 "Ever since Meyer allowed for the return of piracy in Haukland, we have had just enough ship to launch our naval raids. But even then, the only reason for our success is the presence of Meyer’s Flying Aces. We need to have a fleet capable of standing on their own legs. Well ships don’t have legs but you get our point."
HAU_more_pirates:0 "A Few More Pirates"
HAU_more_pirates_desc:0 "Haukland still lacks a navy but we are making some progress. To do so, we need expertise and we need ships. Fortunately, pirates have both and we have already managed to attract some."
HAU_smugglers:0 "A Couple Smugglers"
HAU_smugglers_desc:0 "Creating a navy is first and foremost about military affairs but it doesn’t mean we can’t make some bits from it. With more naval capabilities, we will be able to give some protection to smugglers and expand our operations. We already have the contacts, let’s get them on the radio. We are open for business!"
HAU_dockyards:0 "Our Very Own Dockyards"
HAU_dockyards_desc:0 "We have ships but none of them have been build here. They were all bought, stolen during the Wild Ride or in raids or broughts by the pirates and smugglers who have joined our navy. This won’t do in the future. We need to set up naval works and start building our own ships."
HAU_start_industry:0 "Shall Start Our Industry"
HAU_start_industry_desc:0 "The Empire never truly invested in Haukland, let alone helped it develop an industry. Times have changed. This is now the center of our power and we can’t rely entirely on black market, loot and imports. With the new influx of people, we’ll have the manpower and know-how to kickstart an Hauklandish industry."
HAU_electronics_experts:0 "Electronics 'Experts'"
HAU_electronics_experts_desc:0 "Despite the very limited modernisation of Haukland, the radio was adopted very early on due to the need the communicate between the islands and with the ships sailing near our shores. This has lead to the emergence of a large number of self-taught electronics users, some of them even otherwise illiterate. With some creativity, we can harness this unorthodox knowledge."
HAU_construction_scams:0 "Construction Scams"
HAU_construction_scams_desc:0 "To kickstart an industry, you need many things. One of them are factory buildings, housing and warehouses. Some of our more finance-minded advisors have concocted a scheme to promote foreign investors. They may not get the returns they’re being promised but we’ll have our buildings, even if some of them won’t be what you can call sturdy. Or safe."
HAU_first_factories:0 "Our First Factories"
HAU_first_factories_desc:0 "It hasn’t been easy but through hard work, we have finally achieved our objective of opening our first true factories. There are still many kinks to work out but overall, the Hauklandish Industry now proudly exists. We just have the small matter of making it profitable. And efficient. And safe. Well, profitable will do."
HAU_beat_the_drums:0 "Beat The Drums"
HAU_beat_the_drums_desc:0 "We are building a navy, an army and an industry. Only idiots wouldn’t understand what Meyer has in mind. But for those who are, let’s say it loud and clear : war is coming to the Crossroad. It’s time to get ready."
HAU_intellectual_refuge:0 "Foreign Intellectuals"
HAU_intellectual_refuge_desc:0 "Haukland doesn’t have much in the way of universities or scientists. But what we do have are a lax conception of budget, loose regulations and some very convincing guns. We’ll incite foreign intellectuals to come work for us, perhaps even some without a criminal record."
HAU_empire_of_the_isles:0 "The King of the Isles"
HAU_empire_of_the_isles_desc:0 "Being recognized as the Graf of Haukland had always been one of Meyer’s defining achievement but Haukland remained a small patch of islands in the northern sea. He aimed for something greater and populated by more dangerous inhabitants than pirates. No griff ever conquered the dragons. He would."
HAU_light_dragons_f:0 "Subjugate The Whelps"

HAU_heavy_dragons_f:0 "Convince The Elders"
HAU_heavy_dragons_f_desc:0 ""
HAU_dragonlord:0 "The Dragonlord"
HAU_dragonlord_desc:0 ""
HAU_crystal_mines:0 "Feed The Dragons"
HAU_crystal_mines_desc:0 "Any idiot out there knows that the first and foremost condition of stability is that the population is fed. Fail to meet this condition and there will be rebellions. While we have conquered the Dragons, we know better than to try and see what a Dragon hunger revolt looks like. We will make sure that a fair part of our crystal mining output be set aside for the Dragons to feed on."
HAU_settle_the_isles:0 "Settle The Isles"
HAU_settle_the_isles_desc:0 "The Dragon Isles have long been a forbidden place in our world, a place unfit for sentient life other than the dragons themselves. But they are not the grim place the stories tell you they are. They are vast, rich, beautiful and dangerous. And now, they are ours. If Meyer succeeded in bringing an army fit to defeat the dragons in the rainy isles of Haukland, they will come to the Dragon Isles."
HAU_take_the_hoards:0 "Tax The Dragon Hoards"
HAU_take_the_hoards_desc:0 "The Dragons are known for hoarding vast amounts of treasure for little more benefit than pride and a love of anything shiny. Treasures are something we have much more use from and we are already feeding them precious resources. The correct answer is to tax them. We could just take it all away from them but it’s always a little harder to force someone that breathes fire to just hand over the goods. Tax will do."
HAU_the_one_true_king_of_vedina:0 "Destroy Vedina"
HAU_the_one_true_king_of_vedina_desc:0 "Vedina has always been a thorn in the side of Haukland. Or maybe was it the opposite? What was sure is that out of all nations in the northern seas, the chivalrous kingdom had always been the least willing to deal with Meyer on equal term or in any sort of casual ways. It was high time to finally wipe that smugness off their faces..."
HAU_the_king_in_da_norf:0 "The King In The North"
HAU_the_king_in_da_norf_desc:0 "If there is one thing the communists in Skynavia do not like, it is monarchy. They will tell you about it. Meyer is not a griff to care much about is said about him but he certainly does not like people yelling it under his window or calling others to rise up and take what’s his. It is time to show the Skynavians the meaning and might of Hauklandish capitalism."
HAU_the_coronation:0 "The Coronation"
HAU_the_coronation_desc:0 "The Dragons fell from the sky, the Vedinan knights bent the knee and the communists finally learned their lessons. Which king or emperor can boast of any such legendary feat? And who can pride themselves in having gone so far after having started with so little? Who else than Herman Meyer? Now, the world will recognize what he deserves by might rather than birth : royalty."

HAU_branching_out:0 "Branching Out"
HAU_branching_out_desc:0 "Before now, our military has been rather limited, being composed only of our few ships and marines. However, if we wish to truly create a nation, we must branch out and establish a proper military with which to control it."
HAU_army_modernisation:0 "The Haukland Armee"
HAU_army_modernisation_desc:0 "Our army is currently nowhere near large enough to match Meyer's ambition, and must be improved and expanded to meet his demands- a true army for Haukland."
HAU_modern_rifles:0 "Modern Rifles"
HAU_modern_rifles_desc:0 "Our rifles, while not ineffective, are quite primitive compared to some foreign designs. Our new army requires new weapons to match, and so we should design more modern rifles for our soldiers."
HAU_fill_the_armouries:0 "Fill the Armouries"
HAU_fill_the_armouries_desc:0 "Our armouries lie empty, even as we need to arm more soldiers. We should do anything it takes, recovering discarded weapons, buying them in bulk and ramping up production, in order to fill our armouries and the talons of our soldiers."
HAU_paratroopers_focus:0 "Fallschirmjäger"
HAU_paratroopers_focus_desc:0 "The difficult and spread out nature of our nation causes problems both for domestic and foreign military operations. While traditionally this has been solved with the use of naval warfare, recent developments in our air force have made the creation of a specialised paratrooper unit more attractive, as an alternative to invasion and transportation by sea."
HAU_recruitment_drive:0 "Recruitment Drive"
HAU_recruitment_drive_desc:0 "No matter what efforts we take, it is impossible to build an army without soldiers to make it up. Currently our pool of new recruits is extremely lacking, and if we plan on any sort of proper military we need to remedy that with propoganda and incentives."
HAU_special_forces_drive:0 "Black Ops"
HAU_special_forces_drive_desc:0 "We- or Meyer- often may be in need of soldiers to do more secretive work; the kind of work that our common soldiers may not be disciplined or devoted enough to do. By training elite, extremely loyal troops we will have the men to carry out these operations."
HAU_doctrinal_development:0 "Doctrinal Developments"
HAU_doctrinal_development_desc:0 "Despite our military expansion and modernisation in many areas, our doctrine is still outdated- something that is only worse with our updated and larger army. To do our new forces justice we should delve into modern military theory, with the help of both domestic and foreign experts."
HAU_support_squads:0 "Radio Squads"
HAU_support_squads_desc:0 "To go with our new infantry, we need ways of communicating. We should assign radiogriffons to our divisions to help aid in communication among our soldiers, and create a more organised army."
HAU_actual_artillery:0 "The Cowitzer"
HAU_actual_artillery_desc:0 "An army cannot survive with soldiers alone- or, atleast, not thrive. As such, to support our grand army we should equip our troops with more advanced artillery guns."
HAU_anti_air_focus:0 "Guard the Skies"
HAU_anti_air_focus_desc:0 "It would by a pity for our skies to by controlled by foreigners, but we must be prepared for the threat of such happening. While our air force may be our first line of defense, if it is defeated our infantry should have an answer for our enemy's bombers- mighty anti-air guns to shoot our enemies out of the skies, and allow our soldiers defense against their barrages."
HAU_the_enigma_code_focus:0 "Adopt the Glockenreiher Code"
HAU_the_enigma_code_focus_desc:0 "Some engineers have convinced Meyer of supporting a "miracle" cipher machine, where a machine decode messages with a system using rotors and a plugboard. While it is not all it has been touted to be, it would still be a great boon to our military, and allow for more secretive operations."
HAU_paratrooper_tanks:0 "Fallschirmjäger Panzer Division"
HAU_paratrooper_tanks_desc:0 "Stories of great war machines have long intrigued Meyer, and with the development of the tank in foreign nations he has taken interest. As a counterpart to our elite Fallschirmjäger troops, our new panzer division would be our first entry into armoured warfare, and open up new opportunities for our army, as well as provide elite armoured support."

HAU_new_officers:0 "A Fresh Mindset"
HAU_new_officers_desc:0 "While we have an airforce, it is somewhat underdeveloped. If we are to take on the task of expanding our military, we need to rethink how we use our planes, and explore different doctrines."
HAU_strat_bomber_focus:0 "No Mercy"
HAU_strat_bomber_focus_desc:0 "In our new air force, we should utilise lightweight multiple use bombers- these useful planes can be used both to wreak havoc on our enemies, and to destroy their infrastructure and industry."
HAU_tact_bomber_focus:0 "Bombs For Days"
HAU_tact_bomber_focus_desc:0 "When developing more advanced bombers, we should focus on one thing above all else- destructive power. With more bombs and more powerful bombs being packed into each plane, we can rain explosive hell on our enemy's factories and soldiers."
HAU_new_airfields:0 "Connect the Islands"
HAU_new_airfields_desc:0 "Our islands are distant and difficult to travel between. While for long we have used boats to bridge this gap, with our expanding air force the opportunity for the use of air travel for transportation has also become a possibility. In order to facilitate this we must first expand our existing bases and develop one on the northern islands, to allow transportation between the two."
HAU_fighter_focus:0 "Rule the Skies"
HAU_fighter_focus_desc:0 "If we are to use our air force at all, we first must control the air. Without control of the air, our soldiers are vulnerable and our bombers easily destroyed by enemies. Fighters, therefore, should be our top priority."
HAU_heavy_fighters_focus:0 "Guard the Armee"
HAU_heavy_fighters_focus_desc:0 "While normal fighter aircraft work fine, when it comes to defending our airspace from superior enemies, we do not need the range they offer- range that could be traded for superior weaponry and armor. By sacrificing some aspects for superior control of the air space they can reach, while we may not go far from our islands we can control them better."
HAU_doctrinal_development_air:0 "Proper Training"
HAU_doctrinal_development_air_desc:0 "Our air force is expanding, and with the production of new planes comes the need for new pilots. While we have been rudimentally training them, it has proven ineffective, and should be reformed both to promote more thought on air doctrine and improve the ability of our pilots."
HAU_CAS_focus:0 "Support the Armee"
HAU_CAS_focus_desc:0 "Wars are not won with air alone, and as such air power should be focused on supporting our operations on the ground. To do so we need to develop aircraft able to engage ground targets with precision attacks, something a specialised close air support craft would do finely."
HAU_napalm:0 "Napalm"
HAU_napalm_desc:0 "With our air fleet growing larger in numbers, and especially with our focus on close air support and bombing, the use of alternative weaponry has crossed the minds of some- and has reached Meyer, who has approved the use of napalm, a petrochemical and jelly compound which is highly flammable and destructive, perfect for use by our bombers."
HAU_rocket_projects:0 "Hauklandian Rocketry"
HAU_rocket_projects_desc:0 "Meyer's interest in rocketry is not new, however, before our air force was properly developed it was but a dream. Despite our still low resources, our leader has ordered research into rocket technology which he believes to be the future of warfare. Whether he is right or not is yet to be seen, but these investments will allow us to develop technologies few others have."
HAU_the_best_of_the_best:0 "The Best of the Best"
HAU_the_best_of_the_best_desc:0 "It is the belief of some that only the most elite should be allowed in the air force- which is considered by some to have a higher quality of life than other branches. By promoting this attitude and enforcing tighter standards we can ensure that our airgriffons are well-trained and disciplined, above the rest."
HAU_flying_institute:0 "The Meyer Institute of Aviation"
HAU_flying_institute_desc:0 "Our focus on elite pilots and rapid development of more advanced technologies and doctrine has culminated in the opening of a university for pilots, mandated by Meyer himself- the aptly named Meyer Institute of Aviation. All pilots are to go through special training in this school, training them in both pilotting and how to fly at night."

HAU_reinforce_the_navy:0 "Reinforce the Kriegsmarine"
HAU_reinforce_the_navy_desc:0 "The sea divides our country, and therefore controlling it is necessary to control our nation in its entirety- and yet, our navy is small and outdated, a sad display. We must quickly remedy this if we are to maintain control of our nation, and to have the possibility to stage operations abroad."
HAU_naval_aviation:0 "Naval Aviation"
HAU_naval_aviation_desc:0 "The idea of aerial and naval warfare meeting has become more likely as technology develops around the world, and Haukland will not be left beyond. We need to develop naval bombing planes, both as a supplement for our navy and for possible use in future carriers."
HAU_carrier_efforts:0 "Carrier Experiments"
HAU_carrier_efforts_desc:0 "Like many new ideas, Meyer has taken a liking to carriers. As such, he has ordered for experiments to be done, with model carriers being designed based on old battleships with altered designs, as well as some entirely new designs being proposed."
HAU_new_marines:0 "Reinforce the Marineinfanterist"
HAU_new_marines_desc:0 "To control the sea with a navy is one thing, but to do so with both your navy and army is another. Our nation has a history of a strong marine corps, due to our island nature, and this should be promoted as we shift focus back to our navy."
HAU_winterhold_base:0 "The Winterhold Base"
HAU_winterhold_base_desc:0 "Winterhold, the most important city on the northern islands, already has a substantial naval base. However, to better connect the ideas and allow more ships to dock for coastal operations, we should expand it more."
HAU_haukland_base:0 "The Haukland Base"
HAU_haukland_base_desc:0 "The naval base in our capital, Haukhamn, should be expanded. With our navy growing larger, we need a centrally located naval base for our ships to operate out of on blue-water operations, and our capital allows both that and for our ships to be closer to civilian and industrial centers."
HAU_transport_craft:0 "Landungsboot"
HAU_transport_craft_desc:0 "Despite our many marines, we still have relatively unimpressive and ineffective landing craft. If we are to use our marines to their fullest ability, we need better landing craft for them to use."
HAU_destroyer_focus:0 "Patrol Ships"
HAU_destroyer_focus_desc:0 "To control the seas between our islands, we need destroyers to patrol them and maintain a constant presence. While our current designs suit us fine, we should develop superior ones to better maintain a presence in our seas."

HAU_submarine_focus_desc:0 "The development of the unterseeboot, shortened by some to U-Boot, has fascinated many and is thought of as a sound investment. While these crafts are not especially effective at controlling the sea, they can easily disrupt enemy supplies at sea and attack with surprise and with strong firepower."
HAU_guard_the_carriers:0 "Guarding Our Carriers"
HAU_guard_the_carriers_desc:0 "To keep our new carriers above water, we need escorts. While smaller boats are not effective at this, cruisers are the perfect median to use for guarding our larger carriers, with little defense of their own."
HAU_loot_the_ships:0 "A Legacy of Piracy"
HAU_loot_the_ships_desc:0 "Our coasts have long been havens for pirates, a tradition that is reflected in our navy. Rather than trying to wipe this out, we can embrace it, using tactics from the old pirates in our U-Boat raids and sailing."
HAU_a_grand_flagship:0 "A Grand Flagship"
HAU_a_grand_flagship_desc:0 "With our navy expanded, we need a ship to rally around- and what better than a grand battleship to guide our navy? A mighty ship made with the latest technologies will both garner more public support for our navy and improve morale for sailors, while being a strong presence at sea as well."

haukland.6.t:0 "The Mad And The Ambitious"
haukland.6.d:0 "Twenty eight years ago, Meyer convinced a large part of the Imperial Airforce to let Republicans and Imperials settle their affairs and leave for adventure. And off they were. They settled in Haukland, declaring it their very own free state. Few outsiders thoughts they would last. Kemerskai swore to get back at Meyer but he never did. The Imperial Regency swore they would crush them but they never did. The Equestrians even sent letters inviting Meyer to negotiate and restore stability to the region. But Haukland stayed.\n\nThen Meyer decided to try his hands at piracy. His pilots were bored and followed him wholeheartedly. The locals too. And there you had it. The ancestral crossroad toll had been restored. Each ship had to pay up or enjoy chatting with the fish. It was all pretty straightforward. Nova Griffonians enraged but they paid up. The Empire couldn’t do anything on the account of having their fleet - and airforce of course - stolen but they did complain. The skyfallian thieves complained too but eventually concluded that paying was cheaper than trying to run a full imperial navy on a city state budget. And so they did. The Equestrians again sent very strongly worded letters. Sharply written too. Meyer hanged them in his office. And so the Crossroad Toll was restored.\n\nAnd so, there they were. Meyer had fulfilled his promises to his pilotes and to the locals. Haukland was prospering. Well, as much as they could. Money was flowing. People around eventually grew accustomed to their presence, like a cold rain or an annoying neighbours. They even found out that Hauklanders were very open-minded once you had paid up. Something that many ill-considered nations like Stalliongrad, Skynavia or the Republic discovered to be a useful asset. The Equestrians even stopped sending letters.\n\nMany said Meyer would have to go but he was still there and he wasn’t going anywhere anytime soon."
haukland.6.a:0 "Long live the Graf!"

haukland.7.t:0 "The Speech"
haukland.7.d:0 "Herman Meyer gathered his supporters and friends in the closest place Haukland had to a parliament : the Haukland Airfield pilots’ bar. He looked around the place fondly, reminded of his time at the old academy, back in Griffenheim. Many old faces, most of them had joined him on the Wild Ride in 979. Without them all, Haukland wouldn’t be Haukland. He took his place on the stage as eyes were turning towards him.\n\n“Dear friends. Welcome to you all. There’s no place I’d rather be in this world than drinking until morning hours with all of you.” Some raised their glasses to that and cheered. Meyer raised his glass accordingly and drank.\n\nMeyer spoke of simpler times. Times when a few plucky revolutionary pilots broke free from Kermaskai and forged their own destiny. Like the time Hans stole a flag from an Equestrian battleship, or when Jane ransomed a Skyfall Oligarch's son, only for him to propose after they paid up. Griffons nodded, laughing, yelling to add lurid details or howl in mock outrage. But there was a certain sadness behind it all - a nostalgia for times past. Meyer sensed the shift, and stared them down...\n\n“Yes. We truly had fun. But we’re not getting any younger, are we? We’ve realized all of our youth dreams and then some but is it enough? I know lots of you have children. Some even who know you! Isn’t it time we get some real money to leave them? Isn’t time we think about our legacy? I say we get out there and show all these idiots out there that the Meyer Flying Aces are a legend! One that will make Grover’s sound like the story of a rainy picnic! Are you with me?!”\n\nSeveral of the pilots bursted into cheers, spilling beer and whiskey all over while chanting. It took only a few seconds for all of the bar to cheer along. Meyer smiled. They were off to one final wild ride. One for the ages!"
haukland.7.a:0 "Meyer! Meyer! Meyer!"


haukland.8.t:0 "The Graf's Rule"
haukland.8.d:0 "For years now, Hauklanders have enjoyed some degree of autonomy. No one could really question Meyer’s grasp on power but the Graf always let a certain form of laissez-faire in the way the islands were ruled. Some, well outside Haukland, saw it as a proof of Meyer’s weak rule but the locals knew better. Meyer’s rule was ad hoc. When he set his sights on an issue, all are to obey. As for the rest, he was happy to appoint others and let them line their own pockets administrating things for him as long as things were getting done. In the end, it was nothing more than dilettante rule.\n\nBut now, the situation has changed. The Ace of Haukland had now bigger plans and for them to be enacted, he needed control. Many of the old hauklander cronies were removed from their positions. In several cases, the move was openly supported by the locals frustrated by the cronies and who welcomed Meyer’s rule. In most of Haukland, the rule was simply acknowledged without much fuss. And if some unfortunate accidents happen in the upcoming weeks to those who opposed Meyer, well… It was Haukland after all."

haukland.14.d:0 "The raiding party we sent out returned with a full cargo of loot. Their mediocre navy and police forces were incapable to stop the Hauklandish tactic. Our lads plundered the coastal towns out of everything of value not nailed down to the floor while our planes patrolled over the town. They made it out of there before the land forces could arrive.\n\nAs always, the loot has been sold in Haukland’s black market and the benefits shared between the pirates, the support crew and of course, Meyer himself."

There are several deaths reported and many more wounded.\n\nIn light of this defeat, there have been many calls to restructure and bolster our naval capabilities. Only superior strength will keep the Hauklandish pirates at bay."
haukland.15.a:0 "Damn you, Meyer!"

haukland.16.t:0 "Failed Naval Raid"
haukland.16.d:0 "The raiding party we sent out returned bare clawed. Despite our superior tactics, the local forces managed to keep us from landing. Combat was brutal and cost us dearly. In the end, our pirates were repulsed. Pushing any further would have cost us more than the loot could pay back for and so the attack was called off.\n\nMemorial parties were held in the port’s bars in the honour of those who died out there and couldn’t be brought back. They drank in their name. At least, the bartenders made a profit from all this."
haukland.16.a:0 "Can’t win them all."
