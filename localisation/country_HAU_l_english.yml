HAU_trading_crossroads:0 "The Crossroad"
HAU_trading_crossroads_desc:0 "Haukland stands as a strategic location north of the celestial sea, very literally at the crossroad between Griffonia and Equus. In the past, it has allowed Haukland to be a bridgehead for invasions between the two continents and a hotspot of piracy. After the subjugation by the Grover Dynasty, Haukland became a simple series of halfway ports between the Empire’s shores and Nova Griffonia, much to the free-minded Hauklanders' dismay. Under the leadership of Meyer, Haukland has resurrected the old crossroad toll. Ships either pay for protection, supplies or simply to get the Hauklanders off their back. Nova Griffonians, griffons of all stripes, Vedinians, Equestrians, pirates or even Communists from Stalliongrad, Meyer welcomes them all as long as they pay up. Many do. As it turns out, many ships don’t think twice faced with pirates with air support. And all this trickles back down the pockets of Meyer’s clique."

With the same passion he has applied in the past to the restoration of the Crossroad Toll and his creation of a safe haven for piracy, Meyer has now taken the true helm of the nation at large.

HAU_meyers_wild_ride_desc:0 "28 years ago, Meyer gambled and won Haukland. Ever since, he tried his hands at many schemes, always succeeding. All the while, he never forgot his comrades and partisans. And for that, he has been called the Graf of Haukland."
HAU_consolidate_rule:0 "Meet With the Old Crew"

HAU_branching_out_desc:0 "Before now, our military has been rather limited, being composed only of our few ships and marines. However, if we wish to truly create a nation, we must branch out and establish a proper military with which to control it."
HAU_army_modernisation:0 "The Haukland Armee"
HAU_army_modernisation_desc:0 "Our army is currently nowhere near large enough to match Meyer's ambition, and must be improved and expanded to meet his demands- a true army for Haukland."
HAU_modern_rifles:0 "Modern Rifles"
HAU_modern_rifles_desc:0 "Our rifles, while not ineffective, are quite primitive compared to some foreign designs. Our new army requires new weapons to match, and so we should design more modern rifles for our soldiers."
HAU_fill_the_armouries:0 "Fill the Armouries"
HAU_fill_the_armouries_desc:0 "Our armouries lie empty, even as we need to arm more soldiers. We should do anything it takes, recovering discarded weapons, buying them in bulk and ramping up production, in order to fill our armouries and the talons of our soldiers."
HAU_paratroopers_focus:0 "Fallschirmjäger"
HAU_paratroopers_focus_desc:0 "The difficult and spread out nature of our nation causes problems both for domestic and foreign military operations. While traditionally this has been solved with the use of naval warfare, recent developments in our air force have made the creation of a specialised paratrooper unit more attractive, as an alternative to invasion and transportation by sea."
HAU_recruitment_drive:0 "Recruitment Drive"
HAU_recruitment_drive_desc:0 "No matter what efforts we take, it is impossible to build an army without soldiers to make it up. Currently our pool of new recruits is extremely lacking, and if we plan on any sort of proper military we need to remedy that with propoganda and incentives."
HAU_special_forces_drive:0 "Black Ops"
HAU_special_forces_drive_desc:0 "We- or Meyer- often may be in need of soldiers to do more secretive work; the kind of work that our common soldiers may not be disciplined or devoted enough to do. By training elite, extremely loyal troops we will have the men to carry out these operations."
HAU_doctrinal_development:0 "Doctrinal Developments"
HAU_doctrinal_development_desc:0 "Despite our military expansion and modernisation in many areas, our doctrine is still outdated- something that is only worse with our updated and larger army. To do our new forces justice we should delve into modern military theory, with the help of both domestic and foreign experts."
HAU_support_squads:0 "Radio Squads"
HAU_support_squads_desc:0 "To go with our new infantry, we need ways of communicating. We should assign radiogriffons to our divisions to help aid in communication among our soldiers, and create a more organised army."
HAU_actual_artillery:0 "The Cowitzer"
HAU_actual_artillery_desc:0 "An army cannot survive with soldiers alone- or, atleast, not thrive. As such, to support our grand army we should equip our troops with more advanced artillery guns."
HAU_anti_air_focus:0 "Guard the Skies"
HAU_anti_air_focus_desc:0 "It would by a pity for our skies to by controlled by foreigners, but we must be prepared for the threat of such happening. While our air force may be our first line of defense, if it is defeated our infantry should have an answer for our enemy's bombers- mighty anti-air guns to shoot our enemies out of the skies, and allow our soldiers defense against their barrages."
HAU_the_enigma_code_focus:0 "Adopt the Enigma Code"
HAU_the_enigma_code_focus_desc:0 "Some engineers have convinced Meyer of supporting a "miracle" cipher machine, where a machine decode messages with a system using rotors and a plugboard. While it is not all it has been touted to be, it would still be a great boon to our military, and allow for more secretive operations."
HAU_paratrooper_tanks:0 "Fallschirmjäger Panzer Division"
HAU_paratrooper_tanks_desc:0 "Stories of great war machines have long intrigued Meyer, and with the development of the tank in foreign nations he has taken interest. As a counterpart to our elite Fallschirmjäger troops, our new panzer division would be our first entry into armoured warfare, and open up new opportunities for our army, as well as provide elite armoured support."

HAU_new_officers:0 "A Fresh Mindset"
HAU_new_officers_desc:0 "While we have an airforce, it is somewhat underdeveloped. If we are to take on the task of expanding our military, we need to rethink how we use our planes, and explore different doctrines."
HAU_strat_bomber_focus:0 "No Mercy"
HAU_strat_bomber_focus_desc:0 "In our new air force, we should utilise lightweight multiple use bombers- these useful planes can be used both to wreak havoc on our enemies, and to destroy their infrastructure and industry."
HAU_tact_bomber_focus:0 "Bombs For Days"
HAU_tact_bomber_focus_desc:0 "When developing more advanced bombers, we should focus on one thing above all else- destructive power. With more bombs and more powerful bombs being packed into each plane, we can rain explosive hell on our enemy's factories and soldiers."
HAU_new_airfields:0 "Connect the Islands"
HAU_new_airfields_desc:0 "Our islands are distant and difficult to travel between. While for long we have used boats to bridge this gap, with our expanding air force the opportunity for the use of air travel for transportation has also become a possibility. In order to facilitate this we must first expand our existing bases and develop one on the northern islands, to allow transportation between the two."
HAU_fighter_focus:0 "Rule the Skies"
HAU_fighter_focus_desc:0 "If we are to use our air force at all, we first must control the air. Without control of the air, our soldiers are vulnerable and our bombers easily destroyed by enemies. Fighters, therefore, should be our top priority."
HAU_heavy_fighters_focus:0 "Guard the Armee"
HAU_heavy_fighters_focus_desc:0 "While normal fighter aircraft work fine, when it comes to defending our airspace from superior enemies, we do not need the range they offer- range that could be traded for superior weaponry and armor. By sacrificing some aspects for superior control of the air space they can reach, while we may not go far from our islands we can control them better."
HAU_doctrinal_development_air:0 "Proper Training"
HAU_doctrinal_development_air_desc:0 "Our air force is expanding, and with the production of new planes comes the need for new pilots. While we have been rudimentally training them, it has proven ineffective, and should be reformed both to promote more thought on air doctrine and improve the ability of our pilots."
HAU_CAS_focus:0 "Support the Armee"
HAU_CAS_focus_desc:0 "Wars are not won with air alone, and as such air power should be focused on supporting our operations on the ground. To do so we need to develop aircraft able to engage ground targets with precision attacks, something a specialised close air support craft would do finely."
HAU_napalm:0 "Napalm"
HAU_napalm_desc:0 "With our air fleet growing larger in numbers, and especially with our focus on close air support and bombing, the use of alternative weaponry has crossed the minds of some- and has reached Meyer, who has approved the use of napalm, a petrochemical and jelly compound which is highly flammable and destructive, perfect for use by our bombers."
HAU_rocket_projects:0 "Hauklandian Rocketry"
HAU_rocket_projects_desc:0 "Meyer's interest in rocketry is not new, however, before our air force was properly developed it was but a dream. Despite our still low resources, our leader has ordered research into rocket technology which he believes to be the future of warfare. Whether he is right or not is yet to be seen, but these investments will allow us to develop technologies few others have."
HAU_the_best_of_the_best:0 "The Best of the Best"
HAU_the_best_of_the_best_desc:0 "It is the belief of some that only the most elite should be allowed in the air force- which is considered by some to have a higher quality of life than other branches. By promoting this attitude and enforcing tighter standards we can ensure that our airgriffons are well-trained and disciplined, above the rest."
HAU_flying_institute:0 "The Meyer Institute of Aviation"
HAU_flying_institute_desc:0 "Our focus on elite pilots and rapid development of more advanced technologies and doctrine has culminated in the opening of a university for pilots, mandated by Meyer himself- the aptly named Meyer Institute of Aviation. All pilots are to go through special training in this school, training them in both pilotting and how to fly at night."

HAU_reinforce_the_navy:0 "Reinforce the Kriegsmarine"
HAU_reinforce_the_navy_desc:0 "The sea divides our country, and therefore controlling it is necessary to control our nation in its entirety- and yet, our navy is small and outdated, a sad display. We must quickly remedy this if we are to maintain control of our nation, and to have the possibility to stage operations abroad."
HAU_naval_aviation:0 "Naval Aviation"
HAU_naval_aviation_desc:0 "The idea of aerial and naval warfare meeting has become more likely as technology develops around the world, and Haukland will not be left beyond. We need to develop naval bombing planes, both as a supplement for our navy and for possible use in future carriers."
HAU_carrier_efforts:0 "Carrier Experiments"
HAU_carrier_efforts_desc:0 "Like many new ideas, Meyer has taken a liking to carriers. As such, he has ordered for experiments to be done, with model carriers being designed based on old battleships with altered designs, as well as some entirely new designs being proposed."
HAU_new_marines:0 "Reinforce the Marineinfanterist"
HAU_new_marines_desc:0 "To control the sea with a navy is one thing, but to do so with both your navy and army is another. Our nation has a history of a strong marine corps, due to our island nature, and this should be promoted as we shift focus back to our navy."
HAU_winterhold_base:0 "The Winterhold Base"
HAU_winterhold_base_desc:0 "Winterhold, the most important city on the northern islands, already has a substantial naval base. However, to better connect the ideas and allow more ships to dock for coastal operations, we should expand it more."
HAU_haukland_base:0 "The Haukland Base"
HAU_haukland_base_desc:0 "The naval base in our capital, Haukhamn, should be expanded. With our navy growing larger, we need a centrally located naval base for our ships to operate out of on blue-water operations, and our capital allows both that and for our ships to be closer to civilian and industrial centers."
HAU_transport_craft:0 "Landungsboot"
HAU_transport_craft_desc:0 "Despite our many marines, we still have relatively unimpressive and ineffective landing craft. If we are to use our marines to their fullest ability, we need better landing craft for them to use."
HAU_destroyer_focus:0 "Patrol Ships"
HAU_destroyer_focus_desc:0 "To control the seas between our islands, we need destroyers to patrol them and maintain a constant presence. While our current designs suit us fine, we should develop superior ones to better maintain a presence in our seas."
HAU_submarine_focus:0 "U-Boat Experiments"
HAU_submarine_focus_desc:0 "The development of the unterseeboot, shortened by some to U-Boot, has fascinated many and is thought of as a sound investment. While these crafts are not especially effective at controlling the sea, they can easily disrupt enemy supplies at sea and attack with surprise and with strong firepower."
HAU_guard_the_carriers:0 "Guarding Our Carriers"
HAU_guard_the_carriers_desc:0 "To keep our new carriers above water, we need escorts. While smaller boats are not effective at this, cruisers are the perfect median to use for guarding our larger carriers, with little defense of their own."
HAU_loot_the_ships:0 "A Legacy of Piracy"
HAU_loot_the_ships_desc:0 "Our coasts have long been havens for pirates, a tradition that is reflected in our navy. Rather than trying to wipe this out, we can embrace it, using tactics from the old pirates in our U-Boat raids and sailing."
HAU_a_grand_flagship:0 "A Grand Flagship"
HAU_a_grand_flagship_desc:0 "With our navy expanded, we need a ship to rally around- and what better than a grand battleship to guide our navy? A mighty ship made with the latest technologies will both garner more public support for our navy and improve morale for sailors, while being a strong presence at sea as well."

haukland.6.t:0 "The Mad And The Ambitious"
haukland.6.d:0 "Twenty eight years ago, Meyer convinced a large part of the Imperial Airforce to let Republicans and Imperials settle their affairs and leave for adventure. And off they were. They settled in Haukland, declaring it their very own free state. Few outsiders thoughts they would last. Kemerskai swore to get back at Meyer but he never did. The Imperial Regency swore they would crush them but they never did. The Equestrians even sent letters inviting Meyer to negotiate and restore stability to the region. But Haukland stayed.\n\nThen Meyer decided to try his hands at piracy. His pilots were bored and followed him wholeheartedly. The locals too. And there you had it. The ancestral crossroad toll had been restored. Each ship had to pay up or enjoy chatting with the fish. It was all pretty straightforward. Nova Griffonians enraged but they paid up. The Empire couldn’t do anything on the account of having their fleet - and airforce of course - stolen but they did complain. The skyfallian thieves complained too but eventually concluded that paying was cheaper than trying to run a full imperial navy on a city state budget. And so they did. The Equestrians again sent very strongly worded letters. Sharply written too. Meyer hanged them in his office. And so the Crossroad Toll was restored.\n\nAnd so, there they were. Meyer had fulfilled his promises to his pilotes and to the locals. Haukland was prospering. Well, as much as they could. Money was flowing. People around eventually grew accustomed to their presence, like a cold rain or an annoying neighbours. They even found out that Hauklanders were very open-minded once you had paid up. Something that many ill-considered nations like Stalliongrad, Skynavia or the Republic discovered to be a useful asset. The Equestrians even stopped sending letters.\n\nMany said Meyer would have to go but he was still there and he wasn’t going anywhere anytime soon."
haukland.6.a:0 "Long live the Graf!"

haukland.7.t:0 "The Speech"
haukland.7.d:0 "Herman Meyer gathered his supporters and friends in the closest place Haukland had to a parliament : the Haukland Airfield pilots bar. He had a fondness for this place. It reminded him of the old Air Academy, back in Griffenheim. He looked around. Many old faces, most of them had joined him on the Wild Ride in 979. Without them all, Haukland wouldn’t be Haukland. He took his place on the stage as eyes were turning towards him.\n\n“Dear friends. Welcome to you all. There’s no place I’d rather be in this world than drinking until morning hours with all of you.” Some raised their glasses to that and cheered. Meyer raised his glass accordingly and drank.\n\n“We’ve come a long way, haven’t we. I still remember when we were a bunch of pilot cadets thrust at the forefront during the Revolution and the day we left that Kemerskai idiot and flied away into the sunset. And then… Haukland. Ah how much fun we’ve had since. Hans, remember when you stole that equestrian battleship’s flag from your cockpit? What about you, Jane? When you ransomed that Skyfall oligarch’s son only to get him to propose to you after daddy paid up?” He laughed and went on to exchange some old memories for a moment. The assistance smiled and laughed along.\n\n“Yes. We truly had fun. But we’re not getting any younger, are we? We’ve realized all of our youth dreams and then some but is it enough? I know lots of you have children. Some even who knows you! Isn’t it time we get some real money to leave them? Isn’t time we think about our legacy? I say we get out there and show all these idiots out there that the Meyer Flying Aces are a legend ! One that will make Grover’s sound like the story of a rainy picnic! Are you with me?!”\n\nSeveral of the pilots bursted into cheers, spilling beer and whiskey all over while chanting. It took only a few seconds for all of the bar to cheer along. Meyer smiled. They were off to one finale wild ride. One for the ages !"
haukland.7.a:0 "Meyer! Meyer! Meyer!"


haukland.8.t:0 "The Graf's Rule"
haukland.8.d:0 "For years now, Hauklanders have enjoyed some degree of autonomy. No one could really question Meyer’s grasp on power but the Graf always let a certain form of laissez-faire in the way the islands were ruled. Some, well outside Haukland, saw it as a proof of Meyer’s weak rule but the locals knew better. Meyer’s rule was ad hoc. When he set his sights on an issue, all are to obey. As for the rest, he was happy to appoint others and let them line their own pockets administrating things for him as long as things were getting done. In the end, it was nothing more than dilettante rule.\n\nBut now, the situation has changed. The Ace of Haukland had now bigger plans and for them to be enacted, he needed control. Many of the old hauklander cronies were removed from their positions. In several cases, the move was openly supported by the locals frustrated by the cronies and who welcomed Meyer’s rule. In most of Haukland, the rule was simply acknowledged without much fuss. And if some unfortunate accidents happen in the upcoming weeks to those who opposed Meyer, well… It was Haukland after all."
