 equestria.139.t:0 "Issue of conscription"
 equestria.139.d:0 "Since Equestria has not been touched by war in centuries, drafting ponies into military was never necessary. However, with growing threat on horizon, some politicians have proposed to institute a draft to better prepare our country for the coming storm."
 equestria.139.a:0 "Nonsense, peace will prevail."
 equestria.139.b:0 "A limited draft shall suffice."
 equestria.139.c:0 "We have to be prepared for anything - institute extensive conscription."

 equestria.140.t:0 "Economic focus"
 equestria.140.d:0 "Equestrian economy has great potential, however right now it is focused on providing goods and services for the ponies - as it has for decades. That being said, it might be prudent to start focusing on defence and heavy industries - to safeguard our nation in a changing world."
 equestria.140.a:0 "There is no reason to interfere in the market."
 equestria.140.b:0 "We shall prepare for economic mobilization."
 equestria.140.b.tp:0 "Can now change §YEconomic Laws§W"

 equestria.141.t:0 "Conscription crisis"
 equestria.141.d:0 "Groups of conscientious objectors and pacifists have been trying to dodge the draft since the beginning of the war, but today, the situation has reached the breaking point. Large amounts of ponies are determined to avoid being sent to the front. If this situation is left alone, it may lead to serious ponypower shortages."
 equestria.141.a:0 "It is their right to protest."
 equestria.141.b:0 "Everypony needs to fight."
 equestria.141.c:0 "Crack down on them so hard they won't think of dodging draft again!"

 equestria.142.t:0 "Anti-war publications"
 equestria.142.d_defense:0 "With our army on the defensive, some of the leading national publications have started to print defeatist messages, undermining the will of our ponies to fight. Freedom of press is one of the tenents of Equestrian society - but perhaps it is time for extraordinary measures?"
 equestria.142.d_off:0 "With our army bravely fighting the enemy, some of the leading national publications have started to print pacifist messages, urging to end the war immediately. This, of course, doesn't help the war effort. Freedom of press is one of the tenents of Equestrian society - but perhaps it is time for extraordinary measures?"
 equestria.142.a:0 "The media cannot be shackled."
 equestria.142.b:0 "Institute emergency war-time censorship."

 equestria.143.t:0 "Princess Celestia's Speech"
 equestria.143.d:0 "In this grave hour, perhaps the most fateful in our history, I send to every household of my ponies, both at home and overseas, this message, spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold and speak to you myself. For the first time in centuries, we are at war. Over and over again, we have tried to find a peaceful way out of the differences between ourselves and those who are now our enemies; but it has been in vain."
 equestria.143.a:0 "We have been forced into a conflict we have not wanted."
 equestria.143.b:0 "I, as the Princess of Equestria, will do everything in my power to protect my little ponies."
 equestria.143.c:0 "[CHN.GetLeader] will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen!"

 equestria.144.t:0 "The times are changing"
 equestria.144.d:0 "Since times immemorable, ponies have been a peaceful race, with the Magic of Friendship able to solve all problems that might have befallen then. Unfortunately, it seems that this world is coming to an end. Can Magic of Friendship still survive when Equestria is under attack?"
 equestria.144.a:0 "After this war, we will go back to our peaceful ways."
 equestria.144.b:0 "The times have changed, and we must adapt."
 equestria.144.c:0 "I need to do everything to keep my ponies safe - whether they like it, or not."

 equestria.147.t:0 "Wartime Press Act"
 equestria.147.d:0 "Freedom of press is a founding block of Equestrian society - but, as some nobles and politicians have suggested, in desperate times like these, it might be wise to impose limitations on speech that will help the war effort."
 equestria.147.a:0 "We cannot deny our citizens a basic freedom, even in war."
 equestria.147.b:0 "Slight censorship will get the job done."
 equestria.147.c:0 "No more - they will write what I tell them to write."

 equestria.148.t:0 "Martial law"
 equestria.148.d:0 "We are in a state of war. Peacetime laws, while preserving the liberties of ponies, are becoming a hindrance in these desperate times. Will due process be another victim of the war?"
 equestria.148.a:0 "[Root.GetName] is a harmonic society, war or not."
 equestria.148.b:0 "Martial law has to be instituted."
 equestria.148.c:0 "In order to defend [Root.GetName], laws have to be changed."

 equestria.151.t:0 "Wartime administration"
 equestria.151.d:0 "As war drags on, the civilian administration has shown to be completely unadjusted to the harsh realities of warfare. We may militarize the administration and local governments to help the war effort and calm the home front."
 equestria.151.a:0 "Reforms of civilian administration will suffice."
 equestria.151.b:0 "Military will join civilians for the time of war."
 equestria.151.c:0 "They have shown to be incompetent and unable to protect Equestria."

 equestria.152.t:0 "War Plan"
 equestria.152.d:0 "A comprehensive plan has been prepared in order to fully mobilize the entire society in defense of [Root.GetName]. That being said, the War Plan, as it began to be called, may lead to considerable hardships for our ponies."
 equestria.152.a:0 "The plan doesn't need to be as demanding."
 equestria.152.b:0 "Unfortunate, but necessary. Implement the War Plan."
 equestria.152.c:0 "Young, old, colt, mare - all shall fight - either on the front, or at home."

 equestria.153.t:0 "Concers about Celestia"
 equestria.153.d_luna:0 "Sister, you have become... colder. I am worried about you. You are not who you used to be - your gentle smile and optimism, gone. I know how hard it is to rule, especially now, but some of the measures you have enacted hurt our ponies, not protect them. Please, sister, stop for a while and think about this."
 equestria.153.d_nobles:0 "Your Majesty, we couldn't help but notice that you, please pardon the term, seem different that before. The policies you have enacted, while of course necessary, have been considered extreme by some. Perhaps Your Majesty could reconsider some of the details?"
 equestria.153.b:0 "I am perfectly fine. Do not bother me again."
 equestria.153.a:0 "Perhaps you are right - it seems I had lost myself..."

 equestria.154.t:0 "Supernova"
 equestria.154.d_war:0 "The enemy is on the horizon, relentlessly pushing towards complete and utter destruction of Harmony and Equestria. I had been too complacent, too weak to protect my ponies. But now, I see the error of my ways. I will stop at nothing until the enemies of Harmony are ashes and dust. I shall become what I was always destined to be!"
 equestria.154.d_nowar:0 "Surrounded by enemies, both internal and external, the Harmony is in danger. My ponies need to be protected from them, even if they don't yet see the danger. I had been too complacent, too weak - but now, I see the error of my ways. I will stop at nothing until the enemies of Harmony are ashes and dust. I shall become what I was always destined to be!"
 equestria.154.a:0 "Harmony through Order. Peace throught Strength."
 equestria.154.a.tp:0 "Become §YDaybreaker§W\n"
 equestria.154.b:0 "Wait, what am I doing? Those aren't my thoughts, I am not like this!"
 equestria.154.c:0 "They will know the power of the Sun!"

 equestria.157.t:0 "Supernova"
 equestria.157.d:0 "No. This §Yis§W me now. This is what I have become. I am the ruler of Equestria, I am the Sun incarnate, I am a god amongst weak and unfit to rule! I am Daybreaker!"
 equestria.157.a:0 "§YSol Invicta!§W"

I am to make the Crystal Empire bend it's knee to it’s true, Solar Rulers- by whatever means necessary...\n\nMy only hope is that Shining and Cadence are reasonable in the face of the new regime; that they can be brought to see Daybreaker’s light as I have. But, if they cannot... well...\n\nThat's why I am going, after all. I slid open my closet door with a quick and simple spell, and gazed at the three sets of clothing in the direct center. Daybreaker had given me the mission, and I'd given myself three options. Making my choice, I levitated my selection out of the closet to dress in. I'd go as..."

 solarempiresparkles.2.t:0 "Arrival"
 solarempiresparkles.2.d:0 "I gazed about the train car as it ground to a halt, Griffon-made Kolibri pistol hidden and tucked securely within my rags. For a brief moment, my eyes met a batpony across from me- one of the very few that had seen my Empress’ light. The barely a pony looked away from my superiority after a brief moment, though his gaze did betray his worry. Scorecard, I’d been told his name was. Not that I cared, much. Still, I had to at least pay some attention, if they were going to be successful.\n\nThe station itself was bustling with activity, though I, Sunrise Sparkle, ignored all of that. Instead, I looked for my quarry- an Crystal Guard. Mindful of the shocked and confused stares, and the guard’s nervous gaze. He no doubt had spotted a few things. Firstly that I was Twilight Sparkle. Or was, rather, but he didn't need to know that. Secondly that I was in the company of a batpony and a couple other well-ragged ponies, clearly refugees. Thirdly, the well-battered and practically ancient .32 caliber revolver jammed in an equally ancient holster on my right hip.\n\nDeterminedly, I ignored the gazes and his wariness, and trotted up to the guard, using my magic to remove and levitate the pistol and belt away from my barrel- and careful not to knock loose my Kolibri hidden away within the rags. "I am here to seek asylum from the Illegitimate Solar Imperial Rule. Please, Sir, I need to see my brother and sister-in-law.""

I'll take you directly to the Empress at once. Please follow me."\n\nWith an inward sigh of relief, I nodded gently, and trotted along behind the guard. Step one was done; now it was time for step two."
 solarempiresparkles.4.d_susp:0 "He didn't seem to be buying it, by the squint of his eyes. I did my best not to let my nerves get the best of me, as my motley band of commandos did the same, behind me. It felt like an eternity as he judged me with his gaze, before giving a short nod. "Very well, follow me. I'll have to report this to my commanding officer, ma’am- you understand I'm sure- but otherwise I'll send you on your way."\n\nI exhaled a breath I didn't know I'd been holding. "Of course, sir. Can't be too careful, after all.""
 solarempiresparkles.4.a:0 "Let's carry on."

 solarempiresparkles.41.t:0 "Sister-in-law"
 solarempiresparkles.41.d:0 "The rather dull guardspony rushed us to the throne room, as I put on the best Twilight Sparkle impression that I could, and Scorecard’s group put on the best wayward Rebel impressions they could manage.\n\nUpon the guard’s introduction of us, Cadence immediately leapt down from her pedestal, and pulled me into an impressively firm hug. "Oh my goodness, Twilight! I'm so glad that you're safe! Were you followed? Did they hunt you? Are you okay?"\n\nI wheezed slightly, as Cadence attempted to murder me by hugging, which she took for being a tad sickly, as she pressed a hoof to my forehead. "Cadence, I’m okayyyy, promise. Just a bit ragged, is all. We got out okay. I have no idea if we were followed." That seemed to ease her concern at least, as she led us to our rooms, to get cleaned up and food in our bellies."
 solarempiresparkles.41.d_susp:0 "The meeting took far too long to arrange, for my liking. Far, far too long for an asylum request. I would have to instruct Scorecard and his lackeys to be doubly careful with his preparations. Finally, I was nallowed to enter the throne room, where my Sister-in-law was awaiting me. The tone was... cool, to say the least, but I could work with cool, if I had to.\n\nI gave Cadenza a respectful bow, from my position in front of her throne, as Scorecard and the twins did the same behind me. "Cadence, it's good to see you." I began, choosing my words carefully- she was already suspicious of me; being overly cold or overly honeyed with my words could blow my cover just as easily as being caught out as a spy. "I was starting to worry you wouldn't see me at all."\n\n"Yes, well... can't be too careful, after all. You'll have to pardon my concern, seeing as the guard who received you reported that you handed him a gun- I didn't even know you owned a gun, let alone had one. It's a relief to see you safe, though. Was your journey safe?"\n\n"It was... safe enough - as safe as something like that can get, in any case."\n\n"That is good to hear, at least. Come, Twilight, why don't I show you and your friends to your rooms?""
 solarempiresparkles.41.a:0 "We will see what Cadence thinks."

 solarempiresparkles.5.t:0 "Plan B"
 solarempiresparkles.5.d:0 ""I've got to know, Twilight, how bad is it over there?" Cadence questioned, over a warm cup of Jasmine tea, as we sat together in a parlor, a warm fireplace crackling happily nearby.\n\n"Bad." I replied, keeping my tone sad. A few lies here and there, hidden amongst the truth would be the way forward, I felt. "Purges, ponies being sent to camps. I haven't seen or heard from the girls in a week." That bit, at least, was true. Re-education would take a few months, after all. I paused, taking a sip of my tea. "Luna has been... deposed of, to put things mildly."\n\nTo put them more firmly: she was on the moon again. Permanently, this time.\n\nWhilst Cadence was stirring her own tea, trying to gather her thoughts, I chanced a gaze up to the wall clock- it'd been a couple hours. Hopefully, Scorecard hadn't run into any troubles."

Risky, but necessary, I swallowed the miniscule weapon, feeling somewhat sickly as I choked it down my throat. Then, I cast a long ago learnt medical spell to stave off the effects of the onset lead poisoning for a full forty-eight hours. Long enough for me to exhume the weapon- preferably by mouth- later. I then put on my sleepiest face, and stumbled over to the door, opening it.\n\nAs I suspected, I was slammed quickly to the ground and placed in hoofcuffs, a horn bracket clamped at my horn’s base to prevent magic.\n\n"Twilight Sparkle, you are under arrest for conspiracy of treason against the Crystal throne. If you resist, you shall be terminated with extreme prejudice."\n\n"Well sod you too, whatever your name is. Bloody wonderful thing to wake up to."\n\nA few hours of processing later, and I was in the dungeons, far below the castle itself. Ironic, in my opinion. Cadence and Shining had, of course, come down and given me the usual spiels, and I'd played the unrepentant zealot- which, to be fair, I probably am- and so I was left to my own devices. Waiting a few minutes to make sure I was fully alone, I moved to a dark corner of the room. I didn't have magic, but I still had a Kolibri, after all. It was all just about finding the proper time to break out, now."

 solarempiresparkles.15.d_susp:0 "There was a slight knock on the door, as Scorecard let himself in, closing and locking it behind him. He looked frustrated, as I gazed questioningly at the batpony from over my reading glasses. "Well?"\n\n"I was caught." He whispered softly, holding up a hoof to placate me. "I explained it away at being lost, but they're no doubt more suspicious. Nonetheless I did manage to get what I was looking for, so we have that going for us."\n\nI'd have said I expected better, but truthfully, I'd expected worse out of the barely a pony. "Very well. We’ll go forward, cautiously. Give me a few hours to prepare; I'll find you." With a soundless nod, he turned about and left, locking the door back behind him. Just in case."
 solarempiresparkles.15.d:0 "I looked up from the book I’d been reading, as somepony knocked gently on the door. "It's open." I greeted neutrally, unsure of who was at the door. As the familiar face of Scorecard entered the room, shutting it behind him with a smile, I shut the book, and gave the stallion my full attention. "Well?"\n\n"Everything is ready. Should be smooth sailing from here on out, Sparkle." He stated softly as he walked over, careful not to give anything that he did not have to away, in case we were being spied upon.\n\n"Good to hear. I'll come find you when I'm ready, then. Good evening, Scorecard."\n\n"And you as well, Sparkle." And with a nod, he was gone, as I settled back into my reading. I'd give it a few hours, then go forward with the operation. Tonight was to be a night of swiftness and precision, and I needed time to prepare myself, mentally. Soon."

 solarempiresparkles.16.a:0 "Now, we just need to grab that brat..."

 solarempiresparkles.150.t:0 "Almost there"
 solarempiresparkles.150.d:0 "Scorecard placed a hoof against the wall of the hallway we were in. Tapping soundlessly against it to a rhythm he only knew- the rhythm of a guard’s hoofsteps. A long, tense, second, then he gave me a fanged grin and nodded. I couldn't help but smirk back. Pathetic excuse for a pony he may have been, but he was damn good at his work. I'd have to request Daybreaker for further use of his services, once this was all over.\n\nThe four of us slunk into the next hall, and halted outside a particular room I'd known quite well. Princess Flurry Heart’s bedroom. Hopefully, the filly would be sleeping quietly, and not raise quite a ruckus. I softly pushed the door open, and, as my eyes adjusted to the darkness, my breath died in my throat.\n\nFlash Sentry, a massive handcannon of some sort in on his hip, exhaled gently, moving his hoof away from the holster. "Jeez, Pr-Twilight. Scared me half to death."\n\nThis moronic idiot was guarding my Niece? Now I was doubly glad I was stealing her away. "Ah, apologies...Corporal?"\n\n"Er. Major, actually. Got a battlefield commision!"\n\n"Major? You are moving up in the world, Flash." I started to doubt the sanity of my brother - putting Flash Sentry in any position of responsibility?\n\n"Mind if I step in for a minute? I wanted to see Flurry Heart again..."\n\n"Oh, of course, your hi- ma’am. No reason you can't. You are her aunt after all. Just keep it down, she is sleeping."\n\nI flicked my gaze momentarily back to Scorecard, who nodded and fell back from the door, to explain to the twins, as I myself stepped inside, closing the door gently behind me. Almost mechanically, I lit a small light spell with my horn, cantering gently over. "It's been so long since I've seen her, it feels.""
 solarempiresparkles.150.a:0 "Flash Sentry seems to be intensly thinking about something..."

 solarempiresparkles.17.t:0 "Complications"
 solarempiresparkles.17.d:0 ""I mean, you were here just a few weeks ago, remember?" Flash then paused, as if he'd started to say something, then thought of something else.\n\nMy heart fell to the pit of my stomach in dread, as I heard the tell-tale sound of Flash’s handcannon’s hammer being cocked. "Twilight Sparkle’s magic is magenta." He stated simply.\n\nI clicked my tongue, and turned about, slowly, so as not to provoke the stallion, maintaining my magical aura to avoid his suspicion. I didn't want to resort to my Kolibri- yet.\n\nInstead I used my magic to wrest the gun from his grip, as it discharged harmlessly into the ceiling. Flash closed the distance, slamming me into the ground, as the door to the room itself burst open. Jabbing a wing at my chest to expunge the breath from my lungs, his other tugged at a shrill- whistle, quickly brought to his mouth, as it sung out an alarm. A quick whip from Scorecard’s Welrod, directly to Flash’s head, knocked the stallion out, but the damage had already been done."
 solarempiresparkles.17.a:0 "Leg it!"

 solarempiresparkles.18.t_fail:0 "Caught"
 solarempiresparkles.18.d_fail:0 "I spun about, gazing at the door in shock, as pistol fire barked, splattering Scorecard’s blood all over Axle Grease. The twins spun about, their own weapons- knives- at the ready, and were similarly cut down by what could only be the Crystal Guard. I quickly tossed my Kolibri out the open window above Flurry’s bed, before letting my magic fall silent, holding my hooves up in surrender as Crystal Guards filled the room.\n\n"Twilight Sparkle of the Solar Empire, you are under arrest for plotting and attempted treason against the Crystal Crown, Espionage between two sovereign nations, and assuming Major Sentry does not survive, Murder. Do not resist."\n\nLike I had much of a choice."
 solarempiresparkles.18.b:0 "I was so close..."
 solarempiresparkles.18.t:0 "Slip away"
 solarempiresparkles.18.d:0 "Thinking quickly, I stood to my hooves, and motioned for the other three to come close. Wasting no time, I let out a flash teleport, as the room burst open, my breath momentarily catching in my throat as I came face to face with a very angry Shining Armor.\n\nWe found ourselves out in the snow, as I allowed my fury to swell, lending heat to myself and the others. I wished for nothing more than to bring the holy ruination of my Empress’ ruination down upon the Crystal Ponies. However, I had to remain calm and collected. The Crystal Guard would no doubt be looking for us, as Cadence’s insistence, so time was of the essence. Quickly, I formed a spell Matrix, centered on Canterlot, and lit up my horn. At least we would escape to tell the tale."
 solarempiresparkles.18.a:0 "At least I got out - but knowing Daybreaker, it might have been better to stay here."

 solarempiresparkles.19.t:0 "Success"
 solarempiresparkles.19.d:0 ""I mean, you were here just a few weeks ago, remember?" Flash then paused, as if he'd started to say something, then thought of something else.\n\n"Twilight, why is your magical aura yellow?"\n\nMy heart skipped a beat, and my brain froze, as I turned to face the stallion, who was more confused than concerned. I no doubt had a troubled smile on my face.\n\n"Oh, well, you see-" a quick flick of my horn, and the minuscule Kolibri- smallest developed pistol in the world, apparently, chirped four times, it's normally incredibly inaccurate 2.7mm rounds traveling the short journey from the barrel to Sentry’s barrel, as he flopped back, down and out for the count. Scorecard and the twins burst in immediately, carrying their own holdout weapons, consisting of a stiletto, another Kolibri, and a Solar Imperial made Welrod. I chanced a look over to Flurry; still sleeping soundly, and levitated her over in my magic, dropping the Kolibri- it's job was over. After awaiting a tense moment to make sure I wasn't interrupted, the four of us bunched up, my magic bringing Flurry close to my barrel, and I began to cast my oft-used spell.\n\nA few matrices and we were safely home across the border, Hollow Shades’ quiet farmhouses greeting us. My niece snored gently, bringing a wide smile to my face. "Gentlecolts: well bloody done.""
