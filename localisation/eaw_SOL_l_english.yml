 equestria.139.t:0 "Issue of conscription"
 equestria.139.d:0 "Since Equestria has not been touched by war in centuries, drafting ponies into military was never necessary. However, with growing threat on horizon, some politicians have proposed to institute a draft to better prepare our country for the coming storm."
 equestria.139.a:0 "Nonsense, peace will prevail."
 equestria.139.b:0 "A limited draft shall suffice."
 equestria.139.c:0 "We have to be prepared for anything - institute extensive conscription."

 equestria.140.t:0 "Economic focus"
 equestria.140.d:0 "Equestrian economy has great potential, however right now it is focused on providing goods and services for the ponies - as it has for decades. That being said, it might be prudent to start focusing on defence and heavy industries - to safeguard our nation in a changing world."
 equestria.140.a:0 "There is no reason to interfere in the market."
 equestria.140.b:0 "We shall prepare for economic mobilization."
 equestria.140.b.tp:0 "Can now change §YEconomic Laws§W"

 equestria.141.t:0 "Conscription crisis"
 equestria.141.d:0 "Groups of conscientious objectors and pacifists have been trying to dodge the draft since the beginning of the war, but today, the situation has reached the breaking point. Large amounts of ponies are determined to avoid being sent to the front. If this situation is left alone, it may lead to serious ponypower shortages."
 equestria.141.a:0 "It is their right to protest."
 equestria.141.b:0 "Everypony needs to fight."
 equestria.141.c:0 "Crack down on them so hard they won't think of dodging draft again!"

 equestria.142.t:0 "Anti-war publications"
 equestria.142.d_defense:0 "With our army on the defensive, some of the leading national publications have started to print defeatist messages, undermining the will of our ponies to fight. Freedom of press is one of the tenents of Equestrian society - but perhaps it is time for extraordinary measures?"
 equestria.142.d_off:0 "With our army bravely fighting the enemy, some of the leading national publications have started to print pacifist messages, urging to end the war immediately. This, of course, doesn't help the war effort. Freedom of press is one of the tenents of Equestrian society - but perhaps it is time for extraordinary measures?"
 equestria.142.a:0 "The media cannot be shackled."
 equestria.142.b:0 "Institute emergency war-time censorship."

 equestria.143.t:0 "Princess Celestia's Speech"
 equestria.143.d:0 "In this grave hour, perhaps the most fateful in our history, I send to every household of my ponies, both at home and overseas, this message, spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold and speak to you myself. For the first time in centuries, we are at war. Over and over again, we have tried to find a peaceful way out of the differences between ourselves and those who are now our enemies; but it has been in vain."
 equestria.143.a:0 "We have been forced into a conflict we have not wanted."
 equestria.143.b:0 "I, as the Princess of Equestria, will do everything in my power to protect my little ponies."
 equestria.143.c:0 "[CHN.GetLeader] will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen!"

 equestria.144.t:0 "The times are changing"
 equestria.144.d:0 "Since times immemorable, ponies have been a peaceful race, with the Magic of Friendship able to solve all problems that might have befallen then. Unfortunately, it seems that this world is coming to an end. Can Magic of Friendship still survive when Equestria is under attack?"
 equestria.144.a:0 "After this war, we will go back to our peaceful ways."
 equestria.144.b:0 "The times have changed, and we must adapt."
 equestria.144.c:0 "I need to do everything to keep my ponies safe - whether they like it, or not."

 equestria.147.t:0 "Wartime Press Act"
 equestria.147.d:0 "Freedom of press is a founding block of Equestrian society - but, as some nobles and politicians have suggested, in desperate times like these, it might be wise to impose limitations on speech that will help the war effort."
 equestria.147.a:0 "We cannot deny our citizens a basic freedom, even in war."
 equestria.147.b:0 "Slight censorship will get the job done."
 equestria.147.c:0 "No more - they will write what I tell them to write."

 equestria.148.t:0 "Martial law"
 equestria.148.d:0 "We are in a state of war. Peacetime laws, while preserving the liberties of ponies, are becoming a hindrance in these desperate times. Will due process be another victim of the war?"
 equestria.148.a:0 "[Root.GetName] is a harmonic society, war or not."
 equestria.148.b:0 "Martial law has to be instituted."
 equestria.148.c:0 "In order to defend [Root.GetName], laws have to be changed."

 equestria.151.t:0 "Wartime administration"
 equestria.151.d:0 "As war drags on, the civilian administration has shown to be completely unadjusted to the harsh realities of warfare. We may militarize the administration and local governments to help the war effort and calm the home front."
 equestria.151.a:0 "Reforms of civilian administration will suffice."
 equestria.151.b:0 "Military will join civilians for the time of war."
 equestria.151.c:0 "They have shown to be incompetent and unable to protect Equestria."

 equestria.152.t:0 "War Plan"
 equestria.152.d:0 "A comprehensive plan has been prepared in order to fully mobilize the entire society in defense of [Root.GetName]. That being said, the War Plan, as it began to be called, may lead to considerable hardships for our ponies."
 equestria.152.a:0 "The plan doesn't need to be as demanding."
 equestria.152.b:0 "Unfortunate, but necessary. Implement the War Plan."
 equestria.152.c:0 "Young, old, colt, mare - all shall fight - either on the front, or at home."

 equestria.153.t:0 "Concers about Celestia"
 equestria.153.d_luna:0 "Sister, you have become... colder. I am worried about you. You are not who you used to be - your gentle smile and optimism, gone. I know how hard it is to rule, especially now, but some of the measures you have enacted hurt our ponies, not protect them. Please, sister, stop for a while and think about this."
 equestria.153.d_nobles:0 "Your Majesty, we couldn't help but notice that you, please pardon the term, seem different that before. The policies you have enacted, while of course necessary, have been considered extreme by some. Perhaps Your Majesty could reconsider some of the details?"
 equestria.153.b:0 "I am perfectly fine. Do not bother me again."
 equestria.153.a:0 "Perhaps you are right - it seems I had lost myself..."

 equestria.154.t:0 "Supernova"
 equestria.154.d_war:0 "The enemy is on the horizon, relentlessly pushing towards complete and utter destruction of Harmony and Equestria. I had been too complacent, too weak to protect my ponies. But now, I see the error of my ways. I will stop at nothing until the enemies of Harmony are ashes and dust. I shall become what I was always destined to be!"
 equestria.154.d_nowar:0 "Surrounded by enemies, both internal and external, the Harmony is in danger. My ponies need to be protected from them, even if they don't yet see the danger. I had been too complacent, too weak - but now, I see the error of my ways. I will stop at nothing until the enemies of Harmony are ashes and dust. I shall become what I was always destined to be!"
 equestria.154.a:0 "Harmony through Order. Peace throught Strength."
 equestria.154.a.tp:0 "Become §YDaybreaker§W\n"
 equestria.154.b:0 "Wait, what am I doing? Those aren't my thoughts, I am not like this!"
 equestria.154.c:0 "They will know the power of the Sun!"

 equestria.157.t:0 "Supernova"
 equestria.157.d:0 "No. This §Yis§W me now. This is what I have become. I am the ruler of Equestria, I am the Sun incarnate, I am a god amongst weak and unfit to rule! I am Daybreaker!"
 equestria.157.a:0 "§YSol Invicta!§W"

 news.sol.1.d:0 "Today marks a marked turn of events in Equestrian History. On this day, Princess Celestia of the Equestrian Diarchy disbanded the government’s bureaucratic institutions, with speed and efficiency. She was then swiftly arranged to be crowned Empress of the new Solar Empire, as Equestria is being renamed as. Reportedly, in response to that, her Sister, Princess Luna, burst into the Coronation with several other officials in rebellion, and attempted to halt the coronation. Time can only tell what shall come of this, as powerful magical blasts fill the Canterlot skyline."

Meanwhile, the new Empress has refocused her efforts on, quote, "Winning the war, at any cost, and keeping my ponies safe from outside harm, from anyone - Pony, Changeling, Griffon, or any other being seeking to destroy Harmony.""

 solarempire.6.d:0 "With Princess Celestia having undergone a transformation into Daybreaker, Princess Luna has taken up arms to defend what she claims Harmony. Daybreaker, however, insists that she is still the rightful ruler of Equestria, and that Luna is misguided. The question is: which side do we take?"
 solarempire.6.a:0 "Princess Luna is right!"
 solarempire.6.b:0 "This is not our war to fight!"
 solarempire.6.c:0 "Daybreaker is the ruler of Equestria!"

 solarempire.7.t:0 "Bend the knee?"

 solarempire.10.d_inq:0 "After the investigation has revealed unthought levels of treachery, disloyality and degeneracy in the Imperial Army, the Empress, forever shall she reign, has decided in righteous fury to allow the Holy Flame of the Inquisition to cleanse the Imperial Military of traitors, heretics and unbelivers."

 solarempire.13.a:0 "Sunrise Sparkle has a nice ring to it."

 solarempire.14.t:0 "Taking Sides"
 solarempire.14.d:0 "With Princess Celestia having undergone a transformation into Daybreaker, and with Nightmare Moon having her sight set on Canterlot, we find ourselves in a precarious position. Do we support Daybreaker and the Solar Empire - the continuation of the Equestrian goverment, or hope that Nightmare Moon will be more lenient? Or perhaps, given the players, maybe the best move is not to play?"
 solarempire.14.a:0 "We are staying out of this."
 solarempire.14.b:0 "We have our obligations towards Equestria."
 solarempire.14.c:0 "Nightmare Moon doesn't sound so terrible now..."

 solarempire.15.t:0 "Time for Independence"
 solarempire.15.d:0 "The war is over, and the common enemy uniting us and Daybreaker is gone. Shall we keep the status quo and our subservience to the Solar Empire, or should we break ties with the tyrant in [SOL.Capital.GetName]?"
