 solarempire.14.t:0 "Taking Sides"
 solarempire.14.d:0 "With Princess Celestia having undergone a transformation into Daybreaker, and with Nightmare Moon having her sight set on Canterlot, we find ourselves in a precarious position. Do we support Daybreaker and the Solar Empire - the continuation of the Equestrian goverment, or hope that Nightmare Moon will be more lenient? Or perhaps, given the players, maybe the best move is not to play?"
