convene_the_council:0 "Convene the House Council"
convene_the_council_desc:0 "It is a time of crisis. In the lands of the ailing Empire, unruly vassals connive secession, whilst the Emperor's health grows worse by the day. To the east, Aquileia teeters on the brink of another civil war. To the south, the expansionist Wingbardy and her allies hungrily eye their neighbours. House Avian is surrounded by enemies, and a new strategy is needed if the House is to survive the turbulent years to come."
go_with_count_ehrenreich:0 "Go with Count Ehrenreich"
go_with_count_ehrenreich_desc:0 "Count Ehrenreich and his policy of armed neutrality is the way forward. Only through isolation will House Avian be safe from the madness outside its borders."
go_with_viceroy_joachim:0 "Go with Viceroy Joachim"
go_with_viceroy_joachim_desc:0 "Viceroy Joachim and his ideal of a union between the Three Great Houses of the Griffonian Heartlands is the path to Avian greatness, and protection from the great powers that would seek to engulf us."
proclamation_of_neutrality:0 "Proclamation of Avian Neutrality"
proclamation_of_neutrality_desc:0 "Whilst House Avian has remained neutral and aloof from any conflicts since its secession from the Empire, its neutrality has never been officially acknowledged. Declaring our intention to remain neutral in future conflicts will hopefully insulate us from the worst of the wars to come."
intergigantes:0 "Avian Intergigantes"
intergigantes_desc:0 "House Avian sits at the epicentre between three belligerent nations - the Empire, Aquileia, and Wingbardy. Trapped between the giants, House Avian must unite with its fellow Houses or perish."
pursue_true_neutrality:0 "Pursue True Neutrality"
pursue_true_neutrality_desc:0 "The feuding houses of Eyrie and Erie will never be able to put aside their differences, even to face a common foe. Like it or not, House Avian will have to go it alone; there is no point in bedding a corpse, even if there are two of them."
overtures_erie:0 "Overtures to House Erie"
overtures_erie_desc:0 "We lack a permanent representative within the court of House Erie, and any communication between House Avian and one of our officials is terribly slow. By establishing an embassy we will solve both problems in a single stroke."
overtures_eyrie:0 "Overtures to House Eyrie"
overtures_eyrie_desc:0 "Communication with House Eyrie, despite being neighbours, is problematic even at the best of times. Installing a diplomat from our house will ease these issues and open up new diplomatic options with House Eyrie."
pursue_economic_cooperation:0 "Pursue Economic Cooperation"
pursue_economic_cooperation_desc:0 "Alone, our economic might is paltry compared to those of larger nations. Only by forming new trade and economic deals between our houses will we stand to make an impression in the global stage."
promote_interhouses_fraternisation:0 "Promote Inter-House Fraternisation"
promote_interhouses_fraternisation_desc:0 "The once Great Houses of the Griffon Heartlands have long since fallen apart into tribalist factionalism that has only served to drive a wedge between our people. We are all griffons, and we are all griffons of the realms of the Three Houses."
student_exchange_program:0 "Student Exchange Program"
student_exchange_program_desc:0 "Looking closely at the different schools between the three houses, one is hard-pressed to find significant differences in the way that we teach and what our cubs learn. A way to nip the inter-house disdain would be to show our students just how similar we all are."
three_houses_corporation:0 "Three Houses Corporation"
three_houses_corporation_desc:0 "Previously one of the better examples of our houses’ capacity to cooperate, the Three Houses Corporation can expand its scope into research and development if we encourage further investments from all three houses."
relax_citizenship_requirements:0 "Relax Citizenship Requirements"
relax_citizenship_requirements_desc:0 "Ancient Heartlands families have been forced apart due to the stringent citizenship requirements and travel permits between the houses’ territories. Loosening some of these restrictions is not only morally the right thing, but a pragmatic move on having our people warm up to the idea of a single realm of the Three Houses."
scientific_exchange_program:0 "Scientific Exchange Program"
scientific_exchange_program_desc:0 "Each of the Three Houses have had their own research programmes that diverged and would often be contrary to the betterment of the Heartlands themselves.

common_markets_agreement:0 "Common Market Agreement"

three_colleges:0 "Support the Tripartite College"
three_colleges_desc:0 "With coalescing curriculums, there’s no reason why we cannot form a single curriculum offered by a single college.

ending_the_rivalry:0 "Ending the Rivalry"
ending_the_rivalry_desc:0 "The feud between House Eire and House Eyrie have continually been a hindrance to a unified House Realm, and any hope to achieve that dream starts with an end to the rivalry. Let us begin the arduous process, for a better future for our people."
annual_hunting_trip:0 "The Annual Hunting Trip"
annual_hunting_trip_desc:0 "The time is upon us: the yearly hunting trip where most of the House Avian nobles shall leave for the countryside.

Hunting never got anyone killed, anyways."
weekly_luncheons:0 "Weekly Luncheons"
weekly_luncheons_desc:0 "The best way for rivals to get over their feud is to force them to see and treat each other as equals.

winterfest_ball:0 "The Winterfest Ball"
winterfest_ball_desc:0 "The Winterfest Ball is a House Erie tradition, and has never seen a single member of House Eyrie attend since the start of their bloody rivalry.

scion_swap:0 "The Scion Swap"
scion_swap_desc:0 "Tensions have diminished between House Erie and House Eyrie, but there are many that are sceptical of a lasting peace.

Montague Eyrie, Earl of Verenia, and Lady Rosaline Erie of Bantry have demonstrated an interest in this exchange."
treaty_of_friendship:0 "Eyrie-Erie Treaty of Friendship"
treaty_of_friendship_desc:0 "Bread was broken and shared, love has bloomed, and plenty of laughs were had between House Erie and House Eyrie. Were one to see these two houses interact without knowing their history, they would find it difficult to believe that they were ever at each other’s throats.

annual_military_exercises:0 "Annual Military Exercises"
annual_military_exercises_desc:0 "We should work with the other Houses to pursue full military cohesion through annual military exercises.

unified_railroad_network:0 "A Unified Railroad Network"

technological_cooperation:0 "Interhouses Technological Cooperation"

full_integration_desc:0 "It's time House Avian pursues full integration with both House Eyrie and House Erie in order to unite our houses under one banner and to strengthen our unity and prosperity while deterring aggressors from both the Empire, Wingbardy, and Aquelia.

tripartite_legion:0 "Form the Tripartite Legion"
tripartite_legion_desc:0 "After years of division, feuding, hostility, and animosity between House Eyrie and House Erie, we as House Avian have been able put it all aside to work together. Not just work together, but we also have become brothers with the other houses during this turbulent period. Now we will lead both houses into a new future of security and order in which we can further our gains and help our houses prosper further." 
leaders_field_marshalls:0 "A Common Military Leadership"
leaders_field_marshalls_desc:0 "It's time we unite our military leadership with the other houses and form a new chain of command under House Avian.

the_second_winterfest_ball:0 "The Second Winterfest Ball"
the_second_winterfest_ball_desc:0 "After the success of the first Winterfest Ball, we should make an even bigger one in which all houses are already included, with more food, drink, music, as well as more grand speechs to showcase the common ground that every house has with each other. It's time we make our unity a true tradition to stand the test of time."
overtures_flowena:0 "Overtures to Flowena"

overtures_pomovarra_desc:0 "The Pomovorra Garrison has long been at odds with its neighbors, and reasonably so with its past animosity towards flowena, reasonable distrust from the aggressive Aquileans, and their past issues with our House.

### EVENTS #################################
###########################################
avian.2.t:0 "Forming the Tripartite"
avian.2.d:0 "House Avian has sent us an interesting message regarding mutual defense; uniting together into a more united power bloc to defend against outside aggression. This 'Tripartite', as they call it, would place us in a threeway bilateral military pact, both for offensive, and defensive measures."
avian.1.t:0 "Joining the Intergigantes"
avian.1.d:0 "Here, today, we proclaim the Intergigantes Tripartite, While we have yet to send a formal invitation to Erie and Eyrie, the creation alone should be enough to turn beaks towards us. They know we are becoming a regional power. "
avian.3.t:0 "An Ally joins the Tripartite"
avian.3.d:0 "[from.Getname] has officially joined the Tripartite! With their acceptance, we all grow stronger together!"
avian.4.t:0 "Our Offer Refused"
avian.4.d:0 "[from.Getname] has decided to refuse the invitation to the Tripartite, and they have deigned to not share their reason with us"
avian.5.t:0 "House Avian requests Our Vassalisation"
avian.5.d:0 "House Avian, citing the stability brought about by them, has sent us an official request, which would see us become vassals under them. Do we accept?"
avian.6.t:0 "A Faithful Partner Gained"
avian.6.d:0 "[from.Getname] has agreed to become our vassal!"
avian.7.t:0 "Our Offer Refused"
avian.7.d:0"[from.Getname] has refused to become our vassal, despite everything we've done for them!
avian.8.t:0 "The Declaration of Avian Neutrality"
avian.8.d:"House Avian, here and today officially declares that they will be taking no side in the conflicts that are to come. "We would rather see to the peace and wellbeing of our own people, rather then seeing to the deaths of others"
avian.9.t:0 "Introducing the Linguistic Divide"
avian.9.d:0"Here in House Avian, we are a people of many cultures, being between the Empire, Aquelia, and Wingbardy, the three major players that surround us. As a result, our nation as a whole speaks a variety of languages; and predictably, not everyone understands everyone else. While we have standardized the language used for the aristocracy, this measure is as of right now, limited only to the aristocracy"
avian.10.t:0 "The Second Winterfest Ball"
avian.10.d:0" The unification process has been going smoothly, so smoothly, in fact, that a ball at Hallhaus has been planned. Both lords and ladies from all parts of Avian, Erie, and Eyrie met together peacefully this day, under an unified banner and a promise of peace to last between the Houses' peoples. Wine flowed, words streamed like rivers, and much merrymaking was had; such is the nature of an event. Quite a few interhouse relationships were even formed. Alas, for not all was peaceful; unknown assailants fired shots into the party; many were wounded and the perpetrator escaped. The ball was swiftly put to an end as the guests were evacuated from the scene and survivors rushed to the hospitals"
avian.11.t:0 "Battle for the Radio Transmitter"
avian.11.t:0 "The civil war's fires rage bright as it's latest battleground is decided; Hallhaus's radio station. While no faction has direct control of it as yet, it has been deemed by all sides an incredibly important asset; whoever holds it has the power to spread their message across all three Houses; the Loyalists, Communists, and Militarists all are shedding blood for it. But who won that night?"
avian.12.t:0 "Battle for the Railway Station"
avian.13.t:0 "Battle for the Hallhaus Armoury"
avian.13.d:0"The armoury, a critical strategic point, being the main store of weaponry in House Avian, has come under assault by both loyalist and communist forces. While it is currently in the iron grip of the military, it remains to be seen whether the weapons to win the war will remain in their hands, or fall into the claws of their foes"
avian.14.t:0 "Battle for the Des Voeux Hotel"
avian.14.t:0"The Loyalist's main stronghold; the Des Vouex hotel, and the temporary residence of the vast majority of the nobles who attended the Winterfest ball has come under siege and now both communists and Trubach's putchschists are seeking to make the hotel's halls run red with noble blood"
avian.15.t:0 "The Lieutenant-General's Victory" #Haus von Zypressen/Zypressen-Dynastie#
avian.15.t:0 "A victor has been named; the military coup lead by Lieutenant-General Trubach has won the day. All communist ringleaders and Loyalist generals have been tried and found guilty of treason, and the country is going through a major overhaul as martial law is implemented throughout the Houses"
avian.16.t:0 "House Avian stands strong" 
avian.16.d:0"A victor has been named; the Loyalists stand strong. The nobles are safe, and order has been restored. The communist ringleaders and Trubach, alongside his high command, have been tried and found guilty of high treason and murder. The country is now consolidating itself for the future ahead"
avian.17.t:0 "The Red Flag over Hallhaus" 
avian.17.d:0"A victor has been named; the Communists have taken hold of Hallhaus, and with it, largely uncontested control over the three Houses, as almost all the nobility were present, and they have now been, alongside Trubach and his high command, executed. The red flag flies over Hallhaus, and the country is rebuilding itself from the ground up"
avian.18.t:0 "The Midnight After" 
avian.18.t:0 "Hallhaus has been the site of a bitter civil war, one that will decide the fate of the Three houses. While currently, no side is a clear winner, once the ashes and dust settle, the fate of the three Houses shall be determined..."
avian.19.t:0 "The Results of the Election"
avian.19.d:0"With the Loyalist victory, they have come to realise one thing; their society must be made free and fair. As such, even though tradition survived, restructuring is nessecary; the three Houses look forwards to a bright future as a true democracy. The nobility will remain largely unchanged, aside from their power being reduced, and the first elections have seen a landslide victory by the Federalist party".
avian.20.t:0 "The Proclamation of the Kingdom of Verenia"
avian.20.d:0"With Trubach's victory, the three Houses have been tied together in a military dictatorship; The largest city of the region, Verenia, and his  home city, is where the new government rules from; and as such, House Avian, Erie, and Eyrie no longer exists. Long live Trubach, Long live the Kingdom of Verenia!"
