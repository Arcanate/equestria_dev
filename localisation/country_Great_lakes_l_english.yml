great_lakes.1.d:0 "Production of gold in the Buckure mines had been steadily reducing year by year, but at least the miners kept finding new deposits underground. This year, however, there's been no such luck. Any new veins of native gold discovered are not economically worthwhile to mine, as the content of gold in the ore is so low. The rivers flowing down from the hills, too, have smaller amount of gold dust in their waters. It seems like the gold mines of Buckure, renowned throughout the world, have finally been thoroughly emptied.\n\nWhile mining operations in Buckure will continue, we can no longer expect large quantities of gold to come from there. At best, there might be an occasional golden nugget, but nothing more."
