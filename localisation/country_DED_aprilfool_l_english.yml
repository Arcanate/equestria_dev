The world beyond the League is more advanced, their armors are likely to be stronger, thicker, and more of a problem. But for now, with these spells, we should have enough power to make the armors of the Order's knights useless."

DED_APN_their_will:0 "Their Will"

DED_APN_never_ends_desc:0 "Necromancy is the key to the end of Death. And it is one marvelous form of magic. With more specialised necromantic spells, we are able to reanimate our undeads with better memory functions. This allows them to learn from their mistakes from beyond the grave."

DED_APN_fear_not_death:0 "As They Do Not Know Hunger"
DED_APN_fear_not_death_desc:0 "Hunger. We kills the living to feed on their corpses, perpetuating the cycle of life and death. But the undead know no such things.

DED_APN_which_can_eternal_lie_desc:0 "What is a soul ? Some will tell you that it is what you are. But what are you without a body ? Dead. Then, are you a body ? No. A body without a Soul is but a husk. But this raises one last interesting question: Can a soul survives in a body that already possess a soul ?"

DED_APN_greater_mind:0 "Greater Mind"

DED_APN_the_living_flesh:0 "The Living Flesh"
DED_APN_the_living_flesh_desc:0 "One of the thing our infiltrators have discovered in the more advanced realms of mortals was the machines and factories they use to produce various items en masse. Our previous experiments with the fusing of bodies has given us an idea: Automatons of flesh. Similar to the mindless meat puppets we've used to produce our weapons before, but with bodies attuned to the task."

DED_APN_living_factories_desc:0 "After months of preparation, we have finally done it. A creature of flesh and bones beyond anything in this world. A most complex lifeform, fuelled by necromantic magic and capable of creating the advanced items our society need. Our only limitation on this world is the very ressources of the earth.

DED_APN_monsters_in_the_sea_desc:0 "Boats of Steels. One of the creation of these mortals. Trully fascinating machines. And, we'll have to copy them in order to ensure our naval supremacy. It would be a shame if we were contained to this continent, wouldn't it ?"

DED_APN_soldiers_in_out_and_over:0 "Soldiers, In, Out and Over"
DED_APN_soldiers_in_out_and_over_desc:0 "Instead of using poor quality bodies as part of our armies, we can use their bones in which our other soldiers shall be clad and fused with. With this, our soldiers will be more resilient to our enemy's more modern weaponery."
DED_APN_soldiers_in_out_and_over_tooltip:0 "We will now only be able to convert 70% of the living in conquered states (down from 90%)\nOur infantry will be fused and clad in bones. Gaining armor and hardness."

DED_APN_two_becomes_one:0 "Three Becomes One"

DED_APN_skeletal_ascension:0 "Skeletal Ascendance"

DED_APN_monsters_of_bones_desc:0 "'No place better for a body than 6 feet underground' is a motto now often used by our tunnel and trench diggers. I knew it would be fun to let them keep some sense of humor. Especially when that sense of humor translates into 'digging graves' for our enemies."

DED_APN_machines_of_flesh:0 "Machines of Bones"
DED_APN_machines_of_flesh_desc:0 "Applying the spells we've used to create armies of skeletons, specialised workers, and the light forms of telepathy, we've done it. We've created true warmachines made of flesh and bones. These shall put to shame the armored machines of the mortals."

These strange tomes had become sort of an obsession to her as of late. But... not only to her. This section was filled with this new kinds of 'thought-provoking' literature, and these had become common subjects of discussion amongst the lichs and vampires of the league. And they had begun to spread doubts: \n'Is Apocalypse the true destiny of the League?'\n\nRosa too had become victim of such doubts.

He had been convinced, until five minutes ago, that every horror in this world was intimately familiar to him.\n\nAnd he had spent the last five minutes puking his guts out.\n\nThe ghoul fusion was a... success? They were-- he swallowed hard-- fused, after all. Only one of their souls was still in a body, and all the parts were moving, after all. The technicians were gawking at the readings, remarking on the amazing speed and efficiency with which the nervous systems had interfaced. The biology had not quite been solved yet, though-- the thing was being sustained by necromancy temporarily as his servants began to calculate energy requirements, optimal limb geometry, etc. If this new age of necrotech engineering had taught Tibius anything, it was that flashy proof-of-concept experiments like this one, while impressive, were only the first step to full technical utilization.\n\nHe sighed, and sent a runner spirit to the central Hold with the news of the successful fusion. Lady Rosa’s pleasure would go far to soothe his worries, he knew, but something still nagged at him, the true cause of his nausea. As he stared at the shambling mass of ghoul flesh, it hit him. The raw gap between the glory and promise of the achievement and the ugliness of its physical form tore at him. He knew all of the arguments for the Unity program; after all, he was one of its chief supporters. Even after this, he still supported it wholeheartedly.\n\nBut, still. It disturbed him so much that he said it out loud."

dedaprilfool.171.t:0 "To Pierce the Very Pinnacle of Being"
dedaprilfool.171.d:0 "Rosa Maledicta stood still, breathing slowly, as the last two Unbound Necromancers of the League attached the living tubing to the outside of her body. They had offered her a topical anesthetic, which she had refused-- bodily pain would be very helpful, perhaps even necessary, for what was to come.\n\nThe tubes snaked through a great door, into the very heart of the Magehold. Protected by the strongest spells they could devise, the room was the temporary home of the Central Control Sphere, the beating heart of the One Being, the Great One that would bring all life together and destroy Death for all eternity. Rosa shivered with excitement, even as the tubes bit deep into her flesh, their teeth sprouting vasculae that meshed seamlessly with her body systems. She began to convulse for a few seconds before her autonomic nervous system was suppressed; almost without realizing it, Rosa Maledicta took her last breaths as an independent being.\n\nOne-by-one, non-essential body systems began to shut down. She felt her emotions flatten as her blood was cleared of hormones, her pain centers were suppressed, and the systems of the Control Sphere interfaced ever more deeply with her brain tissues. She could not even panic as her senses shut down; desperate to retain some semblance of continuity, her brain finally shut down from sheer input shock. The last thing her old unicorn body felt was being dragged across the stone floor, slowly, towards that door...\n\nShe awoke... sort of. There was nothing to feel, but... she could see, and her hearing was somehow split now. The Sphere had external sensory organs but she also heard... voices. Voices of the League necromancers and senior thralls, performing final checks on the systems. Internal checks, she realized. Though her mouth had surely been repurposed by now, she smiled broadly. It had worked. The hum of internal activity ceased as the other presences, other souls, acknowledged her arrival-- not as Rosa Maledicta, no. That shell was gone. Only the soul within endured.\n\nAnd that soul spoke, with a voice that would shake all worlds forever."

dedaprilfool.172.d:0 "The lands of Arcturia were silent. No birds chirped, no small animals darted through the underbrush. The only movement for hundreds of miles in every direction was the slow swaying of grass in the gentle breeze.\n\nThe Network, situated 9 feet above the grass in every direction, did not sway. Its bundles of glass wire, specially glazed in the living factories of the One Being, could propagate signals in volumes and at speeds that made the mere copper wire of Equestria and the Reich look like the Pegasus Express of the old days. It was the temporary nervous system of the One Being, reaching out over the vast distances of its domain, linking the several redundant control nodes and staging areas to deliver second-by-second commands to every part of the vast organism, but even this wonder was only in use while subtler methods of linkage were devised.\n\nSuddenly, the signal flow stopped. The Throne spoke.\n\n“In the course of my great work, I have often reflected on the past. When I was separated into hundreds of thousands of vampires, mortals, ghouls, thralls, and all kinds of beings, I was nothing. I squabbled within myself, murdering and lying and cheating to secure paltry power. I clung to life or tradition or magical wisdom, desperate to hoard what I foolishly believed was mine. When I died, I died alone; when I lived, I lived a pathetically small and incomplete life.\n\nIn one, we are all. This is the indisputable path to eternity. In one, we are all. This is the key to all the great questions that puzzled the mortal philosophers, the fire that animates their ideologues. And yet, I am not all. I am limited, constrained by the demands of resources, the resistance of mortals, the structures of space, time, and magic. How can eternity be constrained?\n\nInternal contradictions invariably lead to collapse. Therefore, I must cease to be limited. I will stretch my embrace over all life. I will hold the sun and moon as marbles in my hand. Alicorn and Windigo alike will join my supreme essence. No creature, great or small, will be kept from my embrace.\n\nThey will resist. They will throw their little contraptions at me, assemble their networks of force to destroy me. Some, in their foolishness, will be killed before accepting me. None of it will matter.\n\nI am already the world..."
