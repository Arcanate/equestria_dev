dedaprilfool.1.t:0 "A Strange Dream"
dedaprilfool.1.d:0 "Rosa awoke on her desk today. Apparently she was reading some book found in a forgotten section of the library of Magehold. These strange tomes had become sort of an obsession to herl as of late. But ... not only to her. This section was filled with this new kinds of 'thought-provoking' literature, and these had become common subjects of discussion amongst the lichs and vampires of the league. And they had begun to spread doubts: \n'Is Apocalypse the true destiny of the League ?'\n\nRosa too had become victim of such doubts. For long they had been gnawing at her mind and today, she made a decision."

POLITICS_APNROSALICH_DESC:0 "This monster is a far cry from the unicorn of old. Rosa Maledicta has enacted a dark ritual and turned herself into a ferocious lich. With her phylactery well hidden, she is now pulsing with dark power. Her seeming invincibility makes her cocky and aggressive. If she was ruthless before, now she has redefined the meaning of the word. Rosa seems angrier than before, quick to take life and raise it again in her service. Any remark about her monstrous appearance is quickly rewarded with death and she strides with a wicked confidence. No longer does she need to harsh punishments and harsher threats to keep her fellow necromancers in line, now she simply does such things for the pleasure. She is Rosa Maledicta the Queen of Bones. She comes for your soul and there will be no negotiation."
