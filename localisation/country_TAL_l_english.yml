TAL_duchess_ginerva:0 "Duchess Ginevra"
TAL_coal_clause:0 "The Coal Clause"
TAL_coal_clause_desc:0 "The Transnational Mining Clause in Article II of the Charter of the Karthinian Pact allows for Pact members to have resource extraction operations in each other’s territories, as well as the ability to openly transport it without strict border regulation and trade agreements. A section of this Clause refers to the ability of Wingbardian mining corporations to continue their pre-secession operations in other Pact countries. Colloquially referred to as the “Coal Clause” in Talouse, it has allowed for the Wingbardian corporations to operate without restraint in the Talousian Highlands. These companies often engage in unethical practices in the pursuit of profit and efficiency. The lack of benefits to both the workers and the nation, combined with the awful conditions, has led to the Clause being, near universally, viewed with disdain, and most of Talouse’s parties agree that it must be abolished."
TAL_flt_influence:0 "FLT influence"
TAL_flt_influence_desc:0 "Shortly after the end of the Falcor War, the Fronte Laburista Talusiano was formed, led by Emmanuel Talnara, factory worker turned journalist. The party sought to protest the abhorrent conditions in Talousian industry and appealed to urban laborers and the coal miners in the Highlands. Today, the party consists of a coalition of the majority- syndicalist factory workers and the more unorthodox miner communes. The FLT is said to have its claws wrapped around the neck of the nation’s industry, with almost every factory worker in Talouse seemingly in their pocket. Though its grasp is gentle now, if it is upset, it may choose to tighten its grip, “choking” the industry and, alongside it, the economy."
TAL_declining_economy:0 "Declining economy"
TAL_declining_economy_desc:0 "During the Falcor War, Wingbardy took out several loans from Talouse, and many Talousians were hired by Wingbardian companies.  When the war ended, Wingbardy couldn’t pay back its debts, and the Wingbardian companies laid off thousands of workers. This drained the Talousian economy, and it has continued to decline ever since. Though there was some recovery in the late 990s, it was not enough, and the Great Strike of 1003 reversed any gains made. Today, Talouse’s economy continues to suffer, primarily from a combination of political deadlock, a reduction in regional trade, and the closure of several young corporations in the fallout of 1003."

TAL_duchess_ginerva_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 13th of May, 965 in Talononte\n\n§YBiography§!: Ginevra di Chiazbini was born the eldest child of Duke Giovanni III of Talouse. She grew up in the comfort of the Ducal Palace, and was mostly carefree, consuming the knowledge given to her by her mentors. At an early age, she demonstrated a level of unmatched decisiveness, as well as her infamous temper, which greatly contrasted her patient and naive father. Her pleasant life was turned upside down by the Falcor War, which raged from 985-989 ALB. As the war progressed, she saw her father’s health rapidly deteriorate, alongside the nation’s economy. After the war’s end, there was a glimmer of hope for Ginevra when she married her lifelong sweetheart, the handsome Victor di Altomondi. This time of good feelings was short-lived however, as in 992, her father died of a heart attack, and the young griffoness was crowned Duchess. Ever since then, she has been a staunch pacifist, denouncing war and its horrors. Even though she was a pacifist, her belligerent constitution remained, being further incensed by the post-war economic issues. During the strike of 1003, she famously stormed into Parliament, demanding that a resolution be passed, and quickly. While this garnered the support of the common folk, she alienated parts of the upper echelons of Talousian society, who viewed it as barbaric and improper for a lady of such high standing. Today, the Duchess is mostly well-liked, and many workers herald her as a people’s monarch. However, trouble is brewing in Talouse, and it remains to be seen whether Ginevra will lead her family’s ancient legacy to greatness, or be its downfall. \n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
