TAL_duchess_ginerva_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 13th of May, 965 in Talononte\n\n§YBiography§!: Ginevra di Chiazbini was born the eldest child of Duke Giovanni III of Talouse. She grew up in the comfort of the Ducal Palace, and was mostly carefree, consuming the knowledge given to her by her mentors. At an early age, she demonstrated a level of unmatched decisiveness, as well as her infamous temper, which greatly contrasted her patient and naive father. Her pleasant life was turned upside down by the Falcor War, which raged from 985-989 ALB. As the war progressed, she saw her father’s health rapidly deteriorate, alongside the nation’s economy. After the war’s end, there was a glimmer of hope for Ginevra when she married her lifelong sweetheart, the handsome Victor di Altomondi. This time of good feelings was short-lived however, as in 992, her father died of a heart attack, and the young griffoness was crowned Duchess. Ever since then, she has been a staunch pacifist, denouncing war and its horrors. Even though she was a pacifist, her belligerent constitution remained, being further incensed by the post-war economic issues. During the strike of 1003, she famously stormed into Parliament, demanding that a resolution be passed, and quickly. While this garnered the support of the common folk, she alienated parts of the upper echelons of Talousian society, who viewed it as barbaric and improper for a lady of such high standing. Today, the Duchess is mostly well-liked, and many workers herald her as a people’s monarch. However, trouble is brewing in Talouse, and it remains to be seen whether Ginevra will lead her family’s ancient legacy to greatness, or be its downfall. \n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

### Focuses ###
#LRN Voting Focuses
TAL_a_new_start:0 "Elections of 1007"
TAL_a_new_start_desc:0 "Talouse, a land once noble and wealthy, has succumbed to corruption and poverty. The economy continues to falter, and the population grows restless. While Paltori's cabinet has enacted some reforms, many feel that they are not enough, putting forward their own visions for Talouse. With the elections fast approaching, only one of these designs for the small nation will make it out on top."
TAL_vote_for_LRN:0 "Support the LRN"
TAL_vote_for_LRN_desc:0 "The Lega per il Restauro Nazionale (LRN) is one of the more radical factions in Talousian politics. Headed by the eccentric, yet charismatic, Guilio Fetivola, the party seeks to eradicate what they perceive as the coruptions of modernity, and restore the institutions of ancient Talonsia, a successor of the Arantigan Empire that once ruled over Talouse."
TAL_speakout_against_other_partiesandmonarchy_LRN:0 "Denounce Our Rivals"
TAL_speakout_against_other_partiesandmonarchy_LRN_desc:0 "The LRN has been a laughing stock for the corrupt bigwigs and unionists for decades. We must right these slanders, and show the commoners the monsters that have run this country into the ground."
TAL_promote_old_language_and_culture:0 "Remind the People"
TAL_promote_old_language_and_culture_desc:0 "Our ancient ways were glorious, and once brought us great power. However, they have been lost and forgotten and it is up to us to remind the people of what they have lost."
TAL_a_glourious_future:0 "A Glorious Future"
TAL_a_glourious_future_desc:0 "Many griffs doubt our intentions, thinking us, at best, loons. We must convince them that we have their best intentions at heart and that we wish to lead Talouse to the glorious future it deserves."
TAL_by_any_means_necessary:0 "Secure the Ballot"
TAL_by_any_means_necessary_desc:0 "The LRN is not one of the large parties of Talouse. We lack both corporate backing and mainstream attention. If we want a shot at victory, we must use all methods possible to secure it."
TAL_recieve_funds_from_supporters:0 "Donations From Supporters"
TAL_recieve_funds_from_supporters_desc:0 "The LRN is not a corrupt political machine, with billions to spend on a campaign. As such, we will rely on donations from our generous supporters, which is the way things should be."
#PC Voting Focuses
TAL_vote_for_PC:0 "Support the PC"
TAL_vote_for_PC_desc:0 "The Partito Conservatore (PC) is one of Talouse's oldest political parties, and was once at the forefront of Talousian politics. However, the party has lost steam in recent years, known only for its appeal to seniors. The party prides itself on championing traditional values and maintaining good relations with Wingbardy and the rest of the Karthinian Pact."

TAL_vote_for_PL_desc:0 "The Partito Liberale (PL), which had secured the Parliament in 1005, has been the leading party in Talousian politics recently. Led by the well-loved Marco Paltori, the party has been pushing for reform, advocating for greater economic freedom and increased protection for workers. With the Duchess' support, it is well on its way to bringing real change to Talouse."

The front consists of a coalition between the urban syndicalist faction and the Highland communalist faction. Though the coalition is uneasy at times, its goal of drastic economical, societal and political reform in pursuit of the workers' liberation keeps it together."

### Events ###
talouse.1.t:0 "Fetivola's Speech"
talouse.1.d:0 ""I confess that in these times, I weep for Talouse. I weep, for it pains me to see our great nation brought low by the incompetence of our so-called leaders." At the LRN rally in Chiazbeacle, Guilio Fetivola addressed his enraptured audience. Despite the party being at the fringes of Talousian politics, a surprising number of devoted supporters had turned out to show their dedication to Fetivola and the LRN. "Those prominent griffons all bear responsibility for our sad state of affairs, as it was their moral degeneration that made it possible."\n\n"It was the treachery of Emmanuel Talnara, who asks workers to forgo their proud national identity in favour of an imaginary class identity." Fetivola raised a finger for each political rival he listed off. "It was the small-minded cowardice of Antonio di Colliverde, who is content to maintain our nation's exploitation and humiliation. Most of all, it was the avarice of our Prime Minister. Marco Paltori has proven himself willing to sell out the interests of Talouse in exchange for gifts of gold to him and his corporate friends!" The crowd booed fiercely at the mention of Paltori.\n\n"The fact is, our Parliament is infested with unpatriotic griffons and their despicable ilk. As this institution succumbs to corruption and incompetence, our nation is served poorly by its monarch. Duchess Ginevra is a weak ruler, clearly out of her depth and incapable of rising to meet the current challenge. Such is the sad state of Talouse." Fetivola shook his head. "I don't know about you, but I've had enough! Are you content to live your lives as Wingbardian lapdogs?" In response, a deafening shout of "No!" came from the crowd. "Then vote LRN, and together we will forge a new Talouse to regain our lost glory!" Fetivola raised his fist in the air to wild cheers from his supporters."
talouse.1.a:0 "This griffon tells it like it is!"

talouse.2.t:0 "The Forgotten Legacy"
talouse.2.d:0 "In the Peckreit lodge of the Falcor Veterans of Talouse, Guilio Fetivola shook claws and exchanged pleasantries with a stream of griffons excited to meet him. The hall was filled with former soldiers who had come to attend an LRN event where volunteers were giving out copies of Fetivola's book, "Revolt Against the Modern World." After talking individually with a good portion of the crowd, Fetivola flew up on a platform to address them.\n\n"My friends, you all know better than anygriff what it means to be proud of your country, what it means to fight for it. If only more griffons today had your spirit!" Fetivola brought a fist to his chest. "Talouse has a truly glorious legacy. It has always been a bastion of civilisation in the face of barbarian aggression. Unfortunately, this legacy has been forgotten and neglected, as modernity has caused severe moral rot in our society. It saddens me to see that so many Talousians have lost their pride in our nation." Fetivola frowned as grumbles of disapproval came from the crowd.\n\n"This is disgraceful! Talouse can never forget the blood you shed nor the sacrifices you made." Fetivola pointed forcefully at his audience. "As we move forward into the new millenium, we must look to our past and at the same time as our future. It is time to restore our legacy, and take up the glorious mantle of Warden of the South once again!" He raised his fist in the air to raucous cheering from the veterans. "Stand up! Vote LRN, and defend our nation's honour!""
talouse.2.a:0 "We shall rise again!"

talouse.3.t:0 "Every Bit Counts"
talouse.3.d:0 "Guilio Fetivola called to the devoted crowd that remained after the conclusion of an LRN rally. "Friends, in this most crucial endeavour we rely solely on your generous support to fund our operations," pled Fetivola. "So please, give whatever you can!" He gestured towards a large donation bin beside him where supporters swiftly lined up to make their contributions. Most tossed in coins, but others gave anything from pocket watches to glistening jewelry.\n\n"You!" Fetivola heard a weathered voice call to him. In no time, an old griffon in a fine suit was upon him and excitedly shaking his claw. "That was fantastic! In all my years, I don't think I've ever heard a politician speak with your ferocity and conviction. And it's so rare to see a griffon with such respect for our traditions, too. Boreas bless you!"\n\n"Oh, you are far too kind." Fetivola bowed his head modestly. "I am but a humble messenger."\n\n"Nonsense! You are exactly the leader this country needs, and I want to do whatever I can to help you out," said the old griffon. Fetivola subtly tilted his head towards the donation bin. After a short pause, the old griffon nodded in understanding and winked. He rummaged through his pockets before extending a shaky claw and tossing a single idol into the bin.\n\nFetivola's mouth slowly curved into a smile. "Ah... that will do.""
talouse.3.a:0 "It's for a good cause."

talouse.4.t:0 "Strategy"
talouse.4.d:0 "On a pitch black night, a guard patrolled the entrance to a nondescript warehouse, wiping his brow in the damp and heavy air. No moonlight filtered through the oppressive overcast sky, and so he anxiously swept his lantern in a wide arc ahead of him, on the lookout for intruders. Inside the building, a collection of the highest-ranking LRN party lieutenants sat at a table with their leader, a stone-faced Guilio Fetivola. Smoke filled the shadowy air as several of the griffons lit cigarettes while others tapped their claws impatiently. After a long and tense silence, Fetivola leaned forward.\n\n"Gentlegriffs, I have called you here for a sensitive discussion," rumbled Fetivola. "As you know, our mission is absolutely vital. The future of Talouse hangs in the balance. In defence of it, all actions are justified." He frowned and narrowed his eyes. "To be honest with you, our party is in a precarious position. As Talnara continues to poach workers away from us, we will need every edge we can get." Fetivola tapped his claw on a pro-FLT poster on the table in front of him.\n\n"We will have to use unsavoury methods, and obtain help from unsavoury characters." As he spoke, Fetivola pulled out a knife and ran his claw along the edge. "Violence, intimidation, vote rigging; everything is permitted. The only concern is victory. Victory at any cost." As punctuation, he plunged the knife into the table, through the FLT poster. "Can I trust you all to do what is necessary?" Fetivola looked around to his lieutenants and saw no doubt in any of them, only steely-eyed determination."

talouse.70.d:0 ""Dear friends, today I am going to do something a little different. I am going to tell you a story." Under a sunny sky in Talononte, Guilio Fetivola spoke in the shadow of an ancient column. "It is a story of bravery and complacency, of triumph and decline. Most importantly, this story is a true one, for it is your story." Fetivola pointed to the crowd gathered around him as his words took on a wistful air. "This is the story of the sons of Arantigos."\n\n"Long ago, the great conqueror Arantigos swept through this land, defeating the scattered tribes and uniting them under his nephew, Marco Talonostra. Talonostra brought order and initiated many great building projects, including the construction of this very city!" Fetivola raised his claws in wonder. "It was he who gave this land its name: Talonsia. Arantigos bestowed upon it the glorious title of Warden of the South. And so it was the duty and honour of Talonsia to be the stalwart defenders of civilisation."\n\n"The Talonsians there were the happiest and most prosperous griffons on the entire continent! But their ascendency was not to last. Instead of staying true to their traditions, over time they intermingled with barbarians and became corrupted by savagery." Fetivola frowned and shook his head. "They lost their way, and now their glorious empire is nothing but a distant memory. Yes, it is a sad ending." He looked into his audience and saw a sea of gloomy and dejected faces.\n\n"But is it truly an ending?" Fetivola raised an eyebrow. "Because I believe that one day those griffons will become strong again; that they will remember the wisdom of their old ways, and use it to regain their rightful position!" The crowd began to murmur in agreement. "But that is just my belief. In the end, it will be up to you all to make it a reality.""

TAL_coal_clause_desc:0 "The Transnational Mining Clause in Article II of the Charter of the Karthinian Pact allows for Pact members to have resource extraction operations in each other’s territories, as well as the ability to openly transport it without strict border regulation and trade agreements. A section of this Clause refers to the ability of Wingbardian mining corporations to continue their pre-secession operations in other Pact countries. Colloquially referred to as the “Coal Clause” in Talouse, it has allowed for the Wingbardian corporations to operate without restraint in the Talousian Highlands. These companies often engage in unethical practices in the pursuit of profit and efficiency. The lack of benefits to both the workers and the nation, combined with the awful conditions, has led to the Clause being, near universally, viewed with disdain, and most of Talouse’s parties agree that it must be abolished."

TAL_flt_influence_desc:0 "Shortly after the end of the Falcor War, the Fronte Laburista Talusiano was formed, led by Emmanuel Talnara, factory worker turned journalist. The party sought to protest the abhorrent conditions in Talousian industry and appealed to urban laborers and the coal miners in the Highlands. Today, the party consists of a coalition of the majority- syndicalist factory workers and the more unorthodox miner communes. The FLT is said to have its claws wrapped around the neck of the nation’s industry, with almost every factory worker in Talouse seemingly in their pocket. Though its grasp is gentle now, if it is upset, it may choose to tighten its grip, “choking” the industry and, alongside it, the economy."

TAL_declining_economy_desc:0 "During the Falcor War, Wingbardy took out several loans from Talouse, and many Talousians were hired by Wingbardian companies.  When the war ended, Wingbardy couldn’t pay back its debts, and the Wingbardian companies laid off thousands of workers. This drained the Talousian economy, and it has continued to decline ever since. Though there was some recovery in the late 990s, it was not enough, and the Great Strike of 1003 reversed any gains made. Today, Talouse’s economy continues to suffer, primarily from a combination of political deadlock, a reduction in regional trade, and the closure of several young corporations in the fallout of 1003."
