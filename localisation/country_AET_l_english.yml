AET_industrial_1:0 "Begin Industrial Development Plans"
AET_industrial_1_desc:0 "The Greifwaldian industry is extremely lacking at the moment, and poverty is widespread. In order to fix the many issues the nation faces, we should begin drafting plans for the growth of our economy."
AET_infra_development:0 "Forest Roads"
AET_infra_development_desc:0 "Much of the nations countryside consists of forests, which are difficult to traverse. Constructing basic new roads going through the forests, we should be able to transport goods and materials more easily. This will increase our industrial and economic growth in the long run."
AET_oil:0 "Nationalise the Adelart Oil Fields"
AET_oil_desc:0 "Our newly aquired lands in Adelart are rich in oil, but the private sector is not exploiting this to it's fullest capacity. Bringing these oil fields under state control will allow us to maximize the amount of oil that is being extracted."
AET_oil_refineries:0 "Experiment With Synthetic Oil"

AET_oil_p:0 "Black Gold"
AET_oil_p_desc:0 "Our efforts to increase oil extraction have born fruit: Our oil industry is booming, and it doesn't show signs of stopping. It is believed that with increased funding, more synthetic oil can be produced. We will also be able to further expand the Adelart Oil Fields, and take advantage of any source that remains untapped. It is likely that the "Black Gold", as many griffons have named it, will continue to flow for many decades more."
AET_industrial_2:0 "Modern Industrial Methods"
AET_industrial_2_desc:0 "With the advent of heavy machinery in recent decades, new industrial methods are being devised by scientist and industrialists. We should take advantage of this, and implement revolutionary new methods of production. This would certainly benefit our industry as a whole."
AET_steel_and_tungsten:0 "Expand the Cloudguard Mines"
AET_steel_and_tungsten_desc:0 "The hills in Cloudguard have always been rich in all kinds of metal, but this has not yet been exploited to its fullest extent. We should fix this as soon as possible, and significantly expand the scale of our mining operations in Cloudguard."
AET_steel_road:0 "Roads in the Forests"
AET_steel_road_desc:0 "Following the success of our new mining operations in Cloudguard, more materials are being transported all over the nation. We must now expand our forest road network again, in order to ease the strain on our infrastructure."
AET_more_steel:0 "Dig for Iron"
AET_more_steel_desc:0 "While doing construction work in Twöchanerwald for our recent infrastructure expansion, some engineers came across a small iron vein in the forest.

AET_arms_building:0 "Develop the National Arms Industry"
AET_arms_building_desc:0 "In recent decades the World has grown to be very dangerous. In order to secure our sovereignty, a military buildup is in order. Investing in heavy industry should allow us to produce all the equipment we need to arm our soldiers."
AET_modern_society:0 "Modernise the Industrial Sector"
AET_modern_society_desc:0 "Despite our recent industrial growth, we are still lagging behind in some areas. We should procide additional funds to scientists in order to create a truly modern industrial sector."
AET_army_1:0 "Begin Reforming the Army"
AET_army_1_desc:0 "After the third or forth time someone tried to kill our beloved ruler from so far away they were but a speck on the horizon it came to our attention that our military was behind the times. We shall fix that."
AET_army_2:0 "Modern Support Equipment"
AET_army_2_desc:0 "Modern support equipment is more than a cot and a campfire, it's bandages, radios, shovels, binoculars, trucks, repair kits, and the training to use all of that. We have binoculars, but we could have much more."
AET_army_3:0 "Modern Rifles"
AET_army_3_desc:0 "Smokeless powder is an amazing. Not only does it does exactly what it sounds like, produce thrust for a bullet without generating much smoke, but it also produces enough power to throw rounds out to unprecidented ranges. How did we skip on this inovation for so long?"
AET_army_4:0 "Cannons from Abroad"
AET_army_4_desc:0 "Sometimes signing a cheque for something is easier than designing it yourself. That's the case with Griefwald's artillery. Contracting a foreign actor to get our guns up to snuff shall do much to improve our position."
AET_army_5:0 "Recylce the Old Guns"
AET_army_5_desc:0 "As tempting as it is to throw away all our old weapons for the shiny new ones we should keep cost concerns in mind. If we can adapt an old blackpowder rifle for smokeless cartrages for half the cost of building a new rifle from scratch why not take it? If nothing else it should cut down on training time."
AET_army_6:0 "Guns of the West"
AET_army_6_desc:0 "Artillery, the backbone of modern war. We new and better varients of these formidable weapons. Of that there can be no doubt."

AET_army_8_desc:0 "Our military's continued success depends are newer and better technology. We must never again lag behind the curve. To that end we must allow our scientists to go about their business without fear of draft letters coming in the mail."
AET_army_9:0 "Develop a Doctrine"
AET_army_9_desc:0 "We have a lot of great guns, but that's only half the equation. Information is ammunition, after all. It's time we gained the knowledge of how to properly deploy our arms."
AET_army_10:0 "Luna Nova Experiments"
AET_army_10_desc:0 "A group of our finest scientist-mages recently traveled to the Luna Nova Academy in Equestria. There they participated in an experient to create enchanted crystals to power a Light Amplification by Simulated Emission of Radiation device. They have since returned our lands and brought with them the knowledge of what they learned. Apparently believing in ourselves is our magic. Nice!"
AET_army_13:0 "Enchanting!"
AET_army_13_desc:0 "They were right! Believing in ourselves was our magic, and it's time we rediscovered exactally what that means. We shall forge a shining chariot to break through the heavens with our magic! ... Metaphorically, of course."
AET_army_11:0 "An Army on Wheels"
AET_army_11_desc:0 "While griffon-pulled carts are great for airborne operations they leave something to be desired when each member of an artillery team needs a dedicated chiropractor. Motorized units promise to resolve those issues. All we have to go is get griffons to accept moving on the ground."
AET_army_12:0 "Armoured Tractors and Tanks"
AET_army_12_desc:0 "The next evolution of vehicular combat is to put armor onboard to resist small arms fire. Of course, the obvious counter is to shoot them with big guns, like artillery. Therefor we must preemptively counter this counter with better engines and even more armor."
AET_army_14:0 "Establish the FMA"
AET_army_14_desc:0 "The Falcontown Military Academy has been proposed as the solution to the ever growing needs of our army to inovate. Perhaps it is time we do this. After all, knowing is half the battle."
AET_state_air:0 "Reclaim the Sky"
AET_state_air_desc:0 "For centuries griffons have ruled the skies, but now our people are fat and lazy, and the sky is dominated by fantastic flying machines. We must reclaim out rightful place in the air, starting by building expanded airports to accomdate today's fixed-wing aircraft."
AET_air_1:0 "Hire New Pilots"
AET_air_1_desc:0 "Contrary to expectations, we can't just throw our overweight subjects into aircraft and tell them that its their new mobility scooter. We will actually have to hire griffons with specialized training to fly these things. Lesson learned there."
AET_air_6:0 "Form Paratrooper Regiments"
AET_air_6_desc:0 "As technology advances and battle lines become ever more clear some of our number begin to see the value of specialized infantry trained to use transport aircraft to insert behind those lines. These 'paratroopers' should prove exceptionally useful for sowign confusion in enemy lines."
AET_air_7:0 "Jet Experiments"
AET_air_7_desc:0 "An article published in a scientific journal years ago proposed the idea of using compressed air being funneled into a constant explosion as a means of propulsion. Perhaps it would be wise to invest in a better translation, and experiments to test the validity of the theory afterward."
AET_air_2:0 "A New Pair of Wings"
AET_air_2_desc:0 "Light lighter aircraft are the most basic of combat capable aircraft that are actually meant to engage in combat, and it's time we invested into research for that."
AET_air_5:0 "Wings of Steel"
AET_air_5_desc:0 "Heavy fighters! Is there anything they can't do? Strategic bombing and dodging. Never mind that though, think of the versitility!"
AET_air_3:0 "A New Pair of Talons"
AET_air_3_desc:0 "It's time the ground griffs were given support from the air. What kind of support? Only the closest."
AET_air_4:0 "Talons of Steel"
AET_air_4_desc:0 "The time has come to remind our enemies what it feels like to have their cities reduced to ash. Granted, on this continent we're all pretty much used to it by now, but not being able to shoot back is a new experience!"
AET_navy_1:0 "Marry the Sea"
AET_navy_1_desc:0 "With our newfound access to the sea one thing is clear, we must do more than flirt with naval power. We must take it out to dinner, treat it right, and buy it a nice engagement ring. It's time we settle down to a lifetime commitment with the ocean."
AET_navy_10:0 "Expand the Dockyards"
AET_navy_10_desc:0 "It's time we applied all the new experience we got designing ships to expand the dockyards and make our navy even greater."
AET_navy_2:0 "A Small Fleet"
AET_navy_2_desc:0 "We love the ocean, is that not clear? However, it would be more advantagous take things slow. Let us buy an appartment first, then move on to something grander."
AET_navy_3:0 "Floating Fortresses"
AET_navy_3_desc:0 "Go big, or go home. We love the ocean, right? Well it's time we proved that by building the grandest fleet the world has ever known. Why buy a mansion when you can buy a palace, eh?"
AET_navy_4:0 "Deep Under the Sea"
AET_navy_4_desc:0 "Up on the shore they work all day. Indeed, out in the sun they slave away, and all while we're devoting full time to floating under the sea. Ain't the sub life grand?"
AET_navy_5:0 "A Surface Fleet"
AET_navy_5_desc:0 "Submarines are great at many things, but tracking other submarines is not one of them. To counter the enemy's sub we shall have to build up a destroyer fleet."
AET_navy_7:0 "Escort Buildup"
AET_navy_7_desc:0 "Torpedeo capable fast moving vessels serve a wide variety of roles easily, and thus form the great majority of any fleet. It's time we joined the fun."
AET_navy_8:0 "Heavy Cruiser Experiments"
AET_navy_8_desc:0 "Heavy crusiers and battlecrusiers form a distinctive niche of vessels with large caliber guns that can actually move at a fair clip. We should get at least one new model of these vessels."
AET_navy_9:0 "A Storm of Steel"
AET_navy_9_desc:0 "Our shells shall blot out the sky, and shall be delivered by grand new battleships. None shall doubt our conviction to secure the seas."
