 ### Imperial Events ###
 imperial.0.t:0 "Under a Blue Sky"
 imperial.0.d:0 "Republicans to the North, Aquileia to the West, Wingbardy to the South, Ippasia to the East and the aristocracy in the court... Enemies on all sides, truly the house of Grover has seen better days. We once ruled all the lands where Griffons dared to fly and look at us now... trapped within our gilded cage of an Imperial capital with even our advisors against us! To make matters worse the Emperor is already one paw in the grave already, and his son is underage, a fact many of our loyal "advisors" shall seek to use to their own advantage... and there is nothing we can do about it, but wait for it to happen..."
 imperial.0.a:0 "Truly dark times are ahead..."
 imperial.1.t:0 "A Train Trip"
 imperial.1.d:0 "The Emperor has decided that despite his failing health he shall tour what remains of the Empire via our new railroad network in an effort to convince both the nobility and the commoners that he is in fact still alive. Despite the best wishes of both his doctors and his advisors, his majesty has already begun touring the imperial provinces..."
 imperial.1.a:0 "What's the worst that could happen?"
 imperial.2.t:0 "A Perfectly Normal Day"
 imperial.2.d:0 "All seemed to have been going well in court today as the Emperor met noble after noble, listening to their petty complaints, pretending he's listening to their pleas and overall trying to not fall asleep... until the Emperor collapsed without warning. He was quickly rushed to his private chambers and is currently being taken care of by the Empire's finest medical experts."
 imperial.2.a:0 "Oh bollocks..."
 imperial.3.t:0 "The Emperor is Dead"
 imperial.3.d:0 "Unfortunately after nearly a month of treatments, therapy and something called hashish Emperor Grover the Fifth of his name was embraced by the claws of Boreas at the young age of 54... Due to his only son and heir Prince Grover VI not being of the age in which he is capable of rulling the country himself, a regency council consiting of Nobles, Merchant Princes and Church Officials shall take over the apparatus of state until a more suitable solution is found..."
 imperial.3.a:0 "Boreas save us all!"
 imperial.4.t:0 "On the Matter of the Regency"
 imperial.4.d:0 "The first real issue the Regency Council is facing is whom exactly it should allow into the council itself. The nobility lead by Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw have proposed that only those of high birth should be able to attend and vote upon matters of importance in the Council, which would effectively exclude the majority of both merchant princes and the various church officials from voting. What no one was expecting however was the various religious organization within our country uniting under the banner of Archon Eros VII of the Borean Temple and declaring that not only should the entire council be able to vote, but that they should also open their doors to influental commoners."
 imperial.4.a:0 "Only the Highborn shall vote!"
 imperial.4.b:0 "Open our Doors to the Commoners!"
 imperial.5.t:0 "On the Matter Commoner Rights"
 imperial.5.d:0 "The Second issue we face is: how exactly should the average commoner be treated within the Empire? The nobility pompous as ever has stated that those whom live upon their land are their property and shall remain as such. On the other claw Archon Eros has proposed that we gradually give rights to all Griffons, lowborn or not."
 imperial.5.a:0 "Power to the Aritocracy!"
 imperial.5.b:0 "Power to the People!"
 imperial.22.t:0 "The Empire Strikes Back"
 imperial.22.d:0 "After a series of reforms, miraculous victories and countless rebellions, the long suffering Griffonian Empire has under the guidance of the Council of Three managed to reclaim the Griffonian Imperial Heartlands. While many of the still independant Griffon Kingdoms were hoping that the three Archons would be satasfied with the realm they've carved out for themselves it seems that this will not be case, as today Archon Eros VII with his young protégé Emperor Grover VI in tow made a speech announcing that the Griffonian Empire shall not stop until all Griffons are beneath it's banner."
 imperial.22.a:0 "It seems there is still hope for the Empire..."
