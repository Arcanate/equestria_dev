 ### Imperial Events ###
 imperial.0.t:0 "Under a Blue Sky"
 imperial.0.d:0 "Republicans to the North, Aquileia to the West, Wingbardy to the South, Ippasia to the East and the aristocracy in the court... Enemies on all sides, truly the house of Grover has seen better days. We once ruled all the lands where Griffons dared to fly and look at us now... trapped within our gilded cage of an Imperial capital with even our advisors against us! To make matters worse the Emperor is already one paw in the grave already, and his son is underage, a fact many of our loyal "advisors" shall seek to use to their own advantage... and there is nothing we can do about it, but wait for it to happen..."
 imperial.0.a:0 "Truly dark times are ahead..."
 imperial.1.t:0 "A Train Trip"
 imperial.1.d:0 "The Emperor has decided that despite his failing health he shall tour what remains of the Empire via our new railroad network in an effort to convince both the nobility and the commoners that he is in fact still alive. Despite the best wishes of both his doctors and his advisors, his majesty has already begun touring the imperial provinces..."
 imperial.1.a:0 "What's the worst that could happen?"
 imperial.2.t:0 "A Perfectly Normal Day"
 imperial.2.d:0 "All seemed to have been going well in court today as the Emperor met noble after noble, listening to their petty complaints, pretending he's listening to their pleas and overall trying to not fall asleep... until the Emperor collapsed without warning. He was quickly rushed to his private chambers and is currently being taken care of by the Empire's finest medical experts."
 imperial.2.a:0 "Oh bollocks..."
 imperial.3.t:0 "The Emperor is Dead"
 imperial.3.d:0 "Unfortunately after nearly a month of treatments, therapy and something called hashish Emperor Grover the Fifth of his name was embraced by the claws of Boreas at the young age of 54... Due to his only son and heir Prince Grover VI not being of the age in which he is capable of rulling the country himself, a regency council consiting of Nobles, Merchant Princes and Church Officials shall take over the apparatus of state until a more suitable solution is found..."
 imperial.3.a:0 "Boreas save us all!"
 imperial.4.t:0 "On the Matter of the Regency"
 imperial.4.d:0 "The first real issue the Regency Council is facing is whom exactly it should allow into the council itself. The nobility lead by Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw have proposed that only those of high birth should be able to attend and vote upon matters of importance in the Council, which would effectively exclude the majority of both merchant princes and the various church officials from voting. What no one was expecting however was the various religious organization within our country uniting under the banner of Archon Eros VII of the Borean Temple and declaring that not only should the entire council be able to vote, but that they should also open their doors to influental commoners."
 imperial.4.a:0 "Only the Highborn shall vote!"
 imperial.4.b:0 "Open our Doors to the Commoners!"
 imperial.5.t:0 "On the Matter Commoner Rights"
 imperial.5.d:0 "The Second issue we face is: how exactly should the average commoner be treated within the Empire? The nobility pompous as ever has stated that those whom live upon their land are their property and shall remain as such. On the other claw Archon Eros has proposed that we gradually give rights to all Griffons, lowborn or not."
 imperial.5.a:0 "Power to the Aritocracy!"
 imperial.5.b:0 "Power to the People!"
 imperial.6.t:0 "The Great Betrayal"
 imperial.6.d:0 "After nearly a month since we managed to secure the Regency Council for our cause it seemed that after the initial power struggle that things were finally calming down in the Capital. Unfortunately this it seems shall not be the case, as today during a council meeting Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw and several of her allies simply walked out, followed by the lords of Bronzehill, Feathisia and Greifenheim. Hours later they all announced their formal secession from the Empire..."
 imperial.6.a:0 "Traitors! Every Single one of them!"
 imperial.7.t:0 "The Sad Truth"
 imperial.7.d:0 "The sad truth is we simply cannot hope to fight againist Eros on our own, if we intend to survive this mess we must convice our fellow lords to work together in case the Empire decides to attack."
 imperial.7.a:0 "Send out the messengers"
 imperial.7.b:0 "We can fight Griffonia on our own, thank you very much"
 imperial.8.t:0 "An Invitation"
 imperial.8.d:0 "It seems that the Duchess has once more called upon us to assist her.

 imperial.14.t:0 "An Offer"

While we could most likely veto this decision in the Regency Council and garner the support of what few of the nobility is left in it chances are the Archons won't take no for an anwser.

 imperial.19.t:0 "Yaledom Defies Us"
 imperial.19.d:0 "Graf Mikusian always the one for theatrics has decided to deny our little request. Seems that the only way Yaledom will rejoin the Empire is by the sword."

 imperial.20.t:0 "The Katerin Affair"
 imperial.20.d:0 "The Prince of Katerin and his legion of glorified hillbillies have once more proven to be idiots, as they've decided to not rejoin the Empire. While we could let this slide, let's face it we won't."

 imperial.21.t:0 "The Obvious Suspect"
 imperial.21.d:0 "To no one's suprise our former ally in the Regency Council the Baron of Angriver has decided to tell us to go sod ourselves. While this was an expected result he could have at least been somewhat more polite."

 imperial.24.t:0 "Facing the Facts"
 imperial.24.d:0 "We must face the facts, we simply cannot stand against Gabriela and her lackies should they decide to attack. We must unite with our fellow lords and fight the heathens to the West."

 imperial.35.b:0 "He's an idiot... but he is still family..."
 imperial.36.t:0 "Feathisia Politely Refuses"

 imperial.40.t:0 "Fighting Illiteracy"

The ceremony itself was a beautiful affair, with the Archonate Choir providing all the soundtrack necessary, Archon Eros the now former Lord Regent gave a short speech, calling forth visions of a wonderful and glorious future for the Empire. The crown was rested upon its rightful owner’s head, and the crowd present cheered their new Emperor. Then, all were asked for silence, as Grover gave his speech: “Friends. Brothers, Sisters: We have finally returned our Holy Griffon Empire from the darkness of this Generation. Still unaccepting of this, our foes stand against us from all sides. But this matters not. With our gods on our side, none can stand against us, truly. Forward, unto the dawn, my Brothers and Sisters! And we shall never go back!”"

Our past years, the years of my childhood, have been long and difficult. We have been made to fight, militarily, economically, and psychologically, against all odds and all outside threats to our way of life. But today is not a day of war. Today is a day of success, and of peace. Victory, and of serenity. Today marks the end of our past, and the beginning of our bright future. The Empire has returned, and together, my friends- my people- we shall lead Griffonia into a new golden age, of peace and prosperity!"
