TEM_sacrifice_berry:0 "A Tyrant's Reward"
TEM_sacrifice_berry_desc:0 "Victory is ours at last! The War of Purification is over, and Ahuizotl reigns as the supreme ruler over the Southern Jungles. Now, all that remains of the old regime is it's leader itself- Larry Barry. Of course, now that all of the Jungle is united under Ahuizotl and the hated South East Empire is dead and buried, it is time to bury Mr. Berry alongside the corpse of his so-called empire. And, of course, the old traditions are quite suitable for such a thing- and a defeated enemy, after all, is the best sort of sacrifice."

TEM_a_new_army_shall_rise:0 "The Army Of Ahuizotl"
TEM_a_new_army_shall_rise_desc:0 "What Ahuizotl gathered together during the War of Purification can hardly be called an army. No, it was in truth, merely a gathering of warriors desperate enough to band together to form some sort of hodge-podge army, with which Ahuizotl skillfully led to defeat the South-East Empire... However, now that the Empire is gone and Ahuizotl has been successful in forming the Aztlan Empire, a proper army is required- and looking fowards to the future, a proper navy and air force. Even though most of the tribesponies don't actually know what a plane or a warship is or looks like. Still, Ahuizotl's grand plan calls for a grand military- not a grand army- and that means including the other branches, despite they not exist yet- soon, of course, this will change."
TEM_loot_what_remains:0 "Salvage What Remains"
TEM_loot_what_remains_desc:0 "With the war's end, the fledgeling Aztlani military now has access to all of the old armories dotting the jungles, as well as all of the leftovers from Baltimare itself. With plenty of untapped reserves still located within the secure armories, we may even discover some weapons we've never seen before, or something that could help us manufacture new and bloody weaponry for our army."
TEM_steal_the_cannons:0 "Repurpose The Artillery"
TEM_steal_the_cannons_desc:0 "While a majority of our artillery during the war was either lost or destroyed due to the nature of jungle fighting, Baltimare's now defunct military bases still have a good amount of stored artillery- artillery that we can repurpose to use for our own ends, and can study for further advancements in artillery guns themselves."
TEM_all_shall_serve:0 "All Shall Do Their Part"
TEM_all_shall_serve_desc:0 "It is understood by everyone that not all are fit to fight as warriors on the front line. However, all of our people have use in military matters- whether they're behind a rifle or not. Instead, we can use these people behind the lines, as support for those fighting on the front. They can treat the wounded, deliver supplies, and so on. All must serve in preparation for the coming war- whether they are warrior material or not."
TEM_tactical_sappers:0 "Sapper Tactics"
TEM_tactical_sappers_desc:0 "During our war with Baltimare, we discovered the doctrine of using specialized units for roles such as reconaissance and engineering. These units, called Sappers, can be a boon to our own modernizing forces as we continue forward. Utilizing these people and putting emphasis on training them would be a wise choice."
TEM_learn_from_them:0 "The Lessons Of Our Oppressors"
TEM_learn_from_them_desc:0 "While our oppressors in Baltimare ultimately lost the war, there is still a great deal we can learn from them on the art of war. To ignore their lessons- the lessons of the machine gun, of the automobile; the bomb and even the flamethower- would be a great disservice to those who died to give us the chance to study these hated weapons."
TEM_meritocracy:0 "Merit Not Blood"
TEM_meritocracy_desc:0 "Blood is for flowing freely to the gods, not deciding on one's role in society. Instead, we shall promote those who truly deserve it, based on their merits and skills, rather than their bloodlines. By doing so, we can ensure that our leaders are professional and intelligent, capable of defeating all our enemies."
TEM_the_wonders_of_cars:0 "The Wonders Of Automobiles"
TEM_the_wonders_of_cars_desc:0 "Automobiles are wonderful things- and fantastic tools for war. They make transporting supplies and warriors so much easier! We should research these strange tools further, so as to produce as many as possible for as many reasons as possible."
TEM_the_glorious_tanks:0 "The Chimalli"
TEM_the_glorious_tanks_desc:0 "These wonderful large metal boxes are very good at killing things, as we discovered whilst fighting the hated communists. Obviously, we should begin manufacturing our own, so as to kill as many enemies as possible. Even better, we can stick artillery cannons on them and kill tons of enemies in a single shot!"
TEM_code_talkers:0 "The Huallauhatlatollamini"
TEM_code_talkers_desc:0 "Our Huallauhatlatollamini- or Code Talkers- will be a great aid to our warriors in battle and in peace. Well versed in the new technology called the radio, these talented ponies will have the task of coordinating warriors during battle, passing on information, and during times of peace, recruiting more ponies to our growing military. The addition of them speaking in our native languages confusing our enemies isn't too bad, either."
TEM_bat_regiments_f:0 "The Tzinacatl Divisions"
TEM_bat_regiments_f_desc:0 "Derived from the Moonsingers that originally aided us in the war, we can develop dedicated Tzinactl divisions, dedicated to night fighting. These divisions will make up the bulk of our combat units when night falls, and will be a boon against all our enemies regardless of time of day, such is the tenacity of the Tzinactl. The pretender Nightmare Moon's loss is our gain."
TEM_greatest_army_in_the_world:0 "Ahuizotl's Blessing"
TEM_greatest_army_in_the_world_desc:0 "Following a great sacrifice from the golden steps of Tenochtitlan, the blessing of Ahuizotl to our army- as the Greatest Army in the World- will inspire our warriors to fight better, for longer, in more difficult conditions. As well, it will have the added benefit of drawing new warriors to our great army. After all, anyone who wants to prove themselves a great warrior will be rather inclined to join an army endorsed by our nation's great leader."

TEM_purify_baltimare:0 "Purify Baltimare"
TEM_purify_baltimare_desc:0 "With the end of the Purification War, we must of course, purify the hated seat of Berry's so called empire as well- Baltimare. We shall make a grand sacrifice to the Sun and Moon, of ten thousand enemies; their blood will flow across the stones of the city's roads, and purify them of Communist taint. Blessings will be given freely by the Sun and Moon, so proud shall they be of our victory over the vile Reds! A new age shall dawn upon the Jungles."
TEM_destroy_the_resistance:0 "Destroy The Heretics"
TEM_destroy_the_resistance_desc:0 "With our acquiring of Baltimare's lands, we must now begin to look inwards. There exists within our Empire, disgustingly, those who believe two horses, Celestia and Luna, raise the Sun and Moon! Such a heresy is terrible, disgusting, and must be removed at any cost! We will crush this heresy before it spreads it's taint and lies any further amongst our righteous people."
TEM_destroy_the_socialists:0 "Annihilate The Remnants"
TEM_destroy_the_socialists_desc:0 "Baltimare has fallen, and with it, the disease of Communism in the Southern Jungles. However, there remain remnants of this hated ideology; those who would believe themselves capable of bringing it back into rulership later down the line, when our memories are weaker. We must disabuse these plagues upon our people before they get any serious ideas in their heads- Preferably at gunpoint, or upon a holy altar with sacrificial knife."
TEM_neiguatl_law_code:0 "Integrate Neighuatl Law Codes"
TEM_neiguatl_law_code_desc:0 "The Neighua Law code is well made, and has stood proudly in our exile from the rest of the Jungles. There is no good reason we should not install and integrate this code into our Empire, as it has stood the test of time, and is still relevant even in this modern day and age."
TEM_blood_sacrifice:0 "The Blood Must Flow"
TEM_blood_sacrifice_desc:0 "One way or another, Blood Must Flow. In war, in battle, in fight. We care not whether the blood is ours or the enemy's, only that it flows freely as steel clashes with steel, and guns rend life from those before them. Our warriors are brave, and true, and throw themselves into battle with reckless abandon- and through them, The Blood Flows."
TEM_rebuild_the_temples:0 "Rebuild The Temples"
TEM_rebuild_the_temples_desc:0 "The Temples of Old have mostly been torn down in our peoples' absence from locales such as Baltimore or Saltlickingham. However, we can readily fix this, what with the large amount of priests of the old ways filling the ranks of our army. We will simply make it a project of the people, to rebuild our holy sites of old, in preparation for our rituals and return to our way of life."
TEM_bring_back_blood_magic:0 "The Return Of The Old Ways"
TEM_bring_back_blood_magic_desc:0 "The Old ways of worship have, for the most part, fallen by the wayside due to reasons such as exile to the deepest parts of the jungle. With our new Empire's rise however, we need not worry about any reprisals against our religion anymore, especially with Ahuizotl in command of our great nation. It is now time for our old ways of worship to return to the forefront, so that the blood of those chosen for sacrifice may bless our people."
TEM_bat_morality:0 "Tzinacatl Morals"
TEM_bat_morality_desc:0 "The Tzinacatl- that is, Thestral, in modern Equestrian parlance- of our great empire are our worshipers of the Moon and the nighttime that follows it. Having rejected the pretender Nightmare Moon as the Moon incarnate when she refused to lift a hoof to help the Tzinacatl of the Jungles, they have instead thrown their lot in with the Empire, and have focused on integrating with our people. Their morals are different than our own, but still a welcome addition to the Aztlan Empire."
TEM_codify_the_tenents:0 "Codify The Faith"
TEM_codify_the_tenents_desc:0 "In the old days, the Moonspeakers passed on their faith and traditions via word of mouth, in Oral traditions, as was the norm of the time. However, with the modernization of our new Empire, a new way is available to our Moonspeakers to pass on their traditions and faiths. By writing a Codex of the particulars of their faith and praise of the moon, the faith can be centralized and legitimatized, and thus, made stronger."
TEM_return_of_the_blood_priests:0 "The New Ezhuahuacatl"
TEM_return_of_the_blood_priests_desc:0 "In the days of old, Ezhuahuacatl were our priests; our holy leaders in the rituals of our people. While this shall not change, as sacrifice is still a central tenet of our faith, the new Ezhuahuacatl are not only priests, but warriors as well, leading their ponies into the fray from the front, where they can better gain the favor of the Sun and Moon."
TEM_tame_the_ursas:0 "Tame The Ursas"
TEM_tame_the_ursas_desc:0 "Truly, our people are great. In fact, our empire is so great, we are capable of taming the great beasts of legend, the Ursas. To tame the star bears is no easy feat, of course, but the glory and honor from doing so makes us unmatched in the eyes of our foes! And truly, to ride into battle on a giant star bear will terrify our foes so greatly they'll wish to leave the field before the battle's even begun."
TEM_no_more_brother_wars:0 "United Now And Forever"
TEM_no_more_brother_wars_desc:0 "Once at each other's throats, the Sun and Moon and it's worshipers are now one entity; one living, breathing being. Their people are now one; once allies of necessity, spurred on by desperation, the worshipers of the Sun and Moon are now entwined in their faiths and beliefs, and have made our people as a whole all the more stronger for it."

TEM_recalibrate_the_economy:0 "Recalibrate The Economy"
TEM_recalibrate_the_economy_desc:0 "Calling our measly barter system an economy really does the word economy a great injustice. Now that we've taken control of Baltimare though and kicked out the hated Marksists, we can really turn our economy into something worth mentioning. It will take some time and effort to do so, but it is well worth the effort to bring us to a competitive level. "
TEM_use_the_rubber:0 "Expand The Rubber Plantations"
TEM_use_the_rubber_desc:0 "The rubber plantations in the jungles are mostly hold-overs from the old days of Equestria's original conception. Now that we're being proactive about creating our own economy though, there's no reason we shouldn't expand these plantations, so as to have a rare material that we can put out to market- truly, Capitalism at it's finest."
TEM_population_relocation:0 "Relocate The Populace"
TEM_population_relocation_desc:0 "So as to better control the populaces of the two large cities of the southern jungles that we've captured from our enemies, Baltimare and Stableside, we should relocate large sections of their populaces. By doing so, we can ensure that any resistance groups formed by former citizens of these cities are spread thin and minimized- as well, it will help us to bolster some of our less populated territories, willingly or not."
TEM_rebuild_the_roads:0 "The New Otli System"
TEM_rebuild_the_roads_desc:0 "The new Otli road system is a splended idea for centralizing our new Empire, so as to allow fast transit between our major cities and the borders of our Empire. Sure, it may take a few corpses to finish, but you can't make an omlette without killing a few ponies. Or something like that."
TEM_airroads:0 "The Cuauhtzalantli"
TEM_airroads_desc:0 "Our people have a saying- Cuauhtzalantli, meaning, Among Trees. We have never had a so-called Air Force in the past, and during the war of Purification, any of these winged beasts were destroyed, for the sins of burning our homes in the jungles. Times, however, are changing, and our ponies must be able to fly among the trees. And so, we must form our own air force, and manifest our our Cuauhtzalantli."
TEM_copy_their_methods:0 "Learn The Enemy's Methods"
TEM_copy_their_methods_desc:0 "Say what you will about the hated Commmunists, their production skills were practically unmatched in the south. Whilst we should reject all their ideals and fanatics, learning their methods of production would be harmless, and would help us maintain production levels to outfit our new, massive army."
TEM_develop_our_own:0 "Teach Our People"
TEM_develop_our_own_desc:0 "Our people are quite behind with the times, having lived deep in the jungles for hundreds of years now. As such, we will have to make plans to rectify this backwardness, and enlighten our people in the technologies of the modern world. This means establishing new schools, new lines of thought, and new institutes of research. No easy feat, to be sure, but in doing so, our people will be all the better for it."
TEM_rebuild_the_factories:0 "Rebuild The Factories"
TEM_rebuild_the_factories_desc:0 "The War of Purification was bloody, as all wars should be, but it came with the downside that many of the local factories in Baltimare were destroyed in the fighting. In order to have a productive industry going forward, these factories must be rebuilt, as quickly as possible."
TEM_repurpose_the_factories:0 "Weapons For An Army"
TEM_repurpose_the_factories_desc:0 "In much the same way as the industrial factories, we may have been... overzealous in our cleansing of Baltimare and it's hated government. That said, we now have the industrial capability to repair the old arms factories of the cities, so as to better fuel our growing war machine."
TEM_everything_for_war:0 "The Forges Of War"
TEM_everything_for_war_desc:0 "Our industry is to be geared for a single purpose: War. And War some more. War is our people's way of life, and spilling blood is our praise to the heavens. Our industrial might will mirror this, with the rapid production of deadly weapons with which to wage war. Our armaments will flow like an unending stream of blood- eager to spill it for the Sun and Moon."
TEM_penal_builders:0 "Penal Construction Brigades"
TEM_penal_builders_desc:0 "We still somehow have left-over slaves that were prisoners taken from our enemies that haven't been sacrificed to the Sun yet. How this happened, no one knows exactly, but we might as well make use of them while they're still useful and we try to schedule new sacrifices. In the meantime, these slaves can act as building teams. Whether they survive their work or not doesn't really matter, as any survivors of the dangerous projects we put them on will just end up on a sacrificial altar anyways, so we can force them to do the difficult and dangerous jobs we ourselves don't want to do."
TEM_economy_fixed:0 "A Calibrated Economy"
TEM_economy_fixed_desc:0 "It has been quite some time since the War of Purification that damaged our economy. Since then, we've had plenty of time to rebuild our industry from the ground up, and tool it to our ends. Our Industry and Economy is the greatest on this continent, and we shall show it's glory to the world!"

TEM_the_final_war:0 "The Great Yaoyotl"
TEM_the_final_war_desc:0 "To the north lie our Great Enemies: Equestria, who did nothing to stop the Communist persecution of our people, and the Communists themselves, whose own sins are greater. However, Equestria stands in our way to reach these people, and we have not forgotten that Celestia and Nightmare Moon have pretended to be our gods for thousands of years- a heresy that must be corrected in our people's way- with the blood of our enemies."
TEM_the_new_sun_god:0 "A New God"
TEM_the_new_sun_god_desc:0 "The war is finally over, and the pretender gods are destroyed. Our leader Ahuizotl- the True God- who has vanquished the Sun and Moon and bent them to his will."
