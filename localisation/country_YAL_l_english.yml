 #Focuses#
 ###INDUSTRY###
 YAL_subsidize_industry:0 "Subsidise Industry"
 YAL_subsidize_industry_desc:0 "Although some of our more radical economists despise any government interference into the economy, analyists have shown that there is much to gain from subsidising our industries. A few key investments will give us the opportunity to innovate new production methods which will give our factories an advantage over foreign competitors."

 YAL_yale_factories:0 "Revitalise Yale"
 YAL_yale_factories_desc:0 "Yale, the old capital, and namesake of our country, has slowly been eclipsed by Greenback as the heart of òur nation. However, the city lays at a strategic location for regional trade and still has potential to grow its industry. An investment in Yale now would surely see the city regain some of its former splendour."

 YAL_greenback_factories:0 "Invest in the Capital"
 YAL_greenback_factories_desc:0 "Greenback has been the beating heart of Yale since the industrial revolution kicked off. Many of the old cities in Griffonia, like Yale,  grew decadent and new centres of industry and culture took their place. With the city already being the home of our most important companies, we ought to incentivise them to expand their operations in the city."

 YAL_develop_yale_ironworks:0 "Yale Ironworks"
 YAL_develop_yale_ironworks_desc:0 "Yale’s industry is experiencing a healthy growth and its new factories are creating their own demands. Steel is key in keeping our industrial base operating and it would be prudent to invest in ironworks on site. A steady supply of iron would surely make the city even more industrious."

 YAL_tungsten_production:0 "Open the Tungsten Mine"
 YAL_tungsten_production_desc:0 "Tungsten is usually mined in small underground extraction sites. However, an open tungsten mine would mean a way higher yield of this strategically important resource, seeing as shells made from this material are essential for modern artillery pieces. Sure, this won’t look pretty, but the locals will surely be swayed by the creation of more jobs. "

 YAL_develop_greenback_ironworks:0 "Greenback Steel"
 YAL_develop_greenback_ironworks_desc:0 "Weapons, cars, and many other goods are made from steel. We are lucky enough to have access to enough mines  to supply us with the necessary ores. However, our steel output can be raised even higher by funding another steel mill in the capital."

 YAL_aluminium_production:0 "Secure Aluminium Production"
 YAL_aluminium_production_desc:0 "Although steel keeps heavy industry moving, aluminium is needed for some high-tech products such as airplanes. By investing in aluminium production, alongside our existing steel infastructure, our industry will be ready for the demands of the future."

 YAL_yale_infrastructure:0 "Highways to Yale"
 YAL_yale_infrastructure_desc:0 "Yale’s infrastructure has been neglected for years, since the area lacked the heavy industrial traffic of Greenback. It is imperative that Yale gets properly integrated into our transportation network, so that the southwest will also be open for future industrial development."

 YAL_frontline_infrastructure:0 "Rails to the North"
 YAL_frontline_infrastructure_desc:0 "Most of our trade to Griffenheim flows along rivers, meaning the cities in our north missed out on vital investments into highways and railroads. With the Empire growing ever more volatile, it may be strategically sound to integrate the north into our existing infrastructure network."

 YAL_greenback_infrastructure:0 "Station One"
 YAL_greenback_infrastructure_desc:0 "Our rail network has been centered around Greenback since the first rails were laid down. At the centre of the city is Station One, a masterpiece of late-imperial architecture and a landmark of our capital. As the demand for train traffic grows, it will become imperative to expand this landmark with additional platforms and warehouses."

 ###Society### 
 YAL_educational_effort:0 "Modernise the Curriculum"
 YAL_educational_effort_desc:0 "The speed at which science advances is growing ever faster, leaving griffons in more unfortunate countries behind. However, the universities must keep a steady flow of students coming from the younger generations. To give them the highest chance of success, we must update the curriculum so that our pupils aren’t taught outdated theories."

 YAL_bank_reform:0 "Revise the Banking Law"
 YAL_bank_reform_desc:0 "Banking is a time-honoured tradition in all of the Herzland, but the laws that govern these bankers are opaque by design. We will have our most senior professors of law draft a new Banking Law, one that favours our country over these transnationally operating bankers. Even laissez-faire economists agree that the law should guard against perverse incentives as to make the economy more resistant to shock."

 YAL_public_schools:0 "Refurbish the Public Schools"
 YAL_public_schools_desc:0 "With most of our education budget going to universities, our public schools have been chronically underfunded. If we are to secure the flow of young talent to our universities, we must intervene. Our schools require everything, new classrooms, textbooks, and even functioning heating, so that our young ones don’t have to sit in class with two winter coats on."

 YAL_land_reform:0 "Land Consolidation"
 YAL_land_reform_desc:0 "The age of feudalism has left its mark on our country, as it has on most of Griffonia. Marriages, ancient contracts, and feuds have made the countryside a confusing patchwork of  fields owned by small farmers and big estates. By encouraging land consolidation, where farmers trade their lands to make more efficient and larger fields, our agricultural sector will surely flourish."

 YAL_agricultural_studies:0 "The Science of Agriculture"
 YAL_agricultural_studies_desc:0 "Agricultural Studies may not be the most prestigious field of science, but it is rapidly developing. Rational management theories and advances in biology and organic chemistry, along with mechanised tools have led to increasing food production across our domains."

 YAL_universal_education:0 "Universal Education"
 YAL_universal_education_desc:0 "Not every griffon has the intrinsic motivation that draws so many in Yale to the pursuit of knowledge. In fact, a lot of griffons in the countryside refuse to even send their chicks to school, preferring that they work on the land instead. Mandatory education is a necessary change, which will ensure that every talented griffon makes their way into the hallowed halls of our universities!"

 YAL_gold_standard:0 "Embrace the Gold Standard"
 YAL_gold_standard_desc:0 "When the Empire ruled Griffonia, there was no doubt about the stability of its currency. Now that the ironclad faith in Griffenheim is but a footnote in history, we require a new idea. By tying our currency to gold, our money will be stable, as no griffon will doubt the value of this most precious metal!"

 YAL_industrial_breakthrough:0 "Methods for a New Millennium"
 YAL_industrial_breakthrough_desc:0 "Our industry has lagged behind academia for a while, due to a lack of dedicated R&D investments made by our companies. If we are to move our industry into the second millennium, the state must intervene by investing in industrial modernisation. Science will allow our factories to produce more with less!"

 YAL_yale_university:0 "Expand Yale University"
 YAL_yale_university_desc:0 "Yale University is the oldest and most prestigious university in the country, but much like the city in which it resides, the institute has been overshadowed by modernity. However, its expansive libraries and tradition for excellence warrant another investment. We must commission an experienced architect to build a new wing for the old university, so that Yale may soar to new heights!"

 YAL_focused_research:0 "The Research Focus Program"
 YAL_focused_research_desc:0 "Our laboratories, scientists, and other research facilities are ready for the next step in pushing the boundaries of griffon knowledge. With the Research Focus Program, the government will set out a goal for a period of 200 days. In this time, all universities will focus their attention on tackling this particular area of study, as to produce immediate benefits for our people."

 YAL_the_great_yale_archives:0 "The Great Yale Archives"
 YAL_the_great_yale_archives_desc:0 "Borean Wiedergreiff was both an architectural visionary and a griffon working to preserve knowledge. He is responsible for many of the reforms that made Yale what it is today, but he could never see his magnum opus completed. A massive archive, housing all the world’s knowledge. The construction of this elaborate building will be a great undertaking, but a worthy project for Borean’s heirs."

 YAL_send_invitations:0 "Invite Griffonia’s Finest"
 YAL_send_invitations_desc:0 "Borean Wiedergreiff envisioned that his archives would help build peace amongst griffonkind, by becoming a meeting place for the scholarly elite and a beacon against ignorance, which in his view, led to war. With the archives complete, we must invite the best griffon scholars from every nation to study in these archives. May science lead to better understanding between Boreas’s chosen."

 YAL_learn_from_the_past:0 "The Treasures of the Past"
 YAL_learn_from_the_past_desc:0 "Warfare, ignorance, and malice destroyed much of the knowledge of the ancient Griffonian Empire. Our archives are helping historians and other researchers piece together the knowledge of the past. Much of the ancients’ knowledge may seem outdated, but sometimes they are wiser than we could ever imagine."

 ###Internal Politics###
 ##Fascism##
 YAL_gather_the_council:0 "Gather the Council"
 YAL_gather_the_council_desc:0 "With the situation in Griffenheim becoming increasingly volatile, we must gather the Council of Rectors to plan out a new course for Yale. The death of the Emperor, and the choice of a new regent, has shattered what remained of imperial unity. Desperate times call for desperate measures, so perhaps it is time to listen to some of the country’s more radical minds."
 
 YAL_bruma_and_gamia:0 "Bruma and Gamia"
 YAL_bruma_and_gamia_desc:0 "In the west of Yale lie the two university cities of Bruma and Gamia. These universities maintain close ties with the local Prelate of Arcturius and have become a breeding ground for radicalism. Gamia houses brilliant biologists, who dare to push beyond the boundaries of the ethical, while Bruma's social science faculties reject liberal theories in favour of a strong society."

 YAL_archons_patronage:0 "The Archons’ Patronage"
 YAL_archons_patronage_desc:0 "The Archons are delighted that Yale has chosen to favour the university of Bruma. To promote Bruma’s traditionalist theories to the rest of Yale, they have chosen to increase their investments into our country, increasing the church’s benign influence in our education system. With the Archons’ Patronage, our country will rise to greatness. "

 YAL_additional_funding:0 "Charitas"
 YAL_additional_funding_desc:0 "Although the role of charity in griffon society is often debated, a generous donation to public charities by the church would smooth out tensions in Yale. Many commoners question the renewed prevalence of religion in our society, but if we can show the best side of the church, their concerns will melt like dew in the sun."

 YAL_archons_visit:0 "Plan the Archon’s Visit"
 YAL_archons_visit_desc:0 "His Holiness Archon Proteus III is the embodiment of the traditional values that will save Yale from the culture-destroying ideologies of republicanism and socialism. However, some of the people still doubt the benevolent intent of Arcturius’ Archon. A visit by the Archon will remind Yale how Arcturius would want us to live."

 YAL_social_sciences:0 "Bruma’s Social Sciences"
 YAL_social_sciences_desc:0 "The university of Bruma is an exception amongst universities. Its faculty for social sciences rejects the universalist ideologies of harmony and socialism as Equestrian attempts to export their way of life. According to the professors of Bruma, if Yale is to weather the coming storm, we must return to our past and look for guidance in our own culture."

 YAL_indoctrinate_students:0 "Indoctrinate Students"
 YAL_indoctrinate_students_desc:0 "University students are interesting. They have learned so little, yet they think they understand so much. The student body of Bruma already knows their place however, working tirelessly to improve Yalian society. It is time that the student bodies of other universities follow this example."

 YAL_address_population:0 "Local Ethics"
 YAL_address_population_desc:0 "Many of our academics have grown too detached from the real world and the normal griffons. Let us return to society and learn from them. The answer to what a just society is, cannot be found in books from Equestrian philosophers. The answer is out there, in the street.All we need to do is look. "

 YAL_common_cause:0 "The Common Cause"
 YAL_common_cause_desc:0 "Now that everygriffon is in agreement with the importance of incorporating our culture into government, we can work on the task at hand. More government discretion will be needed to implement this and several rights will have to be temporarily restricted to ensure that the process proceeds smoothly."

 YAL_new_council_member:0 "A New Council Member"
 YAL_new_council_member_desc:0 "To ensure an easy advantage for Bruma and Gamia in the Council of Rectors, we will need another vote. We will have our allies in the church convince the people that the Council requires religious guidance. With this pressure, we will be able to demand for a new member; Arcturian Prelate Michael of the Yaledom."

 YAL_crackdown_on_dissenters:0 "Silence!"
 YAL_crackdown_on_dissenters_desc:0 "Many within our nation criticize the growing power of the Prelate in Yale. We cannot have these griffons organize their strength against us. We must silence these voices via the way of Arcturius the Warrior. Forcefully."

 YAL_offer_compromise:0 "Calm the Voices of Dissent"
 YAL_offer_compromise_desc:0 "The Prelate’s appointment to the Council has caused many concerns amongst student and professor alike. With compromises, flattery, and bribes, we will be able to calm the situation. Arcturius the Smith will forge our society together through strength. It is worth the effort, if every Yalian wholeheartedly supports us in the long run."
 
 YAL_challenge_griffenheim:0 "Challenge Griffenheim!"
 YAL_challenge_griffenheim_desc:0 "The foolish Griffenheim nobility have forced out the Archon of Boreas. Without him as regent, who knows what corruption these nobles may force into the head of Grover VI. It is time to restore the church before Griffenheim unleashes disaster upon us all. Arcturius smiles upon the faithful who take up arms in his name. With the Prelate’s blessing, we go to war!"

 YAL_stabilize_council:0 "Yale’s New Position"
 YAL_stabilize_council_desc:0 "Archon Eros VII has rightfully been appointed regent of the Empire, with Archon Proteus III part of his ruling council. With them leading the faithful, a new era is sure to follow. The Prelate believes that we will be better off by keeping a semblance of autonomy in the greater Griffonian Empire and the Archons will surely agree with his views."

 YAL_cooperation_offer:0 "Into the Fold"
 YAL_cooperation_offer_desc:0 "Archon Eros VII has been appointed regent of his Imperial Majesty Grover VI, with Archon Proteus III part of his ruling council. Our citizens clamour to rejoin the Empire and enjoy the benefits of the Archons’ guidance. Who are we to deny the people their birthright of Imperial citizenship?"

 YAL_biological_sciences:0 "The Science of Life"
 YAL_biological_sciences_desc:0 "Gamia is known for its biology department. While most universities have codes of conduct that restrict their attempts to conduct experiments on the living, this university is dedicated to a pure form of knowledge acquisition."

 YAL_initiate_research:0 "Unlimited Potential"
 YAL_initiate_research_desc:0 "With Yale quickly turning away from conventional ethics, there is an opportunity to remove the last obstacles to scientific progress. By altering guidelines and regulations that restrict unlimited experimentation, our full potential will finally be discovered."

 YAL_griffon_biology:0 "Griffon Biology"
 YAL_griffon_biology_desc:0 "We must begin our research at the core. The griffon body. A unique blend of several different species of animals, it is clear that the griffon has adapted to a level of complexity beyond anything else on this planet. Some griffons even have some potential for certain types of magic, further proving our superiority."

 YAL_encourage_student_research:0 "Encourage Student Research"
 YAL_encourage_student_research_desc:0 "The students, especially the younger ones, are still a bit weary of going along with our methods. However, there is much potential in Gamia and we must encourage these griffons to let go of any ‘morality’ they adopted outside these walls. Progress is the ultimate goal."

 YAL_delve_deeper:0 "Delve Deeper"
 YAL_delve_deeper_desc:0 "Our research is expanding our fields of vision and the future is becoming ever clearer. The griffon body, and its energy, divine essence, life itself. These are not, should not, be the domains of just the Gods. Understanding and manipulating these essential concepts is within our reach."

 YAL_project_auferstehung:0 "Project Auferstehung"
 YAL_project_auferstehung_desc:0 "Life, as it is commonly understood, has a definitive end. However, science may yet pierce the veil that separates the living from the dead and retrieve a soul lost to our world. Imagine the implications!"

 YAL_project_weihe:0 "Project Weihe"
 YAL_project_weihe_desc:0 "Objectively, the Gods hold the most knowledge of the world and therefore, their instructions should be followed. However, the great distance between us and the heavens has made their word unclear and up to interpretation. What if we could retrieve this information directly from the source?"

 YAL_project_wohlstand:0 "Project Wohlstand"
 YAL_project_wohlstand_desc:0 "The world is run by a very complex system of trade, prices, and economic laws. But the griffon mind was never constructed to properly take advantage of these systems, as the inferior understanding of our colleagues in Middenheim demonstrates perfectly. Altering the mind is not beyond our ability, however ."


###Non-Alligned###
 YAL_central_universities:0 "The Central Universities"
 YAL_central_universities_desc:0 "The universities of Greenback, Greengate, and Middenheim all have different specialties, but their leadership shares a similar vision. Ultimately, the goal of science is to serve society. Whether it is with new medicine, new technology, or by increasing prosperity, we will work for a better future!"

 YAL_greengate_engineering:0 "Greengate University"
 YAL_greengate_engineering_desc:0 "The foremost engineers, both electronic and mechanical, have made Greengate their favoured university. The university is close to Greenback, the industrial beating heart of the country. The engineers of Greengate are eager to receive more funding, promising quick returns in technical advancements!"

 YAL_radar_research:0 "Project Sentinel"
 YAL_radar_research_desc:0 "For some time, Greengate’s engineers have dreamt of developing our own RADAR system. Not only will such an array provide us with invaluable scientific data, the listening post would help us keep an eye on our neighbours and spot incoming aircraft. Of course, there is a price tag involved."

 YAL_better_air_detection:0 "Watch Everything"
 YAL_better_air_detection_desc:0 "Project Sentinel is a resounding success and the data is flowing in. However, our scientists hunger for even more data to crunch, while our military command is eager to further spy on our rivals’ movements. Additional funding could improve our Sentinel stations even more!"

 YAL_industrial_engineering:0 "The Machine Spirit"
 YAL_industrial_engineering_desc:0 "A group of very dedicated engineers have begun wearing robes in our university and are weirdly obsessed with prosthetics. They are really knowledgeable, but may care a bit too much about their prized machinery. Their innovations may serve us well, but let’s leave them alone with their machine spirit."

 YAL_synthetic_research:0 "Transmuting the Black Gold"
 YAL_synthetic_research_desc:0 "Greengate University’s heritage goes all the way back to that of griffon alchemists. These proto-scientists diligently worked to use magic and science to make lead into gold. Of course, without modern techniques, their efforts were doomed to fail. But some of our engineers are insisting that we give it another try!"

 YAL_form_computer_faculty:0 "Found the Computing Faculty"
 YAL_form_computer_faculty_desc:0 "Mathematics is the foundation of all science. In fact, it is the frame through which we understand the fundamental processes of our world. Visionaries have already dreamt of Automatic Computers, but with electronics and mechanics combined, our new Computing Faculty will lead the way into the future!"

 YAL_encryption_decryption:0 "The Wingaarden Theorem"
 YAL_encryption_decryption_desc:0 "Adriaan van Wingaarden, a Feathisian mechanical engineer, is making amazing breakthroughs in the field of computer technology! We should follow his ideas closely and make sure that our Computing Faculty stays up to date in this new and boundless field of innovation!"

 YAL_pioneers_in_engineering:0 "Pioneers in Engineering"
 YAL_pioneers_in_engineering_desc:0 "Greengate University has become a campus full of exciting possibilities! The experiments and theories conducted here seem way beyond the possible. The machines built will revolutionise modern life, when they become available for the public. These pioneers are paving the way towards a better tomorrow!"

 YAL_health_sciences:0 "Greenback’s Academy of Medicine"
 YAL_health_sciences_desc:0 "Yale’s largest city is also one of many problems. Hard work in the factories, pollution, and poverty all harm many griffons. The Greenback Academy of Medicine has done miracles to advance the medical sciences. With substantial support, cures that seem decades away can be achieved within reasonable time!"

 YAL_greenback_hospital:0 "Greenback University Hospital"
 YAL_greenback_hospital_desc:0 "Close to the University of Greenback stands the biggest hospital in Yale, where thousands are being treated simultaneously. It is also the training ground for many doctors and a place where, through trial and error, science advances slowly. Some refurbishments, extra staff, and a new wing are sorely needed to keep our healthcare in order."

 YAL_modernised_medical_procedures:0 "Modernised Medical Procedures"
 YAL_modernised_medical_procedures_desc:0 "The lessons from Greenback will have to be rolled out across the country, if we are to keep our entire population healthy. Every death is a tragedy and with the latest medical technology, we hope that all hospitals can work to keep more griffons alive."

 YAL_pharmacology:0 "Pharmacology"
 YAL_pharmacology_desc:0 "The study of the practical application of medicine is an up and coming branch of science. Most academics spend too much time in laboratories, crafting up theories and doing controlled tests. Let us focus on how medicine works in the real world, as better medicines will benefit both the people and the army."

 YAL_enhancement_drugs:0 "Combat Stimulants"
 YAL_enhancement_drugs_desc:0 "Our soldiers are subject to all sort of hardships. The griffon body already has a lot of ways to deal with them, such as adrenaline. However, to give our soldiers a better chance, we can increase their combat effectiveness and perhaps make life on the front easier. Plus, we do not have conclusive data to support that these drugs have any negative side-effects."

 YAL_magical_potential:0 "Magical Potential"
 YAL_magical_potential_desc:0 "The griffon body is vastly different from that of a unicorn or  changeling, but we are still able to perform acts that could be classified as magical. We must research what makes a griffon magical. How can we alter and increase this? Is magic something immaterial, or is there an organ responsible for this? Who knows what we will find after a little research? "

 YAL_unravel_the_mind:0 "Unravel the Mind"
 YAL_unravel_the_mind_desc:0 "The brain sits mightily atop the body, controlling every movement and processing every piece of information it receives.How curious that we now contemplate the contemplator. How do we think? What did the Gods give us that makes us conscious of our own existence? Is it possible to find out? We must know!"

 YAL_understand_the_body:0 "Understand the Body"
 YAL_understand_the_body_desc:0 "The body houses our soul and mind, but is the most curious part of this trio. Its complexity and harmony seem to always reveal new depths. It is clear that with each step we take towards understanding our basic physical characteristics, more questions reveal themselves. But knowledge is the reward of the faithful searcher. Knowledge that could save lives. "

 YAL_promise_of_health:0 "The Oath of the Physician"
 YAL_promise_of_health_desc:0 "“I will use treatment to help the sick according to my ability, but never with a view to injury. Into each house I enter, I will enter to help the sick, and I will abstain from all intentional wrongdoing. And what I shall see or hear in the course of my profession, I will hold to be holy secrets. If I carry out this oath, may I gain reputation among all griffons for my art; but if I break it, may the opposite befall me.”"

 YAL_middenheim_business_university:0 "Middenheim School of Economics"
 YAL_middenheim_business_university_desc:0 "With ever more goods being produced and international trade linking the world more closely, the study of economics has received increased attention. Middenheim, Yale’s leading centre of economists, rejects the theories of communists, choosing to improve capitalist system instead."

 YAL_art_of_negotiation:0 "The Art of Negotiation"
 YAL_art_of_negotiation_desc:0 "“The worst thing you can do in a negotiation is seem desperate to make it. That makes the other bird smell blood, and then you're dead. Leverage is the biggest strength you can have. Leverage is having something the other griffon wants.  Or better yet, simply can't do without. Unfortunately, that isn't always the case, which is why leverage often requires imagination and salesgriffship.”"

 YAL_stock_investiture:0 "National Stock Effort"
 YAL_stock_investiture_desc:0 "For the stock market to be of the greatest benefit to the economy, shareholders should have a long term vision. By increasing the state’s share of our most important firms and encouraging investors to keep their stocks for longer terms, our nation will reap the benefits. "

 YAL_clawnes:0 "Lord Meynard Clawnes"
 YAL_clawnes_desc:0 "The economy is a circular flow of money, and spending is the crux to prosperity. A lack of confidence in the economy stops consumption, creating depression. To increase the flow of capital, states can keep spending to kickstart the economy. Even war spending will create jobs!"

 YAL_government_oversight:0 "Government Oversight"
 YAL_government_oversight_desc:0 "The market is fickle and prone to failure, like a car engine in need of tuning. We must give the government more discretion to intervene, balancing public and private interests. Using equations and models, we can determine where money is needed to get the highest growth."

 YAL_state_investments_industry:0 "Boost Aggregate Demand"
 YAL_state_investments_industry_desc:0 "It is indeed demand that determines the strength of the economy. The state can boost demand by embarking on public works projects. The money spent on these works will multiply as it circulates in the economy and gets used by workers to buy other products."

 YAL_steer_the_market:0 "Steer the Market"
 YAL_steer_the_market_desc:0 "The Yalian economy must focus on boosting demand and spending in the economy. Money trapped in the bank accounts of greedy griffons cannot help grow the economy, and the more money trapped, the harder economic growth will become. Let us keep spending and proclaim “We’re all Clawnesians now!”"

 YAL_hawk:0 "August von Hawk"
 YAL_hawk_desc:0 "The economy is not simply put into one equation, but is the culmination of the actions and motivations of all beings. Only real savings and real advancement can grow the economy, not an increase of available money. Bailouts, state investments and other such matters distort the market, creating bubbles and keeping losers on top. It is time to get sober and start saving."

 YAL_self_regulated_companies:0 "Self-Regulation"
 YAL_self_regulated_companies_desc:0 "Companies go after their own interest, but only the biggest companies have the power to influence our government directly, distorting the market with rules that benefit them. The only real way to make markets work, is if the state retreats from the arena, so that the market can get the prices right."

 YAL_small_business_encouragement:0 "Small Businesses Competes"
 YAL_small_business_encouragement_desc:0 "Hawk’s model has been accused of favouring big business, but this is not the case. Some industries have massive barriers to entry, almost naturally creating little competition. In this case, we can intervene by allowing small businesses the chance to compete with big firms."

 YAL_free_the_market:0 "Free the Market"
 YAL_free_the_market_desc:0 "We must set the market free. No longer will stimulus and bailouts give perverse incentives. We will balance the books, save money, and slowly grow the economy. We will not hold illusions about easy ways to increase production. Hard work, real ingenuity, and a trust in our griffons to help each other, will make Yale flourish."

 YAL_economic_prosperity:0 "A Future of Prosperity"
 YAL_economic_prosperity_desc:0 "Whatever path chosen, the economists of Middenheim work tirelessly to update their models and craft the best strategies with which we can face the future. Prosperity has emerged in the country by virtue of a careful economic policy, not one determined by the whims of politicians or mobs. The future is bright for everygriffon!"

 ###Communism###
 YAL_cyrusval_university:0 "Cyrusval University"
 YAL_cyrusval_university_desc:0 "Cyrusval University mainly teaches the social sciences, but unlike Bruma, their campus has become a hotbed for revolutionaries. A spirit of hopeful energy is prevalent around the old university grounds as professors preach radical new ideas to young minds from Yale and beyond. It may be dangerous, but perhaps this energy is just what this country needs."

 YAL_the_student_vanguard:0 "Rally the Student Vanguard"
 YAL_the_student_vanguard_desc:0 "It is the duty of those enlightened by the revolutionary spirit, to spread the truth about class struggle and capitalist oppression. The students of Cyrusval must lead the charge to a better future, so that we may see a classless utopia in our lifetime!"

 YAL_the_faculty:0 "The Faculty"
 YAL_the_faculty_desc:0 "The Faculty of Social Sciences is well aware of the plight of the working class in most of Griffonia, along with previous attempts at revolution. With increased funding from the central government, the Faculty will be able to develop a social policy that will make Yale strong in these turbulent times. In secret, the Faculty seeks to undermine the government’s legitimacy, preparing the stage for revolution."

 YAL_to_the_barricades:0 "To the Barricades!"
 YAL_to_the_barricades_desc:0 "The writings of the Faculty have eroded the legitimacy of Yale’s government, while the Student Vanguard has made the people aware of their plight.

 YAL_mobile_warfare_desc:0 "Staffed by professors who served as attachés to Griffenheim and the Changeling Empire, the School of Experimental Warfare has quickly come to dominate Kama Academy. This department has heavily promoted theories of combined arms warfare, hoping to replicate the success of the Changeling army in becoming an efficient fighting force."

 YAL_superior_firepower:0 "School of Artillery and Engineering"
 YAL_superior_firepower_desc:0 "The School of Artillery and Engineering is the academy’s oldest faculty. While they’ve experienced a decline in recent years, they still hold considerable sway within campus politics. While they appreciate the effectiveness of armoured vehicles, they favour them in a supporting role alongside traditional infantry formations, backed by big guns and overwhelming firepower."

 YAL_fight_fire_with_fire:0 "Developing the Guns"
 YAL_fight_fire_with_fire_desc:0 "Our existing artillery is poorly equipped for dealing with armoured vehicles, employing high explosive shells with little armour penetrating potential. Our eventual tanks will require a new type of cannon and shell, focusing more of velocity and armour penetration. The best part, these cannons can be used independent of armour until we’ve finished development on a tank chassis."

 YAL_improved_barrel_designs:0 "Modern Infantry"
 YAL_improved_barrel_designs_desc:0 "In mechanized warfare, infantry still has an important role to play. While armour is meant to slice through hostile lines, and isolate defending units, infantry is still necessary when dealing with these pockets or heavily defended strongpoints. As such, we should focus on training and equipping our infantry in a manner which allows them to more efficiently accomplish this task."

 YAL_improved_tank_designs:0 "Developing the Tank"
 YAL_improved_tank_designs_desc:0 "Investments into the development of new guns, armaments, engines, and armour have finally allowed us a chance to design and begin work on our very first tanks. With these, we can begin to put our meticulously crafted doctrine into practice, giving us some much-needed experience with combined arms warfare."

 YAL_stick_with_the_doctrine:0 "Kama War Games"
 YAL_stick_with_the_doctrine_desc:0 "Kama Academy has taken advantage of Yale’s rolling plains, using them to conduct an intricate war game to test out the feasibility of combined arms doctrine. While these wargames will use very little actual tanks, instead opting for crudely armoured tractors, they will provide valuable insight into the tactics and logistics of motorized armies."

 YAL_organized_blitzkrieg:0 "Armoured Research Grant"
 YAL_organized_blitzkrieg_desc:0 "The Rectors are very impressed by the progress of Kama Academy, awarding the institute a highly lucrative research grant.

 YAL_new_tank_models:0 "Lessons from Griffenheim"
 YAL_new_tank_models_desc:0 "Griffenheim rocked Griffonia when they announced the creation of the continent’s first armoured division. At the time, experts from Kama were attached to this unit and given valuable insight on how tanks were developed, mustered, and used in training. It’s hoped that these experts will be able to replicate these designs and implement them effectively into the Yale Security Force."

 YAL_infantry_mechanisation:0 "The Grifftruck"
 YAL_infantry_mechanisation_desc:0 "The Grifftruck is a staple of the Griffonian Empire, being used from Feathisia to Bronzehill and from the Strawberry Duchy down to Yale. It is cheap, rugged, and easy to produce, being suited for the empire’s rough terrain and poor infrastructure. This vehicle would be the perfect addition to our armed forces, allowing us to rapidly move our troops into combat."

 YAL_heavier_tanks:0 "Lessons from the Changeling Empire"
 YAL_heavier_tanks_desc:0 "The Changeling Empire is the forefathers of armoured warfare, developing much of the doctrine and norms that have become associated with it. For a while, attaches from Kama were given a chance to work with the Changelings, giving us a look at tank designs decades ahead of Griffonia. By replicating these designs, we would no doubt gain a decisive edge over our opponents."

 YAL_armour_power:0 "Kama School of Armoured Design"
 YAL_armour_power_desc:0 "The Kama School of Armoured Design was created in order to pool together the greatest engineering minds in Yale. Their duty is to look at developments in armoured design, both foreign and domestic, and implement them into future tanks in order to ensure that we have the fastest, strongest, and most well armed tanks in Griffonia."

 YAL_new_guns:0 "Updating the Service Rifle"
 YAL_new_guns_desc:0 "The backbone of an effective infantry formation is the rifle which every solider carries. However, the standard issue rifle of Yale is severely out of date with many of the troops in our security forces still using black powder muskets. In order to address this, the Council of Rectors has awarded Kama with a generous grant to modernize Yale’s service rifle."

 YAL_modern_artillery:0 "Reinvigorating the Artillery Corp"
 YAL_modern_artillery_desc:0 "When the School of Artillery and Engineering first formed, its officers were trained on muzzle loaded cannons. Yet, decades later little innovation has been made beyond this, causing the school to lag behind modern developments in design and doctrine. In order to address this, we must secure more modern armaments and properly supply the school with equipment and experts."

 YAL_battlefield_support:0 "Reinvigorating the Engineering Corp"
 YAL_battlefield_support_desc:0 "The Engineering Corp of the School of Artillery and Engineering has always played second fiddle in the department, receiving less funding, resources, and poorer quality staff. However, developments in modern warfare have shown the importance of engineers in combat roles, forcing us to re-evaluate the importance of the Engineering Corp within campus politics."

 YAL_protect_the_skies:0 "Diversify Artillery"
 YAL_protect_the_skies_desc:0 "Recent innovations in aircraft design have given them an important role in combat, with the ability to harass or even decimate units from the sky. The poor industrial base of Yale has forced us to seek an alternative means of dealing with this threat. Kama has come to the rescue, proposing that artillery guns be retrofitted with a higher velocities, allowing them to shoot explosive shells into the sky."

 YAL_blazing_guns:0 "Artillery Research Grant"
 YAL_blazing_guns_desc:0 "The Rectors are very impressed by the progress shown by Kama Academy, awarding the institute a highly lucrative research grant.

 YAL_stand_against_our_enemies:0 "The Council's First Dictate"
 YAL_stand_against_our_enemies_desc:0 "Yale has always been a pacifist nation, rarely using its security force for anything more than border security and disaster relief. However, as the prospects of war look likely, the Defense Council has implemented its first dictate. In it, the council put in place plans to acquire modern military equipment, increase the size of the armed forces, and begin construction on new fortifications."

 YAL_tuition_for_service:0 "The Cadet Charter"
 YAL_tuition_for_service_desc:0 "Yale suffers from a lack of recruits for its Security Force. This is due to the majority of the military age population seeking an education from one of the nation’s universities, gaining a deferment from service. In an effort to elevate this issue, the Rectors have passed the Cadet Charter which offers financial assistant to those who serve in the Security Force to use towards their future education."

 YAL_magic_infused_equipment:0 "Finance Crystal Research"
 YAL_magic_infused_equipment_desc:0 "Within recent years, there has been a growing attention given towards crystals within academia. This is due to evidence pointing towards them being an especially dense and potent source of energy, with the ability to produce more joules per kilogram than coal or oil. However, Yale has largely ignored this field of study, a mistake which must immediately be corrected."

 YAL_support_companies:0 "Modernizing our Battalions"
 YAL_support_companies_desc:0 "The growing complexity of weapons, tactics, and warfare has created a demand for niche combat roles to support our units in combat. These include engineers for besieging entrenched positions, radiococks to coordinate units, and logistics specialists to organize the supplies necessary to keep a unit combat effect. In order to stay at the front of innovation, we must explore these organizational systems."

 YAL_racial_advantages:0 "Cooperate with Gamia"
 YAL_racial_advantages_desc:0 "Griffons are truly fearsome creatures with bodies that tower over their pony foes and claws which can shred even the hardiest of opponents.

 YAL_modernize_the_knights:0 "11th Century Knights"
 YAL_modernize_the_knights_desc:0 "While many of our neighbours have capitalized upon the usage of knights, our nation has never seen the benefit of training and equipping such elite warriors. However, as conflict creeps ever closer, many within the Council of Rectors are calling for the establishment of a Knight Corp within Yale, trained and equipped in a manner befitting modern special forces."

 YAL_brains_of_the_battlefield:0 "Yale Chiefs of Staff"
 YAL_brains_of_the_battlefield_desc:0 "The Defense Council has served its purpose well, properly guiding the Yale Security Force from humble roots to a truly modern combat force.

 YAL_expand_ammunition_production:0 "Standardize our Service Rifle"
 YAL_expand_ammunition_production_desc:0 "Currently, battalions of the Yale Security Force are sponsored by the nation’s universities. These campuses are each responsible for the equipping of their units, meaning that two campuses can contract drastically different arms manufacturers, creating a logistical nightmare. In an effort to address this, the Defense Council has drafted a short list of approved manufacturers."

 YAL_extend_military_service:0 "Militarize the Clubs"
 YAL_extend_military_service_desc:0 "Canterberley Academy, along with other universities, host a number of clubs and organizations, which the student body is encouraged to join.

 YAL_sharing_is_caring:0 "Redifining Doctrine"
 YAL_sharing_is_caring_desc:0 "Previously, Canterberley’s doctrine for surrounded unit focused on attempting a breakout and linking back up with the frontline. In the event this failed, a surrender was to be made in order to preserve life in the face of defeat. However, the Red Guard criticizes this philosophy, believing that surrounded units can still fulfil a very important role of tying down enemy battalions."

 YAL_wave_tactics:0 "Conscript the Unions"
 YAL_wave_tactics_desc:0 "Universities runs on more than just academics. There is a whole support network of janitors, chefs, mechanics, groundskeepers, and various other jobs which are necessary to keep the campus running. All of these support staff are mandated to join a campus union which looks after their collective interests. With conflict on the horizon, union members will now be liable for conscription."

 YAL_infantry_first:0 "Revolutionizing Doctrine"
 YAL_infantry_first_desc:0 "The concept of mass assault is hard to swallow. It calls for what is in essentially griffon wave tactics, throwing walls of young cocks and hens into the meat grinder that is combat.

 YAL_base_strike_f:0 "The Equestrian Model"
 YAL_base_strike_f_desc:0 "When it come to naval dominance, no navy controls the seas quite like the Equestrians. Their navy is centred upon aircraft carriers, which combine air and naval power to maximize their projection of force over vast geographic areas. By hiring Equestrian military advisors, we can begin to train our future sailors on Equestrian doctrine."

 YAL_carrier_f:0 "Retrofit Incomplete Capital Ships"
 YAL_carrier_f_desc:0 "Griffonia is a land of many optimistic governments with lofty naval ambitions. However, for every battleship that sets sail, another three languish in ports, in a perpetual state of incompletion. By buying these incomplete ships, we can convert them into our first aircraft carriers."

 YAL_navy_planes_f:0 "Reinventing the Airplane"
 YAL_navy_planes_f_desc:0 "Aircraft carriers pose an interesting challenge. Their shorter runways mean that the planes operating from them need to be lighter, while limited hanger space requires a more compact design. However, we are Yale, and challenges simply mean a new opportunity to innovate, adapt, and design."

 YAL_fleet_being_f:0 "The Feathisian Model"
 YAL_fleet_being_f_desc:0 "Feathisia is the only member of the Empire to have a navy, with a battlecruiser acting as the nucleus which holds their small fleet together.

 YAL_battlecruiser_f_desc:0 "The Negen Provincien stands as the pride of both the Feathesian Navy and the de facto Imperial Kriegsmarine. While the ship’s design is a closely guarded secret, we can hopefully convince our brothers to help us in taking the first steps in naval development."

 YAL_light_cruiser_f:0 "Sponsor Domestic Ship Building"
 YAL_light_cruiser_f_desc:0 "While the realm of ship building has been nothing but a fantasy, until recently, it hasn’t stopped our engineers from drafting blueprints and coming up with designs for all manner of ships. While most are too lofty for current technology and industrial capabilities, a singular light cruiser design has proven feasible for our Rectorate to put into action."

 YAL_battleship_f:0 "Knowledge, Learning, and Understanding"
 YAL_battleship_f_desc:0 "Our recent naval build-up has created a need for even larger ships in order to further secure our interests abroad. The Rectorate has seen that a series of three battleships be commissioned in the coming years. These will be known as the Knowledge, the Learning, and the Understanding, and each will bear armour and weaponry that is unmatched."

 YAL_expand_dockyards:0 "Further Encroach upon the Civilian Economy"
 YAL_expand_dockyards_desc:0 "Our seizure of civilian dockyards did wonders in kickstarting production of our warships. However, our appetite for these crucial industrial assets has not been sated. We must further encroach upon the civilian naval infrastructure and seize even more dockyards."

 YAL_marine_f_desc:0 "The Yale Coastal Defense Force has been requesting their own infantry units for quite some time, claiming that the regular Security Force does a poor job of training their recruits on the realities of naval invasions. They hope that this new branch will form an elite combat force which will be utilized for raiding hostile coast lines."

 YAL_transport_f:0 "Armoured Landing Craft"
 YAL_transport_f_desc:0 "If we were even pushed to launch a naval raid, our infantry would be put in a highly precarious situation. Current doctrine is sparse on the subject and our existing landing craft are little more than fishing skiffs. In order to modernize our forces, we must invest into upgrading both our landing craft and the doctrine behind them."

 YAL_trade_indirection_f:0 "The Yale Model"
 YAL_trade_indirection_f_desc:0 "Our experience at the seas is minimal, putting us at a severe disadvantage against the more established navies of the world. When paired with our weak industrial capabilities, it might be wise to invest in a small navy of light ships which lowers the chances of wasted investment while we endure this learning phase."

 YAL_destroyer_f:0 "An Experiment"
 YAL_destroyer_f_desc:0 "Before we can plunge fully into the world of naval warfare, we must first construct a testing platform in order to test new weapons, combat systems, and electronics. While designed for testing purposes, these light ships could also make effective destroyers in a pinch."

 YAL_doctrinal_development:0 "Offensive vs Defensive Air Force"
 YAL_doctrinal_development_desc:0 "The Yale Defense Council is currently split on the role of our air force in future conflicts. One group of experts are claiming that an air force should be used to strike at enemy formations, disrupting them before they threaten us. Another group claims that the focus of an air force should be to defend our industrial assets from aerial attack."

 YAL_actual_air_bases_desc:0 "Greenback International Airport is one of the busiest in Griffonia, servicing close to half a million passengers annual. In order to accommodate this increased demand, the airport authority has requests grants to constructs a second runway, increasing the speed by which planes can take off and land."

 YAL_strat:0 "A Messy Affair"
 YAL_strat_desc:0 "There is nothing clean and glorious about the horrors of modern war. As the progress of industrialization continues, cities and the civilian populace become another figure to factor into when calculating the strength of a nation. While Yale has no intention of delving to these lowest of the lows, we must still be prepared to strike at this military asset when the time comes."

 YAL_tact:0 "A Versatile Aircraft"
 YAL_tact_desc:0 "Bombs fill many important roles in the doctrine of modern war. They can be used against enemy strongpoints, used to disrupt hostile formations and infrastructure, or used to knock out the enemy’s industrial capabilities. It is important that we design a bomber which can perform all of these roles effectively."

 YAL_napalm:0 "Greengate’s Contribution"
 YAL_napalm_desc:0 "The chemists at Greengate have discovered a new chemical which will forever revolutionize war. It is likened to a petroleum-based jelly which is known to burn hot and for long periods of time.

 YAL_CAS_projects:0 "AirLand Battle"
 YAL_CAS_projects_desc:0 "In the event of war, it will become vital for our air force to possess the means of assaulting hostile formations. By employing light attack aircraft, we can ensure a maneuverable and highly accurate means of assaulting the enemy."

 YAL_heavy_fighter_projects:0 "A Griffonian Fighter"
 YAL_heavy_fighter_projects_desc:0 "Griffonia is a vast continent and traditional aircraft can only hope to cover a few hundred kilometers of it. In order to address this, we must design larger aircraft which can operate over much larger distances."

 YAL_rocket_projects:0 "100 Kilometers"
 YAL_rocket_projects_desc:0 "It seems like such a small distance, barely shorter than that between Greenback and Yale. Yet, if one were to head straight up, this minor jaunt would be the difference between Eques and space. A hundred kilometers is all that separates us from the stars and the engineers and scientists of Yale want to be the first to break this barrier."

 YAL_paratrooper_project:0 "Generic Paratrooper Focus"

 YAL_expanded_bases:0 "Upgrade Regional Airports"
 YAL_expanded_bases_desc:0 "While Greenback International has prospered in recent years, the dozen or so regional airports throughout Yale have remained relatively stagnant. Eight of them are missing terminals, six are missing air traffic control towers, and five don’t even have a paved runway. These issues must be solved in order to ensure the dominance of Greenback Air."

 YAL_jet_fighters:0 "The Sound Barrier"
 YAL_jet_fighters_desc:0 "Can a griffon go faster than the speed of sound? Scientists and engineers have been asking this question for close to a decade, watching as advances in aircraft bring us ever closer to this dream. However, with the advent of the jet engine it seems like this lofty goal might finally be within our reach."

 yale.1.t:0 "Project Delays"
 yale.1.d:0 "Things have been rough at the Great Archives’ construction site. Deliveries of supplies not arriving on time, unusually bad weather, and plain bad luck have come together and caused serious delays. No griffon in particular is to blame, but the project will take significantly longer now."
 yale.1.a:0 "Recalculate the timetables. Again."
 
 yale.2.t:0 "Demand for more Funding"
 yale.2.d:0 "“What do you mean, you forgot to put a zero behind that price? You incompetent son of a pony!”\n\nThe head administrator of the Archives’ project raged uncontrollably at one of his clerks. Of course, the poor griffon could not magically summon a sack of gold, so there was little use. The fact remained. The project had gone way over its already ridiculously high budget. He had to ask the government to increase funding again, or risk further delays."
 yale.2.a:0 "Increase funding!"
 yale.2.b:0 "Not a penny more."

 yale.3.t:0 "Precious Materials Lost"
 yale.3.d:0 "The marble used for the statues and pillars of the Archives comes from all over Griffonia, and sadly, even transport for such a noble project isn’t always safe from the many dangers and nuisances that cloud Boreas’s realm. Several transports of marble, and other valuable materials, have been lost to banditry or held up due to red tape at one of the many border crossings. The problem has become so profound that some of our artists and construction workers lack the materials to continue construction on schedule. We will have to take additional time before the Archives can be opened."
 yale.3.a:0 "If only we griffons could cooperate for the common good."
  
 yale.4.t:0 "A Touch of Genius, A Hint of Madness"
 yale.4.d:0 "The designs left by the great visionary, Borean Wiedergreiff, are both ingenious and cryptic. It is clear that the architect-scholar had accounted for many of the problems we now face, but sometimes it is hard to decipher the griffon’s notoriously bad handwriting and ambiguous use of terms.\n\nHowever, with careful study, the architects have managed to decipher a key part of the building plans, which would drastically decrease the needed strength for the Archives’ support structure. The project carries on, with significant savings in both material and time."
 yale.4.a:0 "He truly thought of everything."
 
 yale.5.t:0 "To Err on the Side of Caution"
 yale.5.d:0 "Although construction projects are notoriously optimistic, when it comes to their projections of the cost and timetables, it seems that for once, the foregriffs and architects have been too cautious. Work has been going smoothly, helped by good weather and a lack of sick absentees. We can confidently shave some weeks off the construction time."
 yale.5.a:0 "Let us not waste our good fortunes."
 
 yale.6.t:0 "A Most Welcome Donation"
 yale.6.d:0 "A well-known historian, once a student of the famous Borean Wiedergreiff, has given a donation to the construction effort. Although the donation includes some much needed funds, the real treasure is a bundle of texts from the master himself, describing his architectural visions, along with some unique sketches and plans for the Archives. With another perspective on the project, we may be able to increase our construction speed substantially!"
 yale.6.a:0 "Great news!"

 yale.7.t:0 "Opening of the Yalian Archives"
 yale.7.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]After years of hard work, [YAL.GetNameDef] has completed one of the largest building projects in griffon history, the Great Yale Archives. This building, originally thought up by Borean Wiedergreiff, the first scholar-ruler of Yale, has been a dream of many in Yale. The building is an enormous spire, accessible from many floors by the flying griffons. In it are floor upon floor of books, manuscripts and artefacts carefully collected by [YAL.GetAdjective] scientists. Now that the building is complete, this repository of all griffon knowledge will be used to further progress for all griffons. Analysts expect [YAL.GetName] to carefully choose who gains access to the marvellous archives, to influence griffonia for the better."

 yale.8.t:0 "Aura Boreae"
 yale.8.d:0 "The question of the gods’, and more specifically of Boreas’, true nature had been fascinating the scholars of Yale for quite some time. Now, with the most modern techniques, and a scientific curiosity some more conservative griffons would call unholy, the Yale observatory was ready to pierce into the Heavenly Domain of the Gods.\n\nTheologists, astronomers and physicists collaborated in ‘Project Weihe’, pinpointing the supposed location of Boreas in the night sky, while the most talented engineers prepared the technical instruments which would open a path into the heavens.\n\nAnd on one fateful night, the project was set, and both audio and visual data was coming in from the intricate machinery set up in the university. First nothing, but when the griffons looked close enough, something materialised before their very eyes. Someone, in fact! An intelligent looking, stern, pale, featherless griffon looked at them. His beak seemed distorted in the image, but there was no doubt that this was the face of Boreas. The researchers became ever more excited, they had definitively proven the existence of God! Amidst the excited chatter of self-important scientists congratulating each other, the audio instruments picked up a message: In old Imperial script he proclaimed: "T Genus Emptio."\n\nThis instruction confused the scholars and the theologists present could not place this divine command in any context. When the scholars tried to re-establish contact with Boreas later, the image never reappeared, nor were there anymore messages from the heavens. Perhaps it was better if the world didn’t learn about Boreas’s true message. . . "

 yale.12.t:0 "A Letter from the Past"
 yale.12.d:0 "Today, a strange envelope arrived in the mailbox of the Rector Magnificus. It was odd, as it contained the seal of that very same office. When his aide handed him the curious letter, it became clear that it came from before their lifetimes…\n\n“To the recipient of this letter,\n\nThis letter is meant as both congratulations and gratitude for your services to the good of griffonkind. So, if you would indulge me, I would like to address a few words to you. In my lifetime, which has undoubtedly passed, many amazing discoveries have been made, for good and ill, out of lust for wealth and power, or for fear of the power of others. I hope you find yourself in more enlightened times than I do, but I fear that not much has changed in our basic mentality. I do hope my preparations for Yale have been of some aid to your efforts to break this cycle and use science to pursue peace.\n\nPerhaps, if I was lucky, you were taught in university that all scientists stand on the shoulders of those who came before and I would be most humbled if I were amongst those giants. However, this is not the entire truth. We stand on the shoulders of all beings, who in their labours provide the circumstances for us to move forwards. Scientific progress is not owed to scientists, but to the people that enable scientists to do their research. Thus, from this concludes that it is all of society that deserves the fruits of scientific progress.\n\nThis truth may seem self-evident, but if your journey as a leader has been the same as mine, you must have had many doubts. You could have let doubts about security and the things you hold dear get in the way of using the unique position you were given for the good of those who entrusted it to you. I sincerely thank you for having not given in to those desires even in your darkest hour and the hope of your people must be that you remain this strong.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJust one being, Borean Wiedergreiff.”\n\nThe Rector stared at the paper for a while, before smiling. The enigmatic founder of Yale always had one last surprise, this one heart-warming. The griffon’s final wish did indeed come to pass."
 yale.12.a:0 "We have chosen the right path."

 yale.13.t:0 "The Union Question"
 yale.13.d:0 "The new rector of Cyrusval university, Erich Mühschabel looked over the dimly lit A-12 lecture hall in Cyrusval University. This was the first meeting of the revolutionaries since they had taken control of the Academic Council under the guise of securing social welfare. After this first success, the seats were filled with students and professors from his university, excitedly chatting with one another. It was late in the evening, and except for this hall, the university was deserted. The leaders of the student organisations and the professors that helped draft the plans for going forward were giving encouraging smiles, eager to hear the rector speak.\n\nErich knocked on the desk in front of him to silence the crowd. There was only one matter to be decided tonight, but it was controversial. His voice was not the loudest or most commanding, but as a teacher, he had experience with speaking: “Comrades, thank you all for coming tonight. As has been communicated beforehand, we have made contact with the major trade unions of the country and as expected, they have reacted favourably to our proposal to work together.”\n\nThe crowd whispered aggressively to each other at the good news, but silenced itself again once they noticed the rector would only speak if he had silence. “However, the union leaders want to be involved in our decision making from now on. Naturally, the unions will provide us with the griffonpower to start a revolution in earnest, but the union leaders are normal workers, separate from any formal education. I have proposed two courses of action, that I recommend to everyone present. Either keep the union leaders out of important decision making for now, or include them fully in our meetings here. Let us now hear all comrades who want to speak.”\n\nThe next few hours were filled with many present giving their own opinions, sometimes mere sentences, sometimes fiery orations for one proposal or the other. At the end of the night, however... "

 yale.14.d:0 "“How odd.” Captain Lars Schwertsohn scratched a talon against his skull. The numbers didn’t make sense. For years now, Cyrusval province had seen the lowest enlistment rates in all of Yale, but in the last two months, the numbers skyrocketed to even surpass Bruma. Had ‘the Stalliongrad of Griffonia’ changed? He sighed to himself; “And here I always thought those socialists were disloyal, I guess the Council did pick the right university after all.”\n\nIt was truly a mystery why the young griffons of Cyrusval were suddenly so enthusiastic about the military. They had all applied for different battalions and branches of service, and it stood out to the captain that none of them seemed interested in a career as a staff officer. Schwertsohn nodded at the numbers, smiling. Perhaps Arcturius had visited these students in their dreams, and now they finally knew their true duty?\n\nWhatever the case, his shift was almost over and he wanted to see his wife. No griffon read his reports anyway, so there was no harm in leaving Cyrusval’s new military fervour a secret for now. Captain Lars stuffed the papers into the filing cabinet, deciding not to report this curious abnormality further up the chain of command, instead going home early to his wife."
 yale.14.a:0 "Truly exemplary students!"
 
 yale.15.t:0 "The Truth!"
 yale.15.d:0 "It was incredibly hot in the basement of Cyrusval University, and this was before the presses were rolling. The room was packed with the machines and griffons necessary to mass produce pamphlets, leaflets and newspapers, which had taken a considerable chunk of the university budget. Erich Mühschnabel looked at the two papers on the table in front of him. Two different ideas for the first draft of ‘Wahrheit!’ the underground newspaper that was supposed to come out tomorrow.\n\nOf course, Erich had made sure to put in local stories that would be interesting for any reader, to attract attention, but he was split over which of the two drafts to push to the presses. One had anonymous essays and lengthy exposes about the theoretical background of socialism and anarchisim, truly works of fine scholarship. Interesting for some, but not a simple story a worker could rally behind. The other draft was the opposite, full of short, powerful articles about the capitalist crimes of the here and now, urging the worker to action. It was unworthy of journalism or academia, but it would resonate with the proletariat.\n\n The decision was up to Erich on how to set the tone for future editions and decide on his target audience. He cleaned his glasses, which had gotten damp from the moisty, sweaty room and called the griffon in charge of the presses."

 yale.16.t:0 "Soldiers of the Revolution"
 yale.16.d:0 "The revolutionaries convened in Lecture Hall A-12 yet again. Support for their cause was rising, with the government still clueless where the socialist sympathies were coming from. More and more supporters have flocked to the woods on the border with Angriver, where the revolutionaries are trained in the Angriver way of guerrilla warfare. However, the veteran soldiers training these militias have complained that there is a lack of discipline amongst recruits and that many simply spend most of their time listening to students hold speeches on the evils of capitalism or discussing how they’d run a commune.\n\nAs expected by Mühschnabel, most delegates present found this a wonderful development, praising the rise of class consciousness amongst the griffons. However, more practical griffons reminded those present that, for now, it would be best to force camp discipline and train the revolutionaries into true soldiers. Opinions were split and it was going to be another long night of debates."

 yale.17.t:0 "An Invitation for Archon Proteus"
 yale.17.d:0 "The Sword and Shield movement had been gaining popularity amongst the commoners and intellectuals alike, with a renewed focus on virtues, religion and military culture. But to ensure their success, the University of Bruma, which recently invited Prelate Michael onto their Executive Board, carefully planned their next step. Many griffons still questioned Sword and Shield, especially those griffons who were swayed by the false promises of Equestrian ideas such as socialism and harmony.\n\nThere was one griffon, however, who could help shore up support for the cause, even though he was not the greatest fan of public appearances. Archon Proteus, highest in the priesthood of Arcturius and Michael’s superior, would remind the griffons of Yale of their duty to their gods. Bruma University would invite Proteus for a visit to inspect and bless the standard of a new regiment for the student militia. Hopefully that would entice the Archon, who sometimes acted more like a knight than a priest, to come and support the Sword and Shield movement. The Prelate and university, would make sure that this event would be a grand celebration."
 yale.17.a:0 "Send the invitation to Griffenheim!"

 yale.18.t:0 "An Invitation for Archon Proteus"
 yale.18.d:0 "Archon Proteus received an invitation from the Prelate of Yale to attend a celebration in Bruma University, a place of learning which is heavily supported by his Archonate. Apparently, the Archon is to bless the standard of a new regiment for the local student militia. Although this invitation seems harmless, it is a sign of the renewed influence of religion in general and the worship of Arcturius in particular throughout the Yale Rectorate. Proteus intends to travel to Yale and preform the blessing, eager as he is to escape Griffenheim and its politicking. His visit may help secure Yale for the Archonate, for better or for worse."
 yale.18.a:0 "We can’t stop him from going either way."

 yale.19.t:0 "The Blessing of Arcturius"
 yale.19.d:0 "A huge crowd had gathered in Bruma’s Kaiserplatz, the city’s central square, but the middle of the plaza was kept open for the ceremony that was about to start. Firstly, the Archon appeared on the balcony of the city hall, to roaring cheers of the crowd. The chivalrous and down-to-earth Proteus was immensely popular with the public and many travelled for hours just to catch a glimpse of him. Behind him, at a respectable distance, Prelate Michael took his position, smiling at the crowd’s adoration for the Archon. Proteus seemed to instantly connect to the griffons present, making them forget everything else.\n\nThe sound of military drums closing on the square silenced the crowd, and from around the corner, the Sword and Shield militia marched into the square. They were wearing their grey dress uniform, lined with golden thread and a grey cap with a white plume supplemented their formal attire. In front walked the standard bearer, carrying a golden banner depicting a sword behind a shield, surrounded by a laurel wreath. On the banner it said: ‘Virtus, Justitia, Arcturius.’ When the student militia had reached its positions, they formally greeted the Archon, after which the square was silent, waiting for the Archon’s speech.\n\n“Thank you, citizens of Yale, for inviting me on this beautiful day. Your Prelate has asked me to say a few words to you and I will. As you know, Arcturius always had a special place in his heart for Bruma and your university has produced many wonderful knights and priests.” The crowd cheered at the Archon’s praise and he had to gesture them to calm down. “However, I have been told that not every griffon in Yale has decided to follow the divine path. Many are confused and lost in these uncertain times, where the world seems small but the challenges to our wellbeing loom large. But remember that Arcturius will fight for those in need. I implore you, follow the God’s call and safe those who stray too far. Then Yale’s future, and that of the Empire, will be secure!”\n\nAfter the Archon was done speaking, he was joined by Prelate Michael and they chanted a hymn to bless the Sword and Shield banner. Proteus then spent the rest of the day chatting with soldiers and students and even tested out one of their rifles himself. News of the Archon’s speech spread quickly and many griffons heeded the words of Proteus. The following week, all temples in Yale were packed to the brim as many griffons returned to Arcturius’s protection."
 yale.19.a:0 "Praise Arcturius, protector of griffonkind!"

 yale.20.t:0 "Michael’s Ascension"
 yale.20.d:0 "The Academic Council had to acknowledge that a lot of things had changed for the better since Bruma university took the initiative in reforming Yale. With religion and discipline, the common griffon was included into the nation, where scientists and high idealism had failed. The social scientists of Bruma understood the wants of the people more than the others, more even than Cyrusval, which always proclaimed they were the only ones who fought for the citizenry.\n\nIt was this slow change of perspective, along with a personal letter of recommendation from Archon Proteus, published in every major newspaper, that forced the Council to make a move. The rectors invited prelate Michael, head of the Arcturian church in Yale for negotiations. When the prelate arrived in Greenback’s Borean Wiedergreiff Building, the Council saw a griffon who would not be impressed by their power and intellect.\n\nMost strikingly, the prelate was reasonable, way more reasonable than a priest ever should have been. He would keep respecting the universities if he was on the council, but simply give a voice to the divine and popular will. He swore that a seat on the council would finally mend the rift between the elite and the common griffon and most of all, he promised the Archonate would respect Yale’s tradition if it was led by Michael.\n\nIn the end, the council voted in favour of allowing Michael into the council, with only protests from Cyrusval."
 yale.20.a:0 "The Prelate will preserve Yale."

 yale.21.t:0 "The Yale Prelature"
 yale.21.d:0 "The Yale Rectorate has always been a country where many ungodly and dangerous ideas were allowed to fester in the name of ‘academic debate’. The armchair intellectuals failed to gain the support of the populace, however, and were forced to led the more religiously minded griffons in their country lead the way. Under the Schwert und Schild (Sword and Shield) movement, Arcturius in particular was being popularised in university and temple alike.\n\nNow Prelate Michael of Arcturius has been voted into a leadership position in Yale and the priest has immediately pledged support to Archon Proteus in Griffenheim. Will we allow the loyal griffons of Yale back into the imperial fold?"
 yale.21.a:0 "Another fiefdom joins the call of the righteous!"
 yale.21.b:0 "We cannot accept their servitude at this time."

 yale.22.t:0 "Denied Our Place"
 yale.22.d:0 "It seems there has been a misunderstanding with the archonate in Griffenheim, as they have refused our request for vassalage. This has come as a personal blow to Michael, whose steadfast faith in the church has taken a big hit. Nevertheless, the prelate has vowed to continue to fight for Arcturius and Yale, even if it has to be knight against knight. It seems Arcturius will determine who is right on the sacred field of battle."
 yale.22.a:0 "How could they abandon the faithful?"

 yale.23.t:0 "The Status of Yale"
 yale.23.d:0 "For a while now, Yale has been afforded great autonomy within the Griffonian Empire, as a mere vassal of the archons. Now that the Empire is rising again, however, we must consider what to do with the citizens of Yale. Prelate Michael has ensured us that the griffons would not object to total integration of their domain into the Empire itself, but he has stressed that letting Yale mind its own business could be a better way to profit from his prelature."
 yale.23.a:0 "Welcome them to the Empire!"
 yale.23.b:0 "Welcome them to the Empire! (Yale integrates you!)"
 yale.23.c:0 "The current arrangement suits us best."

 yale.24.t:0 "The Empire Maintains our Autonomy"
 yale.24.d:0 "Our offer to give up our privileges and become a normal province of the Griffonian Empire has been refused by the archons. In a letter signed by the three, they explain to Michael that he and the griffons of Yale will serve the gods best as their own autonomous prelature within the empire. They cite the scientific and military fervour of the Yalish in particular as reasons for their decision.\n\nSo it has been decided, and so it shall be. We will be the Emperor’s Sword and Shield, the Arcturius to the Imperial Boreas. And we will march to the ends of the world, if it was is required of us."
 yale.24.a:0 "We will stand in the grace of the divine."

 yale.25.t:0 "Grover VI Murdered"
 yale.25.d:0 "Terrible news spread throughout Yale. A most horrendous deed happened in Griffenheim. Emperor Grover VI was murdered by the military. In the marketplaces, conversation is hushed, no griffon meaning to be disrespectful by speaking up about it. In the halls of the universities the students made impromptu shrines of flowers and candles, and even amidst communist pamphlets in the halls of Cyrusval’s social science faculty, sorrow clouded the air.\n\nAs night fell, a rushed council meeting was held in Yale. Every rector denounced the cruel murder of the Child-Emperor, but what should have united the academics, instead divided them. Erich Mühschabel, Cyrusval’s rector, demanded that the Yale military leadership be relieved of command before they could come to a similar idea as the general in Griffenheim. The rector of Gamia warned Mikusian of how this death would absolutely divide the country and that measures had to be taken soon, while Middenheim’s delegation recommended drastic increases in military spending if Yale was serious about any sort of retaliation for this horrid act.\n\nDeep in the night, when all delegation were heard, the Rector Magnificus closed the council, promising them that they would reconvene soon. Something had to be done, but if Mikusian was not careful, the balance of Yale’s council would be disrupted and radicals would be allowed to take charge."

As for all their dedication to the revolution, most griffons remained religious and they have not dared to touch their places of worship. This faith is starting to be used against the socialists, however, as under orders from Prelate Michael, the clergy has started to ramp up its fight against the revolution. During every sermon, the priests of the country remind their congregation that the revolution is godless. Some go as far as to accuse us of worshipping Maar! Worst of all, it seems the church’s words are starting to stick in the minds of the proletariat, leading them right into reactionary claws.\n\nThe revolutionaries have yet to decide on their response. Although the student, soldier and workers councils were quick to condemn the church’s allegations, most griffons are hesitant to take any further action. Revolution is a messy process and everything depends on popular support. Action against the church, many feared, was sure to be unpopular. Some griffons floated the idea of making counterpropaganda, but many of our writers protested against directly challenging the word of the church. Only a few griffons supported armed intervention, but such a radical step would require our soldiers to shed blood on holy ground, something we are not sure they are prepared to do.

The university refused to be part of what they named “the spending of lives in useless conflicts.’’\n\nThis left Mikusian with no choice but to travel to Griffenheim to announce Yale’s formal secession from the Empire.

Thus, those three decided to stick with the Empire, meaning a majority of rectors chose for loyalty to Griffenheim.\n\nMikusian sent a letter to Griffenheim the same day to announce to Eros that the Yale Rectorate fully intended on keeping the current arrangement it had with Griffenheim. He hoped the Archons would limit their ambitions and let the Rectorate be, but he feared that the country had to prepare for the worst, even though they tried to stay loyal."

#Decisions
 YAL_university_focused_research:0 "Research Focus Program"
 YAL_university_focused_research_desc:0 "An effort to focus research in particular fields by directing scientists from different universities in a centralised manner is increasing the speed at which we can conduct Research and Development operations."
 YAL_equipment_focus:0 "Focus on Personal Weapon Development"
 YAL_equipment_focus_desc:0 "Infantry are still the primary fighting force of any nation and they are equipped with small arms. Rifles, machine guns, mortars, grenades and anti-tank weaponry in the claws of sturdy soldiers will win any conflict."
 YAL_infantry_focus:0 "Focus on Special Forces"
 YAL_infantry_focus_desc:0 "Our country does not have the griffons to spare to fill an army of general soldiers. Our armed forces must be honed precisely to operate under any condition. For this we must devise gruelling training programs, specialised equipment, and light weaponry for use in amphibious, high altitude and air landing operations."
 YAL_support_focus:0 "Focus on Support Equipment"
 YAL_support_focus_desc:0 "Our research is focused on improving the design of our support equipment. The small things such as recon equipment, shovels, radios, and field hospitals can prove decisive in combat. Using knowledge from the army itself, along with theory and doctrine, we will be able to make a decisive push in this field."
 YAL_artillery_focus:0 "Focus on Artillery Research"
 YAL_artillery_focus_desc:0 "The adage of the imperial military has always been that Arcturius is on the side with the most artillery. This is not an unwise statement, as those who can bring the most firepower to bear on an enemy will surely have a decisive advantage. With larger caliber rounds, advanced explosive or armour piercing ammunitions, we will be able to enhance the killing potential of our support weapons."
 YAL_land_doctrine_focus:0 "Focus on Army Doctrine"
 YAL_land_doctrine_focus_desc:0 "A soldier that is not present on the battlefield is as useful as a dead griffon. Waging war is a logistical operation of an unprecedented scale and the strategy behind our campaigns will have to be carefully considered. By adapting from lessons learned by generals from all over the world, we will be able to improve our own doctrine."
 YAL_industry_focus:0 "Focus on Industrial Development"
 YAL_industry_focus_desc:0 "Ultimately a war is won by the amount of griffons we will be able to arm, the amount of planes and tanks we will be able to construct, and the resources we will be able to extract. Therefore the most effective increase to our capacity to wage war will come through improving our assembly lines, extraction tools, and countrywide logistical operations."
 YAL_racial_focus:0 "Focus on Griffology"
 YAL_racial_focus_desc:0 "The griffon body and mind, and the magic feats it can produce are an untapped well of research. Enchanting could strengthen modern armour and make our weapons and tools more efficient. Magic and science can be melded together to create spectacular results with many practical implications."
 YAL_armor_focus:0 "Focus on Panzer Research"
 YAL_armor_focus_desc:0 "Armoured warfare is the future, as the speed, firepower and protection a tank offers is unrivalled by more traditional weapons. However, the potential improvements to these weapon platforms are clear. Better guns, smart anti-personnel weaponry, and the integration of electronic technologies will pave the way to victory."
 YAL_electronics_focus:0 "Focus on Electronics Research"
 YAL_electronics_focus_desc:0 "Although electricity, as a power source, is not new, technology powered by it keeps advancing. Most curious are the implications for long range detection technology which could warn of approaching hostiles and the usage of electromechanical computers to solve mathematical equations."
 YAL_naval_focus:0 "Focus on Ship Design"
 YAL_naval_focus_desc:0 "Our nation did not traditionally possess an oceangoing navy, but now that it borders the sea, it is imperative that we copy and improve naval designs to build our own fleet. The RFP will contribute to our new and modern navy."
 YAL_naval_doctrine_focus:0 "Focus on Naval Doctrine"
 YAL_naval_doctrine_focus_desc:0 "Without a destination, no wind is favourable, thus we must direct our navy or it will simply fall apart in a real combat situation. Developing doctrines for this new naval program will be challenging, as combat takes place beneath the waves, on the seas and above it. We will have to devise a strategy to match our ambitions and our potential opponents."
 YAL_air_focus:0 "Focus on Aeroplane Design"
 YAL_air_focus_desc:0 "Airplanes have a role to play in new conflicts. Aircraft design is advances at a rapid pace, however, and the Research Focus Program can assist in providing our own designs. More nimble and better armed fighter planes or bombers able to deliver more payload, different design philosophies can lead to radically different planes and we ought to make the planes that suit our needs."
 YAL_air_doctrine_focus:0 "Focus on Air Doctrine"
 YAL_air_doctrine_focus_desc:0 "The unique properties of airpower require a separate doctrine to set it apart from land -or in our case, non-mechanised flying- forces. The ability to project force quickly and reach over enemy frontlines into their heartlands bring new strategic considerations to the table. We must carefully consider how to use our air force in the way that will suit our military objectives."

  #Revolution Decisions

 YAL_revolution_support:0 "Preparing for Revolution"
 YAL_revolution_support_desc:0 "Now that Cyrusval University has taken the lead amongst the universities of Yale, it has started to plot for a revolution in secret. By using the Student Vanguard and the Faculty of Social Science to its advantage, the hopeful revolutionaries seek to shore up support of the workers, soldiers and intellectuals of Yale. Increasing support will take time and effort, but launching the revolution too soon may have disastrous consequences.\n\n\n\nCurrent §Yworker§! support: [YAL.GetWorkerSupport].\nCurrent §Mintellectual§! support: [YAL.GetIntellectualSupport].\nCurrent §Rmilitary§! support: [YAL.GetMilitarySupport]."

 YAL_for_the_soldiers:0 "Go to the Soldiers"
 YAL_for_the_soldiers_desc:0 "Our military is not impressive, but it will still be a formidable foe for our revolution. Luckily, the underpaid and underappreciated soldiers of Yale will be more than willing to listen to the promises made by the Student Vanguard."
 YAL_work_for_freedom:0 "Work for Freedom"
 YAL_work_for_freedom_desc:0 "Many things must be prepared for a revolution. Not only do we need brave griffons to carry the day, we need provisions, medical supplies, and of course, banners ready. In secret, we will work  harder to supply our comrades in the upcoming struggle."
 YAL_secure_arms:0 "Secure Arms"
 YAL_secure_arms_desc:0 "We will make good use of our connections in the army to smuggle weapons out of the armouries. When the reactionaries try to overthrow the people’s revolution, they will be surprised to find that we have guns too. "
 YAL_historical_materialism:0 "Historical Materialism"
 YAL_historical_materialism_desc:0 "History used to be the profession of nationalists, embellishing the myths of their ancient nations to distract the griffons from their own exploitation. The Faculty will unmask this history and show a radically different outlook. The world is ruled by modes of production, which structure a class system. And the age of capitalism is reaching its end..."
 YAL_verelendung_thesis:0 "The Verelendung Thesis"
 YAL_verelendung_thesis_desc:0 "With machines replacing griffons in the production line, production increases, but wages stagnate. Capital accumulates at the top, but workers grow less and less necessary. Once proud artisans are now little more than cogs in an oppressive machine. The true contradiction of capitalism is thus: The economy grows larger, but the worker’s condition, as a necessity, becomes more miserable."
 YAL_reject_transition:0 "Reject Transition"
 YAL_reject_transition_desc:0 "The most accepted communist theories, such as those practiced in Stalliongrad, favour a post-revolutionary ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’. Sadly, our comrades overseas seem to have forgotten about the temporary nature of this arrangement. To ensure that the revolution is not perverted at the final hour, we will return all means of production and power to the workers."
 YAL_free_association:0 "Free Association"
 YAL_free_association_desc:0 "The state is the premier means of oppression. If there is to be true liberty, even the most liberal of democracies will not do. Only a community of freely associated individuals can guarantee the freedom that is the right of every being. Production will be in the hands of the workers and there will be no structures of power forcing anygriffon to do anything they don’t want."
 YAL_support_underground_press:0 "Set up Underground Presses"
 YAL_support_underground_press_desc:0 "The extra funding from the Academic Council can be put to good use by buying printing presses. With these machines, we will be able to print large amounts of propaganda. It will just be a case of fitting the machines into a safe place and finding authors, artists and other personnel to spread the word of the revolution!"


  #Archives Decisions 
 YAL_archive_building:0 "Building the Archives"
 YAL_archive_building_desc:0 "The construction of the Great Archives of Yale is a monumental task that requires massive amounts of funds, materials, and labour. However, for the sake of all griffonkind, and to fulfill the dreams of the visionary Borean Wiedergreiff, we will complete this monument to scientific knowledge."
 YAL_start_building_part_1:0 "The Foundation"
 YAL_start_building_part_1_desc:0 "Mathematics are the foundation of the sciences, and without them we would not know about the true nature of the world. But just like we can base our science on sturdy mathematics, so too must the Archives be built on an unshakeable foundation. Let us begin in earnest!"
 YAL_start_building_part_2:0 "The Framework"
 YAL_start_building_part_2_desc:0 "A steel and concrete framework will hold up the building and prevent it from collapsing in on itself. Like the scientific method guides our research, so will this framework keep the building stable. Borean's magical enchantments will add further protection and support to the structure."
 YAL_start_building_part_3:0 "The Structure"
 YAL_start_building_part_3_desc:0 "Next, the structure of the archives will have to be made. Borean's plans are in the shape of a great tower with many floors. Many entrypoints will make it easy for griffons to fly directly to the right floor, showing both the grandeur and openness of the scientific pursuit. This will be the brute-force part of the construction. To work!"
 YAL_start_building_part_4:0 "The Interior"
 YAL_start_building_part_4_desc:0 "Inside the Archives, the walls will be finished with marble, with sturdy bookshelves carved into the stone. These will house all the knowledge of Griffonia so meticulously gathered by the universities over the years. Of course, many comfortable reading rooms will be made as well, so that anygriffon can enjoy reading the works of science and literature the Archives store."
 YAL_final_touches:0 "The Decoration"
 YAL_final_touches_desc:0 "To complete the Archives, many works of art will need to be commissioned. Especially the lowest and highest levels will contain frescos by renowned artists, along with statues representing the sciences. All will marvel at the greatest work of science and art the world has ever seen. It is so close now."

 YAL_digging_trenches_desc:0 "Gerhard Silverbeak was born in 929 in the province of Osnabeak in the Strawberry Duchy. At the age of 18, he joined the prestigious Griffenheim Imperial Military Academy, completing an education as an engineer. For the next 45 years of his life, he would serve with distinction, proving especially resilient during the Republican uprisings where his defensive doctrines proved the undoing of many Republican offensives. In 992, he retired from the Imperial Army with the rank of major general. Since then, he has joined Canterberley Academy as a professor, being an adamant proponent of the importance of defensive doctrine within modern warfare."
 YAL_digging_trenches2:0 "Phase One"
 YAL_digging_trenches2_desc:0 "Phase One of the Gerhard Line has seen the construction of a number of strongpoints throughout the nation. These will act as the lynchpin of future defensive developments, acting as logistical hubs, command centres, and mustering points for the Yale Defense Force."
 YAL_defensive_tactics:0 "Gerhard Line"
 YAL_defensive_tactics_desc:0 "Proposed by famed general and professor, Gerhard Silverbeak, the Gerhard line is a series of comprehensive defensive lines which offer a defense-in-depth for the Yale Defense Force.

 YAL_archives_constructed:0 "The Great Archives of Yale"
 YAL_archives_constructed_desc:0 "The vision of Borean Wiedergreiff, an enormous repository for all griffon knowledge, has been completed. For years we have toiled to finish this monument to science and now the great spire stands. The construction, hundreds of metres high, adorned with marble statues of the sciences and arts and many other ornaments, is a masterpiece of architecture. Every day, laygriff and scientist alike visit the structure to learn more about our world, or to simply enjoy the sight of the building. With the Archives, we will gain an enormous scientific advantage compared to those who will not enjoy access to its contents."
 YAL_agricultural_study:0 "Agricultural Study"
 YAL_agricultural_study_desc:0 "New tools and methods to grow food have severely reduced the griffonpower needed to sustain our people. The claws that have been freed by the advance of agricultural technology can now be put to use in the factories to propel our nation forwards."

 YAL_archived_knowledge7_desc:0 "The minds of all the continent’s brightest focussed in one place has given us all access to man new perspectives. This has helped out every scientist, as they now have new theories to consider and new methods to use in their own work.  There is still some work left, but we are getting closer to the boundaries of our knowledge."
 YAL_archived_knowledge8:0 "Letting the Owl Fly"
 YAL_archived_knowledge8_desc:0 "The owl has been associated with wisdom by many races, and it was considered a sign by most griffons that many owls decided to nest in the Spire. Therefore, the last phase of research has been called the Owl-Project. Every book and manuscript will be read, reviewed and placed into context, so that we will gain complete knowledge of the Archives’ content."
 YAL_archived_knowledge9:0 "The Owl ascends to the Sky"

 YAL_gerhard_silverbeak_desc:0 "Gerhard Silverbeak was born in 929 in the province of Osnabeak in the Strawberry Duchy. At the age of 18, he joined the prestigious Griffenheim Imperial Military Academy, completing an education as an engineer. For the next 45 years of his life, he would serve with distinction, proving especially resilient during the Republican uprisings where his defensive doctrines proved the undoing of many Republican offensives. In 992, he retired from the Imperial Army with the rank of major general. Since then, he has joined Canterberley Academy as a professor, being an adamant proponent of the importance of defensive doctrine within modern warfare."
 YAL_heinz_featherhoff_desc:0 "Heinz Featherhoff was born in 941 in the town of Asselt in Greifenmarschen. Born to a local merchant of the petite bourgeois class, Featherhoff’s father managed to secure his son a post to Canterberley Academy at the age of 18, where he studied as an infantry officer before joining the Imperial Army. During his 30 years of service, Featherhoff fought in the Republican Uprising, gaining the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. After his tenure in the army, he rejoined his alma mater as a professor. Recently, he has shown an affinity towards the radical Red Guard, and is seen as the only senior staff who openly supports their views."
