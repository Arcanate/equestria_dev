 griffonian.150.t:0 "Fighter Competition"
 griffonian.150.desc:0 "A recent study of modern air combat has shown a critical weakness in our air force. Our fighters are severely behind developments in other countries. The Air Ministry has initiated a crash program to acquire a modern fighter as soon as feasible. Since domestic development would take an unacceptable amount of time, it has been decided to purchase a license from abroad. An additional budget has been authorized.\n\nExperts differ on what type of plane would be best suited to modernize our fighter wings."
