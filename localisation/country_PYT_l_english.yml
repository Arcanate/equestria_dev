### Ideas ###
PYT_the_peasant_republic:0 "The Peasant Republic"
PYT_the_peasant_republic_desc:0 "The Republic of Peasants was founded in 720 ALB after the peasantry rose up against Duke Erebus Blacktalon - one of Grover I's many early political opponents. The Emperor rewarded the peasantry by allowing them to organise their own government.\n\n Thus Greifenmarschen was created, a peculiar nation even by Griffonian standards. It can safely be called the first Republic on the continent, but it can also be considered the most flawed Republic on the continent.\n\n Operating on the principles of total equality and liberty for all of its citizens, quite literally every single minor thing in Greifenmarschen is voted on, and while this system evokes an unmatched sense of loyalty to the Republic it also means that implemeting any sort of reforms will be nigh impossible."
PYT_the_peasant_army:0 "The Bauernmiliz"
PYT_the_peasant_army_desc:0 "Greifenmarschen's Army or rather the Bauernmiliz suffers from many of the same issues that its government does. Officers and plans are voted upon, any sense of discipline is nonexistent, and any reforms are hard to pass.\n\n On the bright side there is no shortage of eager recruits ready and willing to defend their beloved Republic."
PYT_rural_economy:0 "Ruralism"
PYT_rural_economy_desc:0 "The nature of Greifenmarschen's government and people has made it rather hard to create any proper industrial centers, as such most of our economy is reliant on farming and mining."

### Focuses ###
PYT_initial_army_reforms:0 "Reforming the Bauernmiliz"
PYT_initial_army_reforms_desc:0 "For decades now the army of the Republic has remained untouched, becoming increasingly outdated in this age of innovation and revolution. Our faction has finally managed to gather enough support to start pushing some reforms through, but it remains to be decided how exactly the army will be reformed."
PYT_militia_roots:0 "Perfect As Is"
PYT_militia_roots_desc:0 "Our peasant militias have bravely and reliably defended the country from foreign incursions for centuries now, holding the river banks and crushing any noble fool who tried to subdue us. Why change the wheels of a working wagon?"
PYT_call_to_arms:0 "A Call to Arms"
PYT_call_to_arms_desc:0 "The Bauernmiliz is a purely voluntary force, but that fact does not mean that we can not ask our citizens to volunteer. There are surely thousands of willing griffons ready to fight for their country, we need only to put out the word."
PYT_actual_conscription:0 "Fight For Your Home"
PYT_actual_conscription_desc:0 "While the Bauernmiliz may not be as professional a force compared to the other militaries of Griffonia, they do possess their own distinct advantage. They will fight for their homes, their families and their country. And, if nessicary, they will die for their homes."
PYT_guerilla_warfare:0 "From the Shadows"
PYT_guerilla_warfare_desc:0 "The Bauernmiliz is not only consigned to our official divisions but rather is comprised of thousands of small cells operating out of our territory. Regardless of our defeat on the battlefield, the Bauernmiliz will continue the fight behind enemy lines, striking from the shadows until they can be liberated by our forces."
PYT_actual_guns:0 "The Right Tools"
PYT_actual_guns_desc:0 "If the Bauernmiliz are to fight on the battlefield, they will need the right tools for the job. There are thousands of citizens who hold surplus weapons and tools, and many would gladly donate them to the Bauernmiliz."
PYT_train_our_troops:0 "Proper Training"
PYT_train_our_troops_desc:0 "By accelerating and streamlining our training regimen we can ensure that the next batch of recruits reaches the front faster and better trained."
PYT_born_of_the_land:0 "Born of the Land"
PYT_born_of_the_land_desc:0 "Our soldiers all have an incredible amount of experience with the land and terrain of our homeland, acquired through generations working and developing the land. We can gather these techniques together to ensure that our forces can subsist in even the harshest conditions."
PYT_stock_the_villages:0 "Stock the Villages"
PYT_stock_the_villages_desc:0 "We must be ready for conflict, and many of our villages are perfect spots for storing equipment for use in emergencies. We can also encourage local production of weapons to further increase our self-sufficiency."
PYT_slight_reforms:0 "The Volkssturm"
PYT_slight_reforms_desc:0 "The methods of the Bauernmiliz have been perfected through our advancements, and it has truly transformed. It is now a true army of the people. The Volkssturm stands ready to fight, and die if necessary, for their homes."
PYT_modern_guns:0 "Modern Rifles"
PYT_modern_guns_desc:0 "Due to the lack of the standardization of equipment amongst our forces, many of our soldiers are stuck with woefully out of date rifles. This is not currently a problem, but if we were ever to engage in combat with another nation, our soldiers would quickly be outmatched by their superior equipment. We must invest in designing and researching new rifles to solve this dilemma."
PYT_modern_artillery:0 "Artillery Implementation"
PYT_modern_artillery_desc:0 "Artillery remains a rare sight amongst our forces, with many units of the Bauernmiliz reluctant to adopt them due to a reliance on tradition and an aversion to change. But the prospect of artillery shattering our enemies before a grand attack by the infantry is too enticing to ignore. Artillery is the future, we only need to develop our own models before implementation can begin."
PYT_support_troops:0 "Support Squads"
PYT_support_troops_desc:0 "While most of the volunteers for the Bauernmiliz are excited to fight for their country on the frontlines, there is a distinct lack of support units amongst our forces. While not as exciting as the frontline roles, support roles are equally as vital to the war effort. We shall expand and develop these support units, thus creating a strong support structure for our army."
PYT_radio_implementation:0 "Radio Implementation"
PYT_radio_implementation_desc:0 "The prospective military uses of the radio are practically infinite. With better communication, we can overhaul and streamline our entire command structure. If we can develop our own radio models we can proceed with these ambitious plans."
PYT_motorization:0 "Motorisation"
PYT_motorization_desc:0 "Very few griffons in Greifenmarschen own, or would even recognize a car. But with the existing overhauls of our army in place, we can finally start to motorize our army. Motorized forces have the potential to outperform regular infantry in most aspects, to ignore such an advancement in technology would be folly of the highest order."
PYT_professionalism:0 "Strictly Professional"
PYT_professionalism_desc:0 "It is time for change at last. We are surrounded by nations fielding drilled armies of full-time soldiers. If we are to retain our independence and liberty, we must adapt and modernize our army."
PYT_implement_army_drills:0 "Standardized Equipment"
PYT_implement_army_drills_desc:0 "The Bauernmiliz has no real concept of a standardized piece of equipment, or doctrine for that matter. In the past our soldiers have simply used what was available at the time, and it has worked adequately for our needs in the past. But if we are to drag the Bauernmiliz kicking and screaming into modernity, we will have to establish some sort of standardization amongst our equipment."
PYT_armouries:0 "Proper Armouries"
PYT_armouries_desc:0 "The logistical system of the Bauernmiliz is a nightmare for all involved. Few griffons even know where the majority of the reserve arms are stored, with thousands of small villages having their own set of rifles hidden away in some compartment or another. This insanity must be stopped, we shall gather all of our arms and place them in properly secured and documented facilities."
PYT_instill_discipline:0 "A Sense of Discipline"
PYT_instill_discipline_desc:0 "If the Bauernmiliz is to face our enemies on the battlefield, they must be utterly unshakable from their duties. If the officers tell them to charge, they must charge. And if the officers tell them to retreat, they must retreat. Such a sense of discipline is currently lacking in our forces but through an intense training program, we can make sure that every single soldier will do his duty when the time comes."
PYT_an_actual_officer_core:0 "A New Officer Core"
PYT_an_actual_officer_core_desc:0 "While the current system of allowing soldiers to elect their officers makes for happy soldiers, it does not make good officers. We must fix this if we are ever to fight in a real war. Our current officers will be tested, those who prove themselves will stay, while those who do not will be demoted. After this, we will ensure that officers will be promoted by merit, thus solving this problem for good."
PYT_the_peoples_army:0 "The Volksarmee"
PYT_the_peoples_army_desc:0 "After an immense amount of reforms and changes, the Bauernmiliz has been transformed into a professional force. Our soldiers stand ready and able to fight with absolute discipline no matter the situation, and our officers now show an air of authority. The title of Bauernmiliz no longer fits our well trained army. Henceforth, it shall be known as the Volksarmee, a proper title for a proper army."
PYT_implement_conscription:0 "Implement Conscription"
PYT_implement_conscription_desc:0 "Conscription is a controversial topic within Griefenmarschen, as membership in the Bauernmiliz has traditionally been a purely voluntary endeavor. But the fact of the matter is that we are already outgunned and outmanned by our potential enemies. Whatever the public may feel about conscription, it is a necessary evil if we are to protect ourselves."
PYT_streamlined_training:0 "Streamlined Training"
PYT_streamlined_training_desc:0 "Currently, basic training in the Bauernmiliz is heavily based on what unit of the militia you join. Many units have unique methods of putting recruits through basic training, causing the average time it takes for a soldier to get ready for combat to vary wildly. To fix this problem, we shall study the methods of the most efficient units and implement them as standard practice across the entire Bauernmiliz."
PYT_auxiliary_roles:0 "Auxiliary Military Roles"
PYT_auxiliary_roles_desc:0 "While frontline fighters may be the most famous amongst our armed forces, they are not by any means the only ones. To truly create an effective fighting force, various support units are necessary to enable the soldiers to fight at their peak capacity. Logistics, maintenance and more are crucial to maintaining a highly effective fighting force, it would be wise to establish such support for the Bauernmiliz."

PYT_the_economy:0 "A New Economy For a New Age"
PYT_the_economy_desc:0 "The new millenium has dawned and with it economic revolution. Farmers abroad use new tools which require less labour, leaving those without work to move to cities. So far we have avoided such change, but our economy is becoming dangerously uncompetitive. Now that our faction has support needed for reforms it is time to decide what to do about the matter."
PYT_agrarianism:0 "Stick to the Classics"
PYT_agrarianism_desc:0 "Ruralism and agrarianism are defining aspects of our country. Changing these would require changing what we are. We must remain true to ourselves and focus on reforming agriculture, which is the foundation of our existence."
PYT_connect_countryside:0 "Connect the Countryside"
PYT_connect_countryside_desc:0 "Unlike in cities, in rural areas everything is far apart. If we wish for our populace to have easy access to services such as schools, hospices, temples and markets, we must improve our dirt paths into proper paved roads."
PYT_support_local_business:0 "Support Local Businesses"
PYT_support_local_business_desc:0 "Instead of focusing on markets and companies in Oldwingburg, we should aid small businesses in our villages and towns who serve the locals and provide them what they need. This means griffons will be less inclined to move to cities and will instead remain on their farms."
PYT_foreign_experts:0 "Public Works Projects"
PYT_foreign_experts_desc:0 "To reduce unemployment and to increase the availability of services in rural areas, we will begin public works projects intended to build schools, hospitals, wells, sewers and bridges in the underdeveloped countryside. The funding will come entirely from the pockets of the government, instead those of urban entrepreneurs who only care about urban areas."
PYT_initial_modernisation_efforts:0 "Into the Modern Age"
PYT_initial_modernisation_efforts_desc:0 "Now that we have laid the foundations, we can begin to modernize our agrarian country, without necessarily urbanizing it. We will adopt new technologies from abroad, reform education and pass new laws, ultimately proving to the world that modernity does not require sacrificing tradition and identity!"
PYT_distribute_land:0 "Work the Land"
PYT_distribute_land_desc:0 "For decades now griffons have been abandoning farms and moving to towns and cities such as Oldwingburg in search of a living. It is time for this trend to be reversed! The countryside, now having proper infrastructure, shall be repopulated and abandoned land will be reclaimed."
PYT_subsidise_agrculture:0 "Subsidise the Farmers"
PYT_subsidise_agrculture_desc:0 "Instead of supporting the merchants and artisans in urban areas, the government should aid the farmers especially after poor harvests. With this we will not only ensure further development of the countryside but also receive support from grateful farmers."

### Events ###
marschen.1.t:0 "The Matter of the Economy"
marschen.1.d:0 "The Council met in the Temple of Boreas in Oldwingburg to discuss the recent proposals of economy reform. Members of different factions supported different proposals: KPG and NAP generally advocated rapid industrialisation and modernisation to drag the country to the new millenium, while GKVP and GVHP preferred more conservative agrarian reforms aimed at modernizing the countryside and focusing on agricultural production.\n\nThe debate lasted late into the night, until finally the Council agreed on what direction Greifenmarschen's economy would take."
marschen.1.a:0 "No point in fixing what's already perfect"
marschen.1.b:0 "Industrialisation is the way forward!"

marschen.2.t:0 "Derailing the Argument"
marschen.2.d:0 "Today grave news arrived in Oldwingburg about a terrible accident near Landstal. A passenger train derailed on the old railroad from Romau to Oldwingburg, built with Imperial funding decades ago. Dozens of griffons have died and almost a hundred injured. Erebus Whiteplume proposed this day to be a day of national mounring, and the Council unianimously voted in favour of his proposal.\n\nDietrich and Wingbert, both proponents of industrialization and modernization, now say the accident was the fault of the agrarian program which moved funds for renovating vital railways to building roads in the sparsely populated countryside. They say this disaster would've been avoided if the government had instead focused on maintaining the vital railroads between urban areas."
marschen.2.a:0 "How was I supposed to know the rails were broken?!"

marschen.3.t:0 "Local Businesses on the Rise"
marschen.3.d:0 "Our decision to support small, local businesses in the countryside with subsidies and helpful legislation is beginning to pay off. Not only are old companies staying afloat, but new ones are being founded every week, with some Oldwingburgers even moving to the countryside to start businesses of their own.\n\n[From.GetLeader], who had supported these reforms from the beginning, used the opportunity to convince othes of the effectiveness of their agrarian policy, gathering more political support for their cause."
marschen.3.a:0 "The economy is booming!"

marschen.4.t:0 "Öffentliche Bauarbeiten Bears Fruit"
marschen.4.d:0 "Our public works projects are proving to be successful. Not only has unemployment sharply decreased, but peasants in rural areas now have access to goods and services which before were exclusive for urbanites. As such, many griffons in the countryside will likely vote for us in the next elections."

marschen.14.d:0 "Once again it is time to hold elections, elect new judges and reshuffle the Council. As always, the peasants were eager to vote and gathered in large crowds across the country to choose their local leaders. In addition each village sent a representative to Oldwingburg to elect the Statthalter, who would lead the government until the next elections.\n\n Out of the many candidates, only four were likely to win the elections: old and ever-popular Erebus Whiteplume, nationalist and Herzlander supremacist Dietrich Mach, Equestrian immigrant Archibald Dawnclaw and communist Wingbert Rohmer. The vote was held in the Temple of Boreas and ultimately the griffon with the most votes was..."
