PYT_the_peasant_republic:0 "The Peasant Republic"
PYT_the_peasant_republic_desc:0 "Founded in 720 ALB after the peasantry rose up against Duke Erebus Blacktalon - one of Grover I's many early political opponents. The Emperor repaid the peasantry's loyalty by allowing them to organise their own government.\n\n Thus Greifenmarschen was created, a peculiar nation even by Griffonian standards it can safely be called the first Republic on the continent... it can however also be considered the most flawed Republic on the continent.\n\n Operating on the principles of total equality and liberty for all of its citizens quite literally every single minor thing in Greifenmarschen is voted on, and while this system evokes an unmatched sense of loyalty to the Republic it also means that implemeting any sort of reforms will be nigh impossible."
PYT_the_peasant_army:0 "The Bauernmiliz"
PYT_the_peasant_army_desc:0 "Greifenmarschen's Army or rather the Bauernmiliz suffers from many of the same issues that its government does. Officers and plans are voted upon, any sense of discipline is nonexistent, and any reforms are hard to pass.\n\n On the bright side there is no shortage of eager recruits ready and willing to defend their beloved Republic."
PYT_rural_economy:0 "Ruralism"
PYT_rural_economy_desc:0 "The nature of Greifenmarschen's government and people has made it rather hard to create any proper industrial centers, as such most of our economy is reliant on farming and mining."
