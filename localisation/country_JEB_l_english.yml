 rila.1.t:0 "The Committee's View(s)"
 rila.1.d:0 "placeholder: a representative from Société Justice (Michel supporters club - ps: michel is a representative in the committee, try to insert that in if possible) will ask what should the government be like once the committee ends, the Cocardiers respond by saying that the committee will never end and that it is permanent since it is the most democratic thing it can be, Club Patriote (extremist too) will proceed to say that it has to end one day since Rila needs a strong executive president, the two extremist clubs (Cocardier and Patriote) will start a heated argument against eachother, which has never happened before on account of their similar ideology, shocking all the representatives, end the event with two representatives from both Cocardiers and Patriote approaching eachother on the speaking ground"
 rila.1.a:0 "How is this happening?"
 rila.2.t:0 "How to Not Debate"
 rila.2.d:0 "placeholder: direct follow-up to the event above: Cocardier guy and Patriote guy jumps at eachother and fights eachother in the middle of the speaking ground, both Cocardiers and Patriote members start fighting eachother in the committee, some members of the committee quickly rushes to the exit while others from the extremist and moderate socialist clubs join the brawl"
 rila.2.a:0 "Are you trying to ruin the Revolution?!"
 rila.3.t:0 "Committee Brawl Goes Viral"
 rila.3.d:0 "placeholder: this event fires 3 hours after the one above: club members from the Verbe Vrai (aka Progressives print owners and newspapers men) print and talk about the brawl in order to discredit the extremists, population is shocked and there's a loss of faith in the extremists for a few, severe talks about how griffons believe that this might make the revolution fail, heated arguments between griffons in the streets, even a few brawls concerning politics in bars, cafés and other places (this part is very important)"
 rila.3.a:0 "Absolute morons!"
 
 ### ideas ###
 JEB_revolutionary_nexus:0 "Revolutionary Nexus"
 JEB_revolutionary_nexus_desc:0 "During the Revolution of 980, Rila became one of the first places to declare open insurrection against the monarchy.\n\nHome to one of the most fervent revolutionary fervor in the entire Kingdom, it only made sense that the city would become a nexus of revolutionary activity; many revolutionary cells inside the Discret realms originally took root in Rila, making it their first ever place of refuge before expanding their network outside the city."

 ### leader descriptions ###
 committee_of_public_safety_desc:0 "The Committee of Public Safety, originally founded in 979 by several radical and moderate clubs as a local political council supposed to guide the Aquileian revolution, was the main governing body of what used to be the Rilan Revolutionary Front before its eventual downfall at the hands of both internal unrest, and the royalists; badly beaten and humiliated, those revolutionaries that managed to flee the royalist reign of terror eventually went into hiding and scattered themselves in the countryside, but those rare few that stayed behind to uphold the legacy of the Rilan Revolutionary spirit eventually managed to regroup and reform the committee as an underground, clandestine group.\n\nThanks to the efforts of the more resourceful members of this group, the Committee has managed to reorganize itself and even set up a secret assembly in the mansion of a noble who has republican leanings, with its policies and activities spearheaded by the radical enragés known as the Cocardiers, the newly reformed Committee of Public Safety quickly attracted many political activists hailing from all types of backgrounds.\n\nHowever, the Committee still includes many of the problems that previously plagued it during the Revolution, such as intense disagreements between the more radical and progressive clubs of the Committee."
