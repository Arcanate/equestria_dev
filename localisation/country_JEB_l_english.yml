#descriptions
committee_of_public_safety_desc:0 "The Committee of Public Safety was the main governing body of what used to the Rilan Revolutionary Front before its eventual downfall, thanks to the efforts of the more resourceful members of this body, the Committee has managed to reorganize itself and even set up a secret assembly in the mansion of a noble with Republican leanings.\n\nHowever, the Committee still includes many of the problems that previously plagued it during the Revolution, such as intense disagreements and debates between the Enragés and Progressives."
