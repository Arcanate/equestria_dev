  pomovarra.1.t:0 "The Pomovarran Resistance"
  pomovarra.1.d:0 "The group known as the Harz Poumovareg or Résistance Pomovarrane (Pomovarran Resistance) has seen their power grow over the past decades. Initially a minor organization that posed no threat to the Garrison's power, they have become increasingly influential on Pomovarra, especially after the collapse of the Griffonian Empire. Led by the infamous Horman de Camris and Olivier Mordranelle, they have terrorized the Garrison for countless years.\n\nThere have been news that they are planning something, although the Garrison is not sure what."

  pomovarra.2.t:0 "Arguments Within the Garrison"
  pomovarra.2.d:0 "Yesterday, much shouting could be heard from the base of the Pomovarra Garrison. It seems that the leadership of the Garrison have had a major argument, leading to one of them being thrown out and the argument lasting until far past midnight. Commander Johann Heinrich von Griffenheim has not said much about it, but the leadership of the Garrison have been visibly avoiding each other for the past day."

Bringing with him some of his best lieutenants, the next week will be a hard one for the Garrison soldiers. If the Commander deems the conditions too bad, the soldiers will be put through an 'Intensive Training Month', more commonly known as 'The Month of Hell'. The entire Garrison will have to be on their best behavior to survive the week of inspection."

  pomovarra.4.t:0 "The Inspection Finishes"
  pomovarra.4.d:0 "The annual inspection of the Pomovarra Garrison has finished, and the Garrison soldiers have passed. Commander von Griffenheim was 'incredibly pleased' with the current state of the Garrison, and expected them to improve even more for the 1008 inspection. A collective sigh of relief was heard amongst the soldiers of the Garrison as von Griffenheim announced the results - they had been waiting for it the entire week, and the prospect of going through Hell Month was something everyone wanted to avoid."
