  ### Notes for Horseworders ###

  # Hi. Roniius here, the Pomovarra guy. If you're reading this, you're either a horseworder,
  # a member of the team, or some guy who just wanted to take a look at the loc for Pomovarra.
  # In all cases, welcome - however, these are some notes below for Horseworders and myself
  # in an effort to make personalities and lore consistent in the localization of POM.

  # Personalities #

  # Johann Heinrich von Griffenheim - starting garrison commander, is a rather stern, Military
  # man, with a Prussian-style personality to him.

  # Roparzh Frégnel - von Griffenheim's 'right hand man', a local from Pomovarra. He has risen
  # his way up the ranks of the garrison, but he does harbor some sympathies for the resistance.
  # In essence, his path is like T.E. Lawrence's in Kaiserreich.

  # Pietje Meijners - From coastal Griffonia, this lieutenant and possible commander hails From
  # the Griffonian coast. He is a military reformist, and really likes to party and do whatever
  # he wants.

  # Rupprecht von Middenheim-Schubart - Another Prussian-style military man, von Middenheim-Schubart
  # is an Imperial loyalist and Old Guard. He is perhaps the most conservative of all the possible
  # commanders, and wishes to see Pomovarra as a part of the Empire again.

  # Harmann Camriz (Horman de Camris) - A noble, now stripped of his titles, de Camris is one of the
  # main leaders of the Resistance. He is no fighter, but he is a charismatic griffon, pushing forth
  # his ideology of Harmony and Democracy.

  # Olivier Morel - Growing up a street urchin in the city of Pomovarra, Morel has fought his entire
  # life. He is a staunch Pomovarran nationalist and one of the leaders of the Resistance, and wishes
  # to see Pomovarra liberated from the Imperials under a Nationalist government.

  pomovarra.1.t:0 "The Pomovarran Resistance"
  pomovarra.1.d:0 "The group known as the Harz Poumovareg or Résistance Pomovarrane (Pomovarran Resistance) has seen their power grow over the past decades. Initially a minor organization that posed no threat to the Garrison's power, they have become increasingly influential on Pomovarra, especially after the collapse of the Griffonian Empire. Led by the infamous Horman de Camris and Olivier Mordranelle, they have terrorized the Garrison for countless years.\n\nThere have been news that they are planning something, although the Garrison is not sure what."
  pomovarra.1.a:0 "We must be cautious."

  pomovarra.2.t:0 "Arguments Within the Garrison"
  pomovarra.2.d:0 "Yesterday, much shouting could be heard from the base of the Pomovarra Garrison. It seems that the leadership of the Garrison have had a major argument, leading to one of them being thrown out and the argument lasting until far past midnight. Commander Johann Heinrich von Griffenheim has not said much about it, but the leadership of the Garrison have been visibly avoiding each other for the past day."
  pomovarra.2.a:0 "What could this have been about?"

  pomovarra.3.t:0 "Annual Garrison Inspection"
  pomovarra.3.d:0 "The time has come once again for commander Johann Heinrich von Griffenheim to inspect the Garrison. Bringing with him some of his best lieutenants, the next week will be a hard one for the Garrison soldiers. If the Commander deems the conditions too bad, the soldiers will be put through an 'Intensive Training Month', more commonly known as 'The Month of Hell'. The entire Garrison will have to be on their best behavior to survive the week of inspection."
  pomovarra.3.a:0 "Let's hope von Griffenheim is pleased this time."

  pomovarra.4.t:0 "The Inspection Finishes"
  pomovarra.4.d:0 "The annual inspection of the Pomovarra Garrison has finished, and the Garrison soldiers have passed. Commander von Griffenheim was 'incredibly pleased' with the current state of the Garrison, and expected them to improve even more for the 1008 inspection. A collective sigh of relief was heard amongst the soldiers of the Garrison as von Griffenheim announced the results - they had been waiting for it the entire week, and the prospect of going through Hell Month was something everyone wanted to avoid."
  pomovarra.4.a:0 "Sehr gut!"
