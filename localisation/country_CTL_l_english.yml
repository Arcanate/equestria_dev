 ### FOCUS ###
 CTL_the_1_year_plan:0 "The Yaril Speaks"
 CTL_the_1_year_plan_desc:0 "The Chitali season of the early dew has begun, and with it, the Yaril must give an address opening the season, promising boons for the great farmers and aristans of Chital and a restoration of fractured nation's unity and pride. With the current political situation, however, his words might matter more than ever before."

 CTL_call_up_the_nobles:0 "A Meeting With The Three"
 CTL_call_up_the_nobles_desc:0 "Benjen has a year to fix the problems facing Chital by the next Hemanta season - clearly he cannot let the Axis of Chital levy their influence over the Council of Seven at any point in that time. To rectify the issue of Axis influence in the Council, Benjen shall call a meeting for only three of his most trusted advisors, so that he shall only listen to sound policy and rhetoric."

 CTL_deal_with_dannya_shah:0 "Dealing With Dannya Shah"
 CTL_deal_with_dannya_shah_desc:0 "Under the leadership of revolutionary firebrand Dannya Shah, the Chitali People's Liberation Front and its communist allies have continued to grow in power. If we are to quash the growing support for this new ideology of chaos and destruction, we must first send a message to those who would be foolish enough to support them - strating with ending the revolutionary agitation of Dannya Shah."

 ### IDEAS ###
 CTL_native_resistance:0 "Olenian-Hindian Tensions"
 CTL_native_resistance_desc:0 "With support for radical movements exacerbated by the modern movements for harmony, natural rights, and independence throughout the world, the native Chitalis have grown discontent with the current government of Benjen V and the Council of Seven. Many of the natives have begun a policy of complete opposition to the Oleno-Hindian native landed elite, who they believe do not truly represent the people of Chital. If the goverment does not deal with these newfound native tensions quickly, then it could have a crisis on its hooves. With growing support for the Hindian nobility faction in the Council of Seven, the Axis of Chital, along with an increase in militant leftist and republican activity, often sponsored by these same nobles, it is imperative that our government restore balance to Chital, before the Yarildom is swept away by internal turmoil."
 CTL_axis_of_chital:0 "The Axis Of Chital"
 CTL_axis_of_chital_desc:0 "The Axis of Chital consist of three minor nobles in the South of Chital - Hira Ramachan, the scheming lady, Bhushan "the Brash", a famed populist and warrior, and Ivar Hoversholm, a disgraced former ally of Benjen V. Committed to anti-government politics and a desire to change Chital for the better, the Axis supports strengthening Hindian positions and fixing the disparity in power between the landed Oleno-Hindian elite and the commondeer. Given seats on the Council of Seven during the first years of Benjen's reign, the Axis has continued to be a thorn in the monarchy's side, even supporting republican movements at points to sabotage the rule of House Kudlinin. If we ever are to reform Chital, we must first deal with these pompous "champions of the people"."
 CTL_axis_of_chital_remnants:0 "Axis Of Chital Remnants"
 CTL_axis_of_chital_remnants_desc:0 ""
 #CTL_reluctant_king:0 "The Kind Viking" #I will rework this into a leader desc
 #CTL_reluctant_king_desc:0 "Hindian revolutionary Dannya Shah once referred to Benjen V as being "a doe in a buck's body". While that criticism perhaps is a bit outlandish, it is one of the predominant opinions surrounding the new Yaril's reign and lifestyle.\n\nBenjen V was never a warrior like the Oleno-Hindian lords of Eastern Zebrica were expected to be - a steward by heart, he is distrusted by much of the old warrior class of the nation, and especially his Hindian native rivals. However, the Yaril does have one ability that has helped to heal his current situation - kind and open, he has gathered significant praise from many of the nobility who desire a change in pace from the ancient customs of war and tradition, although, to his dissapointment, the Hindians, who one would expect to oppose the old customs, have not rallied behind him either."
 CTL_inland_neglect:0 "Inland Neglect"
 CTL_inland_neglect_desc:0 "It is no secret the allies of Benjen V care much more about the grand coastline of Chital than they do about the inland. Unfortunately, the fact that the inland is the home of many of the country's Hindian elements has increased unrest against the government and set back our development plans for the region. If we are to truly heal our relationship with the inland Hindians, we should first focus on developing their lands back to modern standards. Who knows - it might even improve our economy in the process."

 ### DECISIONS ###
 CTL_wild_world_of_politics:0 "Courtly Intrigue"
 CTL_wild_world_of_politics_desc:0 "In 1003, Benjen V Kudlinin formed the Council of Seven to dispel tensions between the Oleno-Hindians and the Hindian natives. Now, despite his actions, tensions are highter than ever, and the Council, along with the nobility under it, has fragmented into groups.\n\nOn the side supporting Benjen V lies Eva Pillai, Benjen Davirtannen, and Jakub the Grey, §Ceach with their own motivations§! for the Yaril's new government.\n\nAgainst him, lies the Axis of Chital. If the Axis of Chital reaches §Yover 50% support§! or §Rover 50% tension§!, there will be §Rdire consequences§! for the Kind Viking.\n\n§GEva Pillai's§! influence is currently §Y[?CTL_eva_influence]%§!.\n\n§CBenjen Davirtannen's§! influence is currently §Y[?CTL_davirt_influence]%§!.\n\n§gJakub the Grey's§! influence is currently §Y[?CTL_jakub_influence]%§!.\n\n§RThe Axis of Chital's§! influence is currently §Y[?CTL_axis_influence]%§!, and their tension toward the government is currently §R[?CTL_axis_anger]%§!."
 CTL_concessions_to_the_cplf:0 "§YCommunist Re-Alignment§! - Concessions For Loyalty"
 CTL_concessions_to_the_cplf_desc:0 "Eva Pillai has suggested granting concessions the communists willing to return to the fold of the government. Although this might put a strain on our budget, it is sure to be an important turning point in the struggle against the CPLF."
 CTL_sway_them_to_the_reformist_cause:0 "§YCommunist Re-Alignment§! - Sway Them To Democracy"
 CTL_sway_them_to_the_reformist_cause_desc:0 "These communists and our reformists are not so different, after all, suggests Benjen Davirtannen. If we could reform them into good citizens of a democratic Chital, then the king's reformist agenda would surely be bolstered."
 CTL_crush_them_from_the_inside:0 "§YCommunist Re-Alignment§! - Crush Them From Inside"
 CTL_crush_them_from_the_inside_desc:0 "There is no redemption for the CPLF in Jakub the Grey's eyes. Now that we have attracted portions of the CPLF to return to our rule, it is time to finally crush them, and destroy whatever remains of their movement."
 CTL_favor_eva:0 "§YAdvisor Attraction§! - Favor Eva's Pragmatists"
 CTL_favor_eva_dec:0 "Eva Pillai's pragmatic, cosmpolitan faction of the nation is surely necessary for unity between the Axis and the powerful nobility. We must favor her faction in hopes that we can shift our government to her ideals."
 CTL_favor_davirt:0 "§YAdvisor Attraction§! - Favor Davirtannen's Reformists"
 CTL_favor_davirt_dec:0 "Benjen Davirtannen's democratic, almost harmonic faction of the nation, backed by the common Oleno-Hindian deer and the Jarl himself, is truly the faction that should suit the needs of the Chitali people the best."
 CTL_favor_jakub:0 "§YAdvisor Attraction§! - Favor Jakub's Traditionalists"
 CTL_favor_jakub_desc:0 "Jakub the Grey's traditionalist, Oleno-Hindian supremacist faction of the nobility, heavily influenced by the customs of the old Olenian Sea-Kings who first took over Eastern Zebrica
