 ### FOCUS ###
 CTL_the_1_year_plan:0 "The Yaril Speaks"
 CTL_the_1_year_plan_desc:0 "The Chitali season of the early dew has begun, and with it, the Yaril must give an address opening the season, promising boons for the great farmers and aristans of Chital and a restoration of fractured nation's unity and pride. With the current political situation, however, his words might matter more than ever before."

 CTL_call_up_the_nobles:0 "A Meeting With The Three"
 CTL_call_up_the_nobles_desc:0 "Benjen has a year to fix the problems facing Chital by the next Hemanta season - clearly he cannot let the Axis of Chital levy their influence over the Council of Seven at any point in that time. To rectify the issue of Axis influence in the Council, Benjen shall call a meeting for only three of his most trusted advisors, so that he shall only listen to sound policy and rhetoric."

 CTL_deal_with_dannya_shah:0 "Dealing With Dannya Shah"
 CTL_deal_with_dannya_shah_desc:0 "Under the leadership of revolutionary firebrand Dannya Shah, the Chitali People's Liberation Front and its communist allies have continued to grow in power. If we are to quash the growing support for this new ideology of chaos and destruction, we must first send a message to those who would be foolish enough to support them - starting with ending the revolutionary agitation of Dannya Shah."

 CTL_seer_issue:0 "A Summit With The Seers"
 CTL_seer_issue_desc:0 "Traditional Olenian seers still hold positions of high importance at the court of the Yaril, but their presence has been a subject of debate for a long time now. Their influence is upsetting to our native subjects, and their close ties to Yakub the Grey's traditionalist faction worries many of the minor nobility, who fear their power will be threatened. It is finally time to decide once and for all the role of these holy deer."

 CTL_sikh_issue:0 "Dealing With The Tuymaiyānatu"
 CTL_sikh_issue_desc:0 "For hundreds of years, a native religious sect known as the "Tuya" has existed on the political fringe of Chital. In these trying times, the Tuya's charitable actions, as well as its militant defiance of our regime, has attracted new members. Most dangerously, Bhushan the Brash himself, is an adherent. We must address what to do about this movement and fast." 

 CTL_the_fate_of_the_council:0 "Dealing With The Council"
 CTL_the_fate_of_the_council_desc:0 "The Council of Seven was created to calm the concerns of the native nobility, but its successes have been mixed. While it has improved native conditions over the years of its existence, many have come to realize it exists just to support the Yaril's power, causing them to lose their faith in its authority. And now, with factionalism taking hold, Benjen needs to make tough choices regarding its future."
 
 CTL_choosing_an_advisor:0 "Favoring A Faction"
 CTL_choosing_an_advisor_desc:0 "The three factions of the Council each hold significant power throughout Chital. The Jarl possesses his own ambitions of reform and reconstruction, but he may yet be swayed by one of the powerful nobles that sit on the council. The future of Chital shall be decided in these negotiation halls and secretive conversations."

And now, when the rebels have access to explosives and canons, our logistics have been thrown into disarray. We must establish a continuous supply line to the southern territories so that we can put down this rebellion."

 CTL_pacify_the_south:0 "Ending The CPLF"
 CTL_pacify_the_south_desc:0 "Loyal military units have tracked down the CPLF's final holdout in the southern hills, and we are ready to finally put an end to this. The Yaril, in accordance with tradition, shall lead his forces personally to battle against the rebels. Chital shall be free of them once and for all!"

 CTL_infiltrate_her_entourage:0 "Infiltrate Her Entourage"
 CTL_infiltrate_her_entourage_desc:0 "Many within the CPLF are not true communists, or even truly dedicated to the overthrow of the Yaril, they are discontent and impoverished deer who may yet be brought back to reason with a little convincing. Royal operatives will be dispatched to infiltrate the CPLF and encourage disunity amongst its ranks, how we go about this though may differ..."

 CTL_the_fate_of_the_ringleaders:0 "An Axis Connection"
 CTL_the_fate_of_the_ringleaders_desc:0 "Dannya Shah always seems to be one step ahead of us, and always has a few more guns then we could have accounted for, these discrepancies in planning and logistics have begun to raise eyebrows at the royal court. A letter found in a spice field, bearing Dannya's seal may give us some answers, though we may find ourselves dealing with something larger than the CPLF."

 CTL_taking_back_the_spice:0 "Reclaim The Spices"
 CTL_taking_back_the_spice_desc:0 "The Spice plantations of inland Chital have always been a source of revenue for whoever controls them. In present, they lie in the hands of the southern rebels who use them to secure funds and arms for their efforts. Reclaiming these plantations would secure our regime much-needed funds for the continued conflict."

###HIRA RAMACHAN PATH###
 CTL_ramachan_takes_control:0 "The Spymistress In Control"
 CTL_ramachan_takes_control_desc:0 "The unassuming leader of the Axis of Chital, Madame Hira Ramachan, has taken control of the Yarildom following the disbanding of the Council of Seven. With her goals of a broad populist agenda and a centralization of political power for the natives and her allies, Hira will surely not allow the traitors who have driven Chital into the ground to go unpunished."

 CTL_puppet_jarl:0 "A Puppet Yaril"
 CTL_puppet_jarl_desc:0 "Brienna Kudlinen, the Yaril's cousin and younger sister of Jakub the Grey, has never been active in Chitali politics, and after Jakub and Benjen's removal from the political scene, is technically the heir to the Yarildom. To truly stabilize our government, we must bring a Yaril back to Chital, and Brienna is just the right doe for the job."

 CTL_a_few_loose_ends:0 "A Few Loose Ends"
 CTL_a_few_loose_ends_desc:0 "There are some members of the Chitali nobility that are beyond redemption. Supporters of a traditional Olenian aristocracy have continued to oppose our government, and if they ever took control of Chital again, would surely enslave the Hindians once more. If we wish to ensure the stability of the Ramachan government, these traditionalists must be purged."

 CTL_exile_the_heir:0 "Exile The Grey Viking"
 CTL_exile_the_heir_desc:0 "A vicious enforcer of the whims of the Yaril and his predecessors, Jakub the Grey has left a trail of Hindian blood in his wake. While we surely admire his military prowess, there is no need for him to remain in government any longer, as he has shown himself to only be loyal to the Yaril and his own authority. He must be exiled, as he has most certainly overstayed his welcome."

 CTL_send_out_their_secrets:0 "Selling Secrets"
 CTL_send_out_their_secrets_desc:0 "As the court's de-facto Spymistress for years, Hira Ramachan has developed a certain wealth of information pertaining to the hidden desires and controversial political motives of her previous higher-ups. With the people still skeptical of Madame Hira's newfound position of power, perhaps it is the perfect time to reveal the pleasures, deadly intrigue, and corruption of the Chitali nobility."

 CTL_factionalize_the_crown_loyalists:0 "Split The Resistance"
 CTL_factionalize_the_crown_loyalists_desc:0 "The resistance to the Axis of Chital is prone to ideological squabbling of their own, especially the traditonalists and the reformists, who, even with completely different philosophies, have united against Madame Hira and the Axis. Our efforts must be furthered to factionalize the resistance, so that it pains Jakub the Grey and Benjen Davirtannen to even look at eachother."

 CTL_bhushan_as_deputy:0 "Appoint Bhushan As Deputy"
 CTL_bhushan_as_deputy_desc:0 "Bhushan Gurat has served as Ramachan's greatest ally in the government and in the Axis for years. Lord Ivar may be a dignified figurehead for some deer, but Bhushan is the epitome of the spirit of the people of Chital. A protector of the native culture and way of life and staunch agrarian populist, Bhushan is what Chital needs as its deputy, not more prancing nobles with minds only for themselves."

 CTL_work_with_hoversholm:0 "Work With Lord Ivar"
 CTL_work_with_hoversholm_desc:0 "Bhushan Gurat's position in government is a complicated situation, but one thing remains clear - that he is not the correct candidate to serve as Hira's right hand deer, especially because of his radical ideology. Ivar Hoversholm, although not a particularly inspiring personality, is a comptent administrator and good friend to Madame Hira, and so shall take Bhushan's place as unofficial second-in-command."

It has only served to strengthen the authority of Yaril Benjen and his puppets, all the while maintaing a farce of democratic governance in Chital. The Council of Seven must be abolished, if we are to truly cement the Axis and bring an end to the Yaril's lies."

 CTL_democratic_pretenses:0 "Just And Democratic Pretenses"
 CTL_democratic_pretenses_desc:0 "Hira and the Axis gained power on promises of populism and anti-elitism, and for that reason, it is clear that the Council of Seven and the oligarchic values it represented would be better left in the past. A Chitali Assmebly, with elected representatives from across Hindia, would be a better advisory legislature to Brienna I and Madame Hira than any undemocratic privy council could ever be."

However, Chital is a deeply religious nation, and simply declaring the nation a secular state would inspire mass resistance. Knowing that, we shall use religion as a tool to encourage unity and comradery between all free Hindians of Chital, even if we have to edit some funamental tenets."

 ### IDEAS ###
 CTL_native_resistance:0 "Olenian-Hindian Tensions"
 CTL_native_resistance_desc:0 "With support for radical movements exacerbated by the modern movements for harmony, natural rights, and independence throughout the world, the native Chitalis have grown discontent with the current government of Benjen V and the Council of Seven. Many of the natives have begun a policy of complete opposition to the Oleno-Hindian native landed elite, who they believe do not truly represent the people of Chital. If the goverment does not deal with these newfound native tensions quickly, then it could have a crisis on its hooves. With growing support for the Hindian nobility faction in the Council of Seven, the Axis of Chital, along with an increase in militant leftist and republican activity, often sponsored by these same nobles, it is imperative that our government restore balance to Chital, before the Yarildom is swept away by internal turmoil."
 CTL_axis_of_chital:0 "The Axis Of Chital"
 CTL_axis_of_chital_desc:0 "The Axis of Chital consist of three minor nobles in the South of Chital - Hira Ramachan, the scheming lady, Bhushan "the Brash", a famed populist and warrior, and Ivar Hoversholm, a disgraced former ally of Benjen V. Committed to anti-government politics and a desire to change Chital for the better, the Axis supports strengthening Hindian positions and fixing the disparity in power between the landed Oleno-Hindian elite and the commondeer. Given seats on the Council of Seven during the first years of Benjen's reign, the Axis has continued to be a thorn in the monarchy's side, even supporting republican movements at points to sabotage the rule of House Kudlinin. If we ever are to reform Chital, we must first deal with these pompous "champions of the people"."

 #CTL_reluctant_king_desc:0 "Hindian revolutionary Dannya Shah once referred to Benjen V as being "a doe in a buck's body". While that criticism perhaps is a bit outlandish, it is one of the predominant opinions surrounding the new Yaril's reign and lifestyle.\n\nBenjen V was never a warrior like the Oleno-Hindian lords of Eastern Zebrica were expected to be - a steward by heart, he is distrusted by much of the old warrior class of the nation, and especially his Hindian native rivals. However, the Yaril does have one ability that has helped to heal his current situation - kind and open, he has gathered significant praise from many of the nobility who desire a change in pace from the ancient customs of war and tradition, although, to his dissapointment, the Hindians, who one would expect to oppose the old customs, have not rallied behind him either."
 CTL_inland_neglect:0 "Inland Neglect"
 CTL_inland_neglect_desc:0 "It is no secret the allies of Benjen V care much more about the grand coastline of Chital than they do about the inland. Unfortunately, the fact that the inland is the home of many of the country's Hindian elements has increased unrest against the government and set back our development plans for the region. If we are to truly heal our relationship with the inland Hindians, we should first focus on developing their lands back to modern standards. Who knows - it might even improve our economy in the process."

chital.28.d:0 "The efforts of Madame Hira to finally syncretize Mahimatism and the associated religions and worships of the Seers of old Olenia have culminated in a great conference at Montaba, with the goal of finally putting the religious divides of Chital to rest.\n\nThe main advisor at Court serving the Seers was Konor, a staunch follower of Ukko and opponent to what he calls "the primitive pagan rituals of a bygone era". For the past weeks, he has continued to badger Ramachan over her reluctancy to enshrine the Seers as the official leaders of Chitali religious life, declaring that the Yarildom's devotion to the traditional values of Olenian religious culture must come first, before any populist promises or democratic reforms.\n\n"If we give the Mahimatists and their backwards, destructive ideology any more power, they will eradicate the entire vision of the seers as we know it, and make this country some kind of primitivist mother cult devoted to the destruction of all of the gains the Yaril's government has made in the past few years," Konor had angrily said during the conference, slamming his hoof upon the table, "The Tuya are terrorists, and the Mahimatists have allowed them to operate, cleansing the countryside of all opposition to the Yaril! What Chital needs is tradition, glory, and to be ruled by the Olenians and their Gods again. If any syncretism must be done, I say, Mahimata shall only reign as a goddess within the pantheon, and among equals."\n\nKonor's doctrine of the supremacy of the Olenian temples, however, have been challenged by others at the court, especially Bhushan Gurat, a member of the Axis of Chital and close friend to Hira Ramachan. Bhushan, a member of the Tuymaiyānatu religious militia and staunch devotee of the Hindian religion, has proposed that if the religions are ever unified, Mahimata should rank above the other gods as a mother figure in accordance with core Mahimatist monotheistic principles.\n\n"Konor is incorrect, clearly, and continues to spew his propaganda about Mahimatist principles and Mahimata as a goddess," Bhushan declared, "Mahimata is the mother of all Hindians, and the Olenians would only like to see us return to the corrupt modernism of the vapid Olenian temple system. They would have us destroy our lands, end our traditional structures, and eradicate our own culture so that we can return to some kind of "sound" governance." "His ideology is as foolish as it is harmful," Bhushan continued, "And I implore Hira, above all, to enshrine Mahimata as the official head of the pantheon and goddess of Chital.""

 ### TRAITS AND DESCS ###
 benjen_desc:0 "Benjen V was never a warrior like the old Sea-Kings of the continent, raiders who ravaged the Eastern seaboard of Zebrica and subjugated the native deer under their rule from Sambar to Doehli. Now, many of the old Oleno-Hindian monarchies have fallen to native unrest and rebellion, but not Chital, where the Kudinins of Hovenhamn have continued to rule uninterrupted for centuries.\n\nBenjen Kudlinen, trained in the art of stewardship, was crowned Yaril of Chital in 1001, following the death of his brother, Yaril Kristoff III, at the hands of radical native militias in the South. Although he managed unrest competently for the next few years, Benjen V Kudlinen was called "The Kind Viking" by the traditionalists for his lack of military expertise and stewardly disposition, creating a rift between the heirs of the Vikings and this new, reformist Yaril.\n\nIn 1003, Benjen formed the Counci of Seven, meant to heal tensions between the Hindians and the settler Oleno-Hindians, but inevitably, the council fell into factionalism and decay, with the three anti-Yaril lords soon forming the Axis of Chital in 1004. Although the Kind Viking, gregarious and friendly with the rest of the nobility, attempted to mend the struggles between the two factions, he has continued to fail.\n\nIf he does not deal with these issues, soon, the Kind Viking will perhaps be known only as the Yaril who doomed House Kudlinen forever."
