 ### FOCUS ###
 CTL_the_1_year_plan:0 "The Yaril Speaks"
 CTL_the_1_year_plan_desc:0 "The Chitali season of the early dew has begun, and with it, the Yaril must give an address opening the season, promising boons for the great farmers and aristans of Chital and a restoration of fractured nation's unity and pride. With the current political situation, however, his words might matter more than ever before."

 CTL_call_up_the_nobles:0 "A Meeting With The Three"
 CTL_call_up_the_nobles_desc:0 "Benjen has a year to fix the problems facing Chital by the next Hemanta season - clearly he cannot let the Axis of Chital levy their influence over the Council of Seven at any point in that time. To rectify the issue of Axis influence in the Council, Benjen shall call a meeting for only three of his most trusted advisors, so that he shall only listen to sound policy and rhetoric."

 CTL_deal_with_dannya_shah:0 "Dealing With Dannya Shah"
 CTL_deal_with_dannya_shah_desc:0 "Under the leadership of revolutionary firebrand Dannya Shah, the Chitali People's Liberation Front and its communist allies have continued to grow in power. If we are to quash the growing support for this new ideology of chaos and destruction, we must first send a message to those who would be foolish enough to support them - starting with ending the revolutionary agitation of Dannya Shah."

 CTL_seer_issue:0 "A Summit With The Seers"
 CTL_seer_issue_desc:0 "Traditional Olenian seers still hold positions of high importance at the court of the Yaril, but their presence has been a subject of debate for a long time now. Their influence is upsetting to our native subjects, and their close ties to Yakub the Grey's traditionalist faction worries many of the minor nobility, who fear their power will be threatened. It is finally time to decide once and for all the role of these holy deer."

 CTL_sikh_issue:0 "Dealing With The Tuymaiyānatu"
 CTL_sikh_issue_desc:0 "For hundreds of years, the religious sect "Mahimatism" has existed on the societal fringe, ever-present but never influential. But in these trying times, the syncretic Mahimati faith has attracted new adherents, and its religious militia the "Tuymaiyānatu" or the "Tuya" has grown as well. Most dangerously, Bhushan the Brash himself, is an adherent. We must address what to do about this movement and fast."

 CTL_the_fate_of_the_council:0 "Dealing With The Council"
 CTL_the_fate_of_the_council_desc:0 "The Council of Seven was created to calm the concerns of the native nobility, but its successes have been mixed. While it has improved native conditions over the years of its existence, many have come to realize it exists just to support the Yaril's power, causing them to lose their faith in its authority. And now, with factionalism taking hold, Benjen needs to make tough choices regarding its future."
 
 CTL_choosing_an_advisor:0 "Favoring A Faction"
 CTL_choosing_an_advisor_desc:0 "The three factions of the Council each hold significant power throughout Chital. The Jarl possesses his own ambitions of reform and reconstruction, but he may yet be swayed by one of the powerful nobles that sit on the council. The future of Chital shall be decided in these negotiation halls and secretive conversations."

We must establish a continuous supply line to the southern territories so that we can put down this rebellion."

 CTL_taking_back_the_spice:0 "Reclaim The Spices"
 CTL_taking_back_the_spice_desc:0 "The Spice plantations of inland Chital have always been a source of revenue for whoever controls them. In present, they lie in the hands of the southern rebels who use them to secure funds and arms for their efforts.

 ### IDEAS ###
 CTL_native_resistance:0 "Olenian-Hindian Tensions"
 CTL_native_resistance_desc:0 "With support for radical movements exacerbated by the modern movements for harmony, natural rights, and independence throughout the world, the native Chitalis have grown discontent with the current government of Benjen V and the Council of Seven. Many of the natives have begun a policy of complete opposition to the Oleno-Hindian native landed elite, who they believe do not truly represent the people of Chital. If the goverment does not deal with these newfound native tensions quickly, then it could have a crisis on its hooves. With growing support for the Hindian nobility faction in the Council of Seven, the Axis of Chital, along with an increase in militant leftist and republican activity, often sponsored by these same nobles, it is imperative that our government restore balance to Chital, before the Yarildom is swept away by internal turmoil."
 CTL_axis_of_chital:0 "The Axis Of Chital"
 CTL_axis_of_chital_desc:0 "The Axis of Chital consist of three minor nobles in the South of Chital - Hira Ramachan, the scheming lady, Bhushan "the Brash", a famed populist and warrior, and Ivar Hoversholm, a disgraced former ally of Benjen V. Committed to anti-government politics and a desire to change Chital for the better, the Axis supports strengthening Hindian positions and fixing the disparity in power between the landed Oleno-Hindian elite and the commondeer. Given seats on the Council of Seven during the first years of Benjen's reign, the Axis has continued to be a thorn in the monarchy's side, even supporting republican movements at points to sabotage the rule of House Kudlinin. If we ever are to reform Chital, we must first deal with these pompous "champions of the people"."

 #CTL_reluctant_king:0 "The Kind Viking" #I will rework this into a leader desc
 #CTL_reluctant_king_desc:0 "Hindian revolutionary Dannya Shah once referred to Benjen V as being "a doe in a buck's body". While that criticism perhaps is a bit outlandish, it is one of the predominant opinions surrounding the new Yaril's reign and lifestyle.\n\nBenjen V was never a warrior like the Oleno-Hindian lords of Eastern Zebrica were expected to be - a steward by heart, he is distrusted by much of the old warrior class of the nation, and especially his Hindian native rivals. However, the Yaril does have one ability that has helped to heal his current situation - kind and open, he has gathered significant praise from many of the nobility who desire a change in pace from the ancient customs of war and tradition, although, to his dissapointment, the Hindians, who one would expect to oppose the old customs, have not rallied behind him either."
 CTL_inland_neglect:0 "Inland Neglect"
 CTL_inland_neglect_desc:0 "It is no secret the allies of Benjen V care much more about the grand coastline of Chital than they do about the inland. Unfortunately, the fact that the inland is the home of many of the country's Hindian elements has increased unrest against the government and set back our development plans for the region. If we are to truly heal our relationship with the inland Hindians, we should first focus on developing their lands back to modern standards. Who knows - it might even improve our economy in the process."

 CTL_wild_world_of_politics_desc:0 "In 1003, Benjen V Kudlinin formed the Council of Seven to dispel tensions between the Oleno-Hindians and the Hindian natives. Now, despite his actions, tensions are highter than ever, and the Council, along with the nobility under it, has fragmented into groups.\n\nOn the side supporting Benjen V lies Eva Pillai, Benjen Davirtannen, and Jakub the Grey, §Ceach with their own motivations§! for the Yaril's new government.\n\nAgainst him, lies the Axis of Chital. If the Axis of Chital reaches §Yover 50% support§! or §Rover 50% tension§!, there will be §Rdire consequences§! for the Kind Viking.\n\n§GEva Pillai's§! influence is currently §Y[?CTL_eva_influence]%§!.\n\n§CBenjen Davirtannen's§! influence is currently §Y[?CTL_davirt_influence]%§!.\n\n§gJakub the Grey's§! influence is currently §Y[?CTL_jakub_influence]%§!.\n\n§RThe Axis of Chital's§! influence is currently §Y[?CTL_axis_influence]%§!, and their tension toward the government is currently §R[?CTL_axis_anger]%§!."

 ### TRAITS AND DESCS ###
 benjen_desc:0 "Benjen V was never a warrior like the old Sea-Kings of the continent, raiders who ravaged the Eastern seaboard of Zebrica and subjugated the native deer under their rule from Sambar to Doehli. Now, many of the old Oleno-Hindian monarchies have fallen to native unrest and rebellion, but not Chital, where the Kudinins of Hovenhamn have continued to rule uninterrupted for centuries.\n\nBenjen Kudlinen, trained in the art of stewardship, was crowned Yaril of Chital in 1001, following the death of his brother, Yaril Kristoff III, at the hands of radical native militias in the South. Although he managed unrest competently for the next few years, Benjen V Kudlinen was called "The Kind Viking" by the traditionalists for his lack of military expertise and stewardly disposition, creating a rift between the heirs of the Vikings and this new, reformist Yaril.\n\nIn 1003, Benjen formed the Counci of Seven, meant to heal tensions between the Hindians and the settler Oleno-Hindians, but inevitably, the council fell into factionalism and decay, with the three anti-Yaril lords soon forming the Axis of Chital in 1004. Although the Kind Viking, gregarious and friendly with the rest of the nobility, attempted to mend the struggles between the two factions, he has continued to fail.\n\nIf he does not deal with these issues, soon, the Kind Viking will perhaps be known only as the Yaril who doomed House Kudlinen forever."
