 #Events
 deponya_advisors.0.t:0 "The Alchemist arrives"
 deponya_advisors.0.d:0 "Stealthy Serpent, also known as The Alchemist, is the newest of the King’s advisors and the most mysterious, with their body, face, and gender hidden behind heavy robes and a massive ornamental mask made of wood from the Eygsic Forest. This forest has been their home and the herbs and resources of these dangerous lands have allowed Stealthy to become a leader in potion-making and medicine throughout the kingdom.\n\nAs a member of the privy council they have constantly called for royal resources to be spent on education, alchemist endeavours, and reforming the Deponian system of governance to be better aligned with the more harmonic nations of the River Federation."
 deponya_advisors.0.a:0 "Their scholarly insight with be greatly appreciated."
 deponya_advisors.1.t:0 "The Prince Arrives"
 deponya_advisors.1.d:0 "Prince Bountiful Harvest is King Grimhoof’s eldest brother. He was passed over for the crown upon his father’s death due to the nobility finding him lacking the Right to Rule. However, the Prince holds no ill will towards his brother and has always been a trusted advisor, providing eight years of dutiful service.\n\nThe Prince is very much a conservative, believing that the old ways are what will lead Deponya through these trying times. He has used his position as advisor to solidify the status quo between the crown and the nobility while also shoring up the nation’s defenses in the face of gryphon aggression."
 deponya_advisors.1.a:0 "One must always trust the advice of family."
 deponya_advisors.2.t:0 "The Knight Arrives"
 deponya_advisors.2.d:0 "Lady Lancetrot, also known as the Knight, is the commander of the Royal Army, holding this position valiantly since well before the reign of King Grimhoof. She believes in chivalry and holds herself to it, occasionally pushing her values to the point of creating conflict between herself and the other members of the privy council. However, her reputation as a decorated war hero, her sense of humour, and the charisma of herself and her page often snubs these blossoming rivalries in the bud.\n\nAs a member of the army, she uses her voice in the council to promote a pro-military agenda, looking to funnel increasing amounts of Grimhoof’s treasury into building up defenses, increasing the scope of the military, and modernizing it, in order to ensure Deponya's security.."
 deponya_advisors.2.a:0 "A hero's welcome is in order."
 deponya_advisors.3.t:0 "The Priestess Arives"
 deponya_advisors.3.d:0 "High Priestess Radiant Glory is new to her post as head of the Deponian church. Yet, in her short tenure she has established a reputation for being warm, inviting, and kind to all she meets, may they be noblestallion or simple farmer. Her beauty is well known across the land and many ponies ache at the thought of one day becoming her suitor, even in the face of her supposed celibacy.\n\nShe has often used her charming personality and close friendship with the King to push for her rather progressive agenda. She wishes to bridge the gap between rich and poor, and stands up firmly for the rights of the peasantry."
 deponya_advisors.3.a:0 "A friend’s advice is always welcome."
 deponya_advisors.4.t_1:0 "Privy Council of 1007"
 deponya_advisors.4.t_2:0 "The Advisor Meeting: Round 2"
 deponya_advisors.4.t_3:0 "The Advisor Meeting: Round 3"
 deponya_advisors.4.t_4:0 "The Advisor Meeting: Round 4"
 deponya_advisors.4.d_1:0 "The King and his Privy Council gathered together at the royal citadel across the river from Buckbanburg. Rather than have their meeting in the openness of the central hall, the five ponies came together in the intimacy of the King’s private chambers, gathering around a large oak table.\n\nThe King has brought them together to discuss the future of Deponya. He explains that he wishes to modernize his domains. He knows such an endeavour would not be easy but asks that his advisors do their duty and help in this mission.\n\nThe first to speak is The Alchemist. They explain that the main issue plaguing Deponya is the rampant illiteracy and the utter lack of highly educated engineers, scientists, potion-makers, and alchemists. He claims that by investing into intellectual infrastructure, the ponies of Deponya can be educated and the nation can begin to address its other issues.\n\nThe Prince laughs at this, claiming that such an investment would also serve in educating the populace in the philosophies of democracy and harmony, utterly ruining the delicate balance of Deponian society. He then puts forward a plan to work with the nobility to better integrate their assets into the royal coffers and use the funds to invest in infrastructure and industry. These two pillars would surely benefit Deponya the most.\n\nThe Knight shakes her head, cracking a joke at the Prince’s expense. The Alchemist and High Priestess join in her laughter, while King Grimhoof cracks a slight smile. The Knight then goes on to demand that more gold be given to the military, lest Deponya fall to griffon raiders.\n\nThe Priestess shakes her head. No, she claims, the gold could be better spent on the poor. A modern nation is one where the entirety of society benefits from their labours and by elevating the poor they can begin to better contribute to society. Her ideas are met by wary glances.\n\nFor hours, debate rages back and forth. Until finally, the King raises a hoof, silencing the room. All eyes are upon him, ready for his decision."

 deponya_advisors.9.a:0 "Great"
 deponya_advisors.10.t:0 "The Potion-Maker’s Guild"
 deponya_advisors.10.d:0 "Within recent years, potion-making has become a rather lucrative business within Deponya, helping to alleviate some of the economic stresses of our declining agricultural exports. The recent rise in potion-making has been spearheaded by a strong demand for our potions amongst the upper-middle classes of our fellow River Federation members who believe that the natural healing properties of our elixirs and brews can trump those of modern medicine.\n\nThis rise has provided bountiful job prospects and a whole new class of amateur, and often dubiously trained, potion-makers. In order to stop their subpar brews from reaching foreign markets, and sink our reputation, King Grimhoof has established a formalized Potion-Maker’s Guild, which will control who can and cannot export potions to foreign markets. This Guild will also be chiefly responsible for conducting research on new and improve potion designs.\n\nThe first act we must take when establishing this guild, is to finance a centralized charter house for them to operate out of. The more we are willing to invest into this facility’s design, construction, equipment procurement, and staffing the better equipped the guild will be for tackling their new mission."
 deponya_advisors.10.a:0 "Give them enough funds to repurpose a merchant's house."

 deponya_spider.0.t:0 "The Depths of the Eygsic"
 deponya_spider.0.d:0 "The Eygsic Forest dominates the northern expanses of Deponya. It is a region of sparse infrastructure, few settlements, and little industry besides for a few lucrative crystal mines and lumber mills. While attempts have been made to penetrate into the forest and subjugate it for the good of the realm, they have often met with failure, with the settlers seemingly besieged and driven off by the very forest itself.\n\nA myth has been born from this hostility, claiming that a wicked queen inhabits the forest, defending her forsaken wilderness from the ‘hostilities’ of civilization. While these are surely just the ramblings of panicked settlers, they have begun to spread through our population. This has not only sowed panic amongst our ponies but has also made it difficult to attract settlers for future ventures into the forests."

 #Nation Focuses
 DEP_Advisors:0 "Privy Council of 1007"
 DEP_Advisors_desc:0 "The Privy Council of Deponya is made up of King Grimhoof and his closest advisors. These few individuals act as the central source of authority for the nation, wielding the bulk of decision-making powers. Within recent years, the council has included Prince Bountiful Harvest, Lady Lancetrot, Stealthy Serpent, and High Priestess Radiant Glory."
 DEP_Alchemist:0 "The Alchemist’s First Tenure"
 DEP_Alchemist_desc:0 "Stealthy Serpent, also known as the Alchemist, is a renown potion-maker and medicine pony. Under their guidance, King Grimhoof has called for a two-pronged approach to handling the nation’s many problems. The first would include reforms that would improve access to education, while the second would see investments made into the lucrative potion-making industry."

 DEP_Alchemist_education_for_foals:0 "Donate to the Chapels"
 DEP_Alchemist_education_for_foals_desc:0 "Chapels are a staple in Deponian villages with their priests often being the only literature individual in the community, meaning that they are often alone in providing education to the local populace. If we were to donate to these chapels, we could provide them with the means of hiring additional staff and aquiring the resources necessary for teaching."
 DEP_Alchemist_history_teaching:0 "Lessons from the Past"
 DEP_Alchemist_history_teaching_desc:0 "In a nation as old and traditional as Deponya, it is surprising how little the average commoner knows about their history and heritage. In order to address this, the King has given permission to Stealthy Serpent to draft a lecture on Deponian history to be presented within chapels, squares, and other public venues."
 DEP_Alchemist_funds_for_poition_training:0 "Establish the Potion-Maker's Guild"
 DEP_Alchemist_funds_for_poition_training_desc:0 "Within recent years, potion-making has become a highly lucrative business within Deponya, with their export growing annually. This is due to increasing consumption by foreign elites who are desperate for natural remedies to their ailments. By creating a formalized guild, with established rules, we can ensure proper regulations, quality control, and secure the reputation of our wares."
 DEP_Alchemist_forest_investment:0 "The Eygsic Charter"
 DEP_Alchemist_forest_investment_desc:0 "Due to the hostile nature of the Eygsic Forest, few industrial enterprises have managed to prosper in the region. However, the Potion-Maker’s Guild has put forth a plan to establish a branch office within the forest and begin extracting the precious herbs needed for their trade. All they require is the consent of the crown and a formal charter to set up operations."
 DEP_Alchemist_national_teaching_class:0 "Establish the Deponian School System"
 DEP_Alchemist_national_teaching_class_desc:0 "While chapel schools have served our nation for generations, the uneven quality and diversity in curriculums has often slowed our nation’s ability to tackle basic literacy. By investing in a crown-run school system, independent of the church, we can ensure a unified curriculum and a basic level of quality in teaching staff."

 DEP_Air_beginig:0 "Onto Bluer Pastures"
 DEP_Air_beginig_desc:0 "For centuries our ponies have looked upon the sky with distant awe. Today will mark the day on which we shall sail fourth on the winds of the future and take what has always been our nation's rightful claim. Today for the first time in our history we shall expand our borders into the heaven's azure."
 DEP_Air_catch_up:0 "Wings of Iron"
 DEP_Air_catch_up_desc:0 "Our Pegasus brethren have served our country dutifully in peacetime and war alike. However even they understand that that the problems of today require new solutions. Solutions which will need not feathers and muscles, but Iron and Blood."
 DEP_Air_bombing:0 "Feast on Famine"
 DEP_Air_bombing_desc:0 "Just as the body cannot survive without proper sustenance, any war machine collapses as soon it's deprived from its ungodly bread of arms and ammunition. Few understand this as well as the ponies of Deponya. But now the time has come for the world to learn that what we give, we can just as easily take away."
 DEP_Air_bombing_research:0 "Size Does Mean Everything"
 DEP_Air_bombing_research_desc:0 "Is it not the prerogative of the greatest country in the world to have the best planes on the planet? And isn't the best planes supposed to have the longest wingspan, fire the heaviest guns and drop the most destructive bombs?"
 DEP_Air_tactical_research:0 "Bluer than the Skies"
 DEP_Air_tactical_research_desc:0 "As our greatness grows so do the challenges we face. Deponya is no longer the landlocked backwards country it was so we must widen our horizons. The wars are no longer fought on the ground and in the land it has become three front affair. And anypony who fails at one inevitably fails at all."
 DEP_Air_tactical:0 "Balance in All Things"
 DEP_Air_tactical_desc:0 "Few would be foolish enough to deny the power of the airforce. Strangely enough however there are many who wilfully ignore half of this power in favour of the other. We are not them. Our power is versatility our victory lies in adopting to our enemy."
 DEP_Air_tactical_fighter:0 "Blotting out the Sun"
 DEP_Air_tactical_fighter_desc:0 "No matter whether we want to use the sky to rain fire and death upon our enemies’ halls or to save our own ponies on the line the first step is control. Total, absolute control. For she who controls the sky, shall controls the land and she who controls the land shall rule them all."
 DEP_Air_fighter:0 "Brethren of Land and Sky"
 DEP_Air_fighter_desc:0 "Our air force, crucial to our war effort as it may have been, still just a mean to win the ground war. For that reason it is imperative to tie our efforts in the air to that of our land army. For once the sky is ruled by our planes the success of our soldiers on the field is all but assured."
 DEP_Air_fighter_research:0 "Stand Together"
 DEP_Air_fighter_research_desc:0 "Gentlecolts our situation is dire. Which is indeed a problem. The more immediate problem is that we're fucked. Now, there is no easy way out. Nor there is a sure one. But I can promise you this: If we are not willing to the absolute most for each other, from brownshoes to blackshoes it's over. We’re all gonna have to be ready to die as one, so that some may live and tell the tale."
 DEP_Air_bombing_idea:0 "Bleed Them Dry"
 DEP_Air_bombing_idea_desc:0 "Foreigners would argue that bombing a well-established hinterland is akin to fight the legendary chimera. For every factory we raze they will raise two anew. Luckily we Deponians know that after you cut off a dozen heads or two, the chimera just bleeds out."
 DEP_Air_tactical_idea:0 "On the Other Hoof"
 DEP_Air_tactical_idea_desc:0 "When you have one choice, you have none. When you have two choices, the best you can hope for is that you'll make only one mistake. Because the versatility of tactical bombing is easy when the bombing operation you organised succeeds and you get promoted. It's only hard when you have to face the thousand widows and orphans whose loved ones you chose not to save on the line."
 DEP_Air_fighter_idea:0 "On the Darkest Night"
 DEP_Air_fighter_idea_desc:0 "When the offensive comes, no trench will be safe, no bunker will give you solace, no tank will come to break their lines, even the magic of mechanised will be sapped. But even when we're dragged through the valley of the shadow of death, we will fear no evil: for they are with us; their guns and bombs comfort us."
 DEP_Air_rocketo:0 "Growing Strong"
 DEP_Air_rocketo_desc:0 "Ponies of Deponya! We all know that even the most majestic tree can grow out from the smallest of seeds. Just like our air force has grown into what it is today from the humblest of beginnings. It is my immeasurable pleasure to announce the newest branch of our air force one that we know is going to be the tallest and greenest of them all."
 DEP_Air_atom:0 "Life Itself."
 DEP_Air_atom_desc:0 "Deponya has always been the cradle of life. From the myriad creatures of the Eygsic forest to the arable plains of Coltanhamm this country exudes life. It is our unique connection to this land that makes us capable of deciding when life went too far for its own good. It is then when our gentle hooves will pluck the weeds that threaten our beautiful garden."
 DEP_Marine_beginig:0 "Legacy of the Six Rivers"
 DEP_Marine_beginig_desc:0 "Deponya is a land of navigable rivers, with a class of skilled ferrystallions, boat builders, and smugglers born to handle these turbulent waterways. With our recent acquisition of coastal lands, it has become vital that we draft these individuals into our newly established Royal Deponyian Navy and pray that some of their skills transfer."
 DEP_Marine_big_dreams:0 "A Mighty Navy"
 DEP_Marine_big_dreams_desc:0 "The battleship is the flagship of a truly noble navy with its thick armour, mighty guns, and sheer terror factor on the water. While these vessels are expensive to make, and their practicality is coming into question with the recent rise of the aircraft carrier, High Admiral Solar Brisk assures his majesty that an investment in them would be worthwhile."
 DEP_Marine_sneaky_dream:0 "A Practical Navy"
 DEP_Marine_sneaky_dream_desc:0 "Deponya is as infant on the open ocean, with our navy having to be built from the ground up. Meanwhile, many of our foes have had access to the sea for generations and have had years to build up an effective fighting force. As such, we shouldn’t squander our meagre resources on frivolous ships but rather spend them wisely on projects that would maximize our limited scope."
 DEP_Marine_flying_dream:0 "A Modern Navy"
 DEP_Marine_flying_dream_desc:0 "The aircraft carrier is the mark of a modern navy, allowing for the projection of naval power over incredible distances. While there are many hurdles for us to overcome in terms of equipment, tactics, and logistics, Minister of the Navy, Midnight Smooch, assure his majesty that such a focus in ship design would assure our hegemony over Eastern Griffonia."
 DEP_Marine_battleships:0 "Acquire Bakarian Designs"
 DEP_Marine_battleships_desc:0 "Of all the River Coalition’s member states, Bakara has the best record with shipbuilding, producing the alliance’s largest fleet with the BNS Bakara as its flagship. The Bakara was an impressive battleship in its prime, dominating the waters off of Eastern Griffonia. While the design has aged, the acquisition of its blueprints would be very helpful in kickstarting our own designs."
 DEP_Marine_light_cruiser:0 "Fund Domestic Designs"
 DEP_Marine_light_cruiser_desc:0 "Our nation can only borrow so much expertise from our allies. At some point we will need to design ships unique to our experiences, geography, and challenges. Already, competent architects and engineers from across our lands have submitted designs for a truly Deponyian ship. The most promising design is for a light cruiser, drafted by famed Buckbanburg Marine Guild."
 DEP_Marine_dockjards:0 "The Royal Deponyian Dockyards"
 DEP_Marine_dockjards_desc:0 "A fleet centred upon the battleship is not a cheap investment to make. If we wish to rule the waves than we must develop the drydocks needed to build and service these mammoth vessels. The first such facility to be constructed, as part of this programme, is the Royal Deponyian Dockyards which will act as the premium facility for Deponyian shipbuilding."
 DEP_Marine_Heavy_batleships:0 "Improve Bakarian Designs"
 DEP_Marine_Heavy_batleships_desc:0 "While the adoption of Bakarian designs have been incredibly beneficial at kickstarting our naval development, we’ve begun to run into a wall in terms of innovation. It is about time to move beyond our Bakarian forefathers and develop a class of battleships which will be unmatched in terms of firepower, armour, and sheer scale."
 DEP_Marine_big_dreams_idea_one:0 "Renovate the Royal Deponyian Dockyards"
 DEP_Marine_big_dreams_idea_one_desc:0 "As a product of our inexperience and unfamiliarity with shipbuilding, the Royal Deponyian Dockyards have several structural flaws in their design. This is hindering our ability to productively make our heaviest ships. By investing in the renovation of this facility we can correct these structural flaws and streamline the worst of these issues."
 DEP_Marine_battlecruiser:0 "Improve Domestic Designs"
 DEP_Marine_battlecruiser_desc:0 "As our designers begin to feel more comfortable with lower tonnage vessels, they’ve begun to improve their designs, dreaming up heavier and better armoured ships. Recently, a design from the newly minted Deponyian Cargo Ship Guild has seen the development of a capital ship which has the firepower of a battleship but the maneuverability of a cruiser."
 DEP_Marine_big_dreams_idea_two:0 "RADAR Proximity Fuses"
 DEP_Marine_big_dreams_idea_two_desc:0 "While RADAR technology has been readily adopted by our air force, recent advances in design have allowed us to integrate it into our artillery shells. These RADAR proximity fuses can judge how far they are from a target, exploding when close, making them exceptional useful at attacking aircraft, exploding over entrenched positions, and providing effective fire on hostile ships."
 DEP_Marine_u_boot:0 "Hire New Mareland Specialists"
 DEP_Marine_u_boot_desc:0 "While across the Griffonian continent, New Mareland has always enjoyed warm relations with the nations of the River Federation, owing to our common heritage. New Mareland also has easy access to Equestrian naval expertise. By enlisting the help of New Mareland’s engineers and designer we can hopefully capitalize upon this and use Equestrian assets as the foundation of our navy."
 DEP_Marine_destroyer:0 "Enlist Help from the Diamond Mountains"
 DEP_Marine_destroyer_desc:0 "The Royal Diamond Navy is also relatively new and small, being made up of a few light ships. However, the RDS Damazikar and Woofkar were very effective destroyers for their time. By enlisting the help of the Royal Navy’s designers and engineers we can hopefully adopt the diamond dog designs and use them to inspire our indigenous development."
 DEP_Marine_sneaky_dream_idea_one:0 "Reconfigure the River Dockyards"
 DEP_Marine_sneaky_dream_idea_one_desc:0 "Across Deponya there are dozens of small dockyards which service the freshwater vessels that traverse her many rivers. The largest of these rivers can also be navigated by light seafaring warships such as destroyers and submarines. As such, we can begin to outsource work to these dockyards and use their resources to help increase our naval productivity."
 DEP_Marine_heavy_cruiser:0 "Further Assistance from the Mountains"
 DEP_Marine_heavy_cruiser_desc:0 "Our allies in the Diamond Mountains have been tremendously helpful in designing our destroyers, allowing us a cheap but effective means of protecting our coastal waters. Within recent years, their designers have begun to work on a heavy cruiser. If we were to secure this design and coopt it into our fleet, we could benefit greatly from such a heavily armoured vessel."
 DEP_Marine_sneaky_dream_idea_two:0 "Torpedo Development"
 DEP_Marine_sneaky_dream_idea_two_desc:0 "A submarine is little more than a stealthy speedboat without the torpedoes to give it bite.  As such, it should be of our utmost imperative to invest into the development of new and improved torpedo variants with improved speed, distance, and payloads. With these, our navy should have the tools required to defend our interests at sea."
 DEP_Marine_carrier:0 "Barter with Nimbusia"
 DEP_Marine_carrier_desc:0 "When the Nimbusian National Naval Force unveiled the NNS Thunderking, it was received with much fanfare, being the only aircraft carrier on the continent at the time. While its cloud-based design can not be easily replicated by our engineers, it can be adapted to conventional shipbuilding and can help develop our first generation of aircraft carriers."
 DEP_Marine_naval_planes:0 "Collaboration Between Branches"
 DEP_Marine_naval_planes_desc:0 "Due to the low level of industrialization within our nation, both the Royal Deponyian Navy and Royal Deponyian Airforce are newly minted branches of a traditionally army-based military. As such, both are eager to prove themselves and with the recent investment into aircraft carriers the two branches have been given a chance to collaborate and assist each other in this goal."
 DEP_Marine_naval_light_carrier:0 "Indigenous Carrier Designs"
 DEP_Marine_naval_light_carrier_desc:0 "Our designers have become increasingly familiar and comfortable with aircraft carriers and have begun to draft blueprints and design documents independent of our Nimbusian sponsors. While these indigenous carriers are rather light, being built upon river barges, they are still a massive step forwards in terms of naval innovation and native shipbuilding."
 DEP_Marine_flying_dream_idea_one:0 "Diversify Production"
 DEP_Marine_flying_dream_idea_one_desc:0 "The mark of modern industrialism is to diversify production, producing components over a wide range of firms and factories. By doing so we can have one firm working on the hull, another on the deck, a third on the fire control systems, and many more on the various other smaller components. This means that a greater number of productive assets can be committed to a single project."
 DEP_Marine_flying_dream_idea_two:0 "Enlist Nimbusian Officers"
 DEP_Marine_flying_dream_idea_two_desc:0 "The current political climate in Nimbusia has created an exodus of highly skilled military officers. By offering both employment and generous pay to these refugees we can hopefully persuade them to join our military. Nowhere would their impact be greater than within our new carrier battlegroups where their skill and experience in the air can be capitalized upon."
 DEP_Marine_glory_to_us:0 "Dominance of the East"
 DEP_Marine_glory_to_us_desc:0 "With the framework of our navy set in stone, we can now focus upon assuring our dominance of Eastern Griffonian waters. Every dockyard built, every sailor enlisted, and every ship christened brings us one step closer to this dream. Soon our royal banner will be known across the open sea and no port will every deny us."
