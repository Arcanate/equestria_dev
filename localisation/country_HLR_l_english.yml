#Thorygg is dead
arcturian_start.1.t:0 "Early to rise"
arcturian_start.1.d:0 "With a heavy groan, Torygg Brightclaw lifted himself from his bed. Despite being relatively fit for his age, the role of Headmaster had finally begun to take its toll on Torygg’s body. Gone were the days where he bested most other knights in terms of strength and agility. Although he loathed to admit it, Torygg believed that soon he might not be able to lead any more expeditions into the Dread Peninsula.\n\nStill, for the time being he could manage himself. He had to set an example for the young trainees, after all. Torygg glanced out of the window, seeing that the sun had yet to rise. He’d arisen a bit earlier than usual, but soon the rest of Fortress Boreas would awaken and begin their routines. The rugged Headmaster dressed himself in his usual garb, a soft grey and gold tunic with a rusted medal attached to it. He glanced at it briefly, reminiscing on the brief time he’d served in the Royal Army of Griffenheim, long before he’d made the pilgrimage to join the fabled Knights of the Arcturian Order. It seemed like that was a lifetime ago.\n\nTorygg allowed himself a moment’s respite before he began his day. He’d been trying to organize the workforce of the Order to begin constructing a basic road to the Whitetail Mountains in the south, but progress had been slow. Logistics was a surprisingly difficult thing for an old military griff to manage, so he’d enlisted the help of Julius Veck, one of the brightest minds within the Order.\n\nSpeaking of... Torygg opened the door and left his quarters. He had needed to discuss some additional details with Julius, so he made his way to the younger griffon’s room, which was tucked away in a corner far across the fortress.\n\nAs he reached the room, Torygg could have sworn that he heard a female voice behind the door. He chuckled slightly, letting his imagination play guessing games. It was still early in the morning, and he didn’t want to walk in on Julius while he was busy with somegriff… or somepony. “I’ll just come back later,” mused Torygg to himself. He was about to leave when he heard Julius say something alarming.\n\n“...they suspect nothing, Master. I will personally see to it that…”\n\nTorygg’s blood ran cold. Was Julius compromised? Was he enthralled? Torygg turned back, gripped the door handle, then shoved it open. Before him stood the young Julius and a sultry, well-dressed unicorn. Their heads flicked towards Torygg, and there was a brief silence. Alarm bells began ringing in Torygg’s head as he noticed the mare’s crimson irises."
