#Old Man Torygg fucking dies part 1
arcturian_toryggdeath.1.t:0 "Early To Rise"
arcturian_toryggdeath.1.d:0 "With a heavy groan, Torygg Brightclaw lifted himself from his bed. Despite being relatively fit for his age, the role of Headmaster had finally begun to take its toll on Torygg’s body. Gone were the days where he bested most other knights in terms of strength and agility. Although he loathed to admit it, Torygg believed that soon he might not be able to lead any more expeditions into the Dread Peninsula.\n\nStill, for the time being he could manage himself. He had to set an example for the young trainees, after all. Torygg glanced out of the window, seeing that the sun had yet to rise. He’d arisen a bit earlier than usual, but soon the rest of Fortress Boreas would awaken and begin their routines. The rugged Headmaster dressed himself in his usual garb, a soft grey and gold tunic with a rusted medal attached to it. He glanced at it briefly, reminiscing on the brief time he’d served in the Royal Army of Griffenheim, long before he’d made the pilgrimage to join the fabled Knights of the Arcturian Order. It seemed like a lifetime ago.\n\nTorygg allowed himself a moment’s respite before he began his day. He’d been trying to organize the workforce of the Order to begin constructing a basic road to the Whitetail Mountains in the south, but progress had been slow. Logistics was a surprisingly difficult thing for an old military griff to manage, so he’d enlisted the help of Julius Veck, one of the brightest minds within the Order.\n\nSpeaking of... Torygg opened the door and left his quarters. He had needed to discuss some additional details with Julius, so he made his way to the younger griffon’s room, which was tucked away in a corner far across the fortress.\n\nAs he reached the room, Torygg could have sworn that he heard a female voice behind the door. He chuckled slightly, letting his imagination play guessing games. It was still early in the morning, and he didn’t want to walk in on Julius while he was busy with somegriff… or somepony. “I’ll just come back later,” mused Torygg to himself. He was about to leave when he heard Julius say something alarming.\n\n“...they suspect nothing, Master. I will personally see to it that…”\n\nTorygg’s blood ran cold. Was Julius compromised? Was he enthralled? Torygg turned back, gripped the door handle, then shoved it open. Before him stood the young Julius and a sultry, well-dressed unicorn. Their heads flicked towards Torygg, and there was a brief silence. Alarm bells began ringing in Torygg’s head as he noticed the mare’s crimson irises."

#Old Man Torygg fucking dies part 2
arcturian_toryggdeath.2.t:0 "Early Demise"
arcturian_toryggdeath.2.d:0 "Thoughts raced through Torygg’s mind as he established the scene in front of him. Julius was enthralled by a vampire. The vampire in question was inside Fortress Boreas. That meant that it was possible that other knights, possibly even council members within the Order were thralls serving unholy masters. Their sanctuary was no longer safe. He’d been dealing with thralls in low-level positions for ages, but to see one holding a notable rank within the Order… this was bad. Very bad.\n\nTorygg instinctively reached towards his scabbard, then realized that he’d neglected to put it on since he had only expected a casual conversation. He could tell that they both knew this, too. The mare smiled, revealing a set of fangs that glistened in the candlelight. Julius simply stared at him with a blank expression.\n\nThe vampire took a step forward. She spoke with a tender voice, “Stay a while, won’t you?”\n\n“If it’s all the same, I’d rather not.” Torygg really didn’t want to give them an opportunity to escape, but he was ill-equipped to fight them. He methodically reached for the door, preparing to slam it behind him once he actually fled.\n\nWithout taking her eyes off of him, the vampire spoke again, but her voice carried an unnerving tone, as if it were layered over itself multiple times. “Don’t let him escape.”\n\nJulius immediately charged towards Torygg, but was met with solid wood as Torygg quickly stepped back and positioned himself behind the partially-opened door. Torygg then tried to fully close it to buy him some time, but the younger griffon’s claw gripped the bottom rail with an unnatural strength. Torygg grunted as he pulled with all his might, but the enthralled griffon had evidently received some of his master’s vitality. He decided to abandon this strategy and simply flee while calling for help.\n\n“ALARM! ALARM!” shouted Torygg as he ran away from the room. He heard the wood burst into splinters behind him, and before he could turn to see how close his pursuer was, it was too late. Two claws gripped Torygg’s hind legs and he fell to the ground, knocking the wind out of him. Those claws then wrapped themselves around Torygg’s neck and began to choke him from behind. He grabbed the claws and tried to pry them away, but to no avail. His vision began to blur, and as soon as his strength began to waver, Julius shifted his grip from the neck up to Torygg’s head. There was a twist, causing a sickening crack to echo throughout the hall.\n\nThe elder griffon unceremoniously collapsed to the ground. Torygg Brightclaw, Headmaster of the Arcturian Order, had died."

#Oh god of fuck what do we do
arcturian_toryggdeath.3.t:0 "Chaos within the Order"
arcturian_toryggdeath.3.d:0 ""To say that Fortress Boreas was in turmoil would be an understatement. The Headmaster, dead? Murdered in the sanctity of our holy stronghold? By the claw of one of our own? Soon after hearing a call for alarm, guards had found a griffon standing overtop Torygg’s body with an empty look in his eyes. They had apprehended and vigorously questioned him. Soon they determined that the young griffon had not been acting of his free will, and was forced to do it by one of the most despicable creatures to inhabit the cursed Dread Peninsula: a vampire.\n\nA vampire was responsible for Torygg’s death. To make matters worse, it could still be loose inside of the castle. Every able-bodied knight was summoned, even some who were retired or still in training. Within the hour, the entire fortress and its surrounding areas were being torn apart as they looked for wherever the creature might be hiding.\n\nThe Grand Council stood by their chairs in the war room as patrols passed by them. There was a grim atmosphere as they confirmed what little information they knew. Their Headmaster was dead, and the creature responsible was nowhere to be found.\n\n"We should hold a funeral, at the very least," said their youngest member, a griffon by the name of William Steelbeak, "We should be glad they didn’t make off with his body."\n\nA senior member of the council, Østwald Vind, shook his head at this suggestion, "We should not be glad at all, William. What we previously thought to be an impenetrable stronghold has proven to no longer be the case. Our lax security within this fortress has led to the death of our beloved Headmaster. Yes, a funeral is in order, but we have more pressing matters to take care of right now..."
