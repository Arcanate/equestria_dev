HLR_START_beyond_whitetails:0 "Beyond the Whitetails"
HLR_START_beyond_whitetails_desc:0 "For centuries we have remained isolated, partly due to our hesitance to let potential vampires freely leave our territory, and partly because of the vast mountain range between us and the Herzland. Despite these challenges, we must establish our knightly order as a proper nation. If that means establishing contact with our neighbors, then so be it."

HLR_START_William:0 "Speak with the Protégé"
HLR_START_William_desc:0 "William Steelbeak has been under the Headmaster's watchful eye for years. He had suggested some major changes to the Order before, but there never seemed to be enough resources to implement them. Now Torygg believes that the time is right. He must tell his favored former pupil of what is to come."

HLR_START_Elfreda:0 "Organize the Troops"
HLR_START_Elfreda_desc:0 "If we are to formally present ourselves as a proper nation, then we'll need to reform our Knightly Order into a proper army. We will start by gathering our forces to discuss the matter."

HLR_START_Ostwald:0 "Consult the Knight Commander"
HLR_START_Ostwald_desc:0 "Aside from the Headmaster himself, Østwald Vind commands the most authority within the Order. If Torygg is to go forward with his plans to make formal contact with the major powers in the south, then he'll need to run the proposal by his Knight Commander to see if any adjustments are needed." 

HLR_START_Sending_an_envoy:0 "Sending an Envoy..."
HLR_START_Sending_an_envoy_desc:0 "No fledgling nation was built without formal recognition from their neighbors. Torygg has decided that it is time to try and legitimize the Arcturian Order in the eyes of the wider world. To this end, several ambassadorial envoys have been established and are ready to depart on our first official attempt at diplomacy."

HLR_START_To_the_republic:0 "...To the Republic"
HLR_START_To_the_republic_desc:0 "The Republicans. Torygg had a great distaste for their beliefs, but he couldn't deny that their position and politics made them the most likely candidate to formally recognize the Arcturian Order. With any luck, they might send some aid to give the Order the edge they needed against the forces of darkness." #Note: He'd probably be fairly reluctant about the idea considering his past. Should make it feel like a question of Realpolitik here instead of allegiance

HLR_START_To_the_empire_desc:0 "Ah, the Griffonian Empire. Still alive and kicking, much to Torygg's pleasure. He had always held a soft spot for his former home, though it felt strange to present himself as a leader of an independent nation. Hopefully they could work out a trade agreement; the Order could really use some actual firearms."

#Torygg is alive
arcturian_toryggdeath.1.t:0 "Early to rise"
arcturian_toryggdeath.1.d:0 "With a heavy groan, Torygg Brightclaw lifted himself from his bed. Despite being relatively fit for his age, the role of Headmaster had finally begun to take its toll on Torygg’s body. Gone were the days where he bested most other knights in terms of strength and agility. Although he loathed to admit it, Torygg believed that soon he might not be able to lead any more expeditions into the Dread Peninsula.\n\nStill, for the time being he could manage himself. He had to set an example for the young trainees, after all. Torygg glanced out of the window, seeing that the sun had yet to rise. He’d arisen a bit earlier than usual, but soon the rest of Fortress Boreas would awaken and begin their routines. The rugged Headmaster dressed himself in his usual garb, a soft grey and gold tunic with a rusted medal attached to it. He glanced at it briefly, reminiscing on the brief time he’d served in the Royal Army of Griffenheim, long before he’d made the pilgrimage to join the fabled Knights of the Arcturian Order. It seemed like that was a lifetime ago.\n\nTorygg allowed himself a moment’s respite before he began his day. He’d been trying to organize the workforce of the Order to begin constructing a basic road to the Whitetail Mountains in the south, but progress had been slow. Logistics was a surprisingly difficult thing for an old military griff to manage, so he’d enlisted the help of Julius Veck, one of the brightest minds within the Order.\n\nSpeaking of... Torygg opened the door and left his quarters. He had needed to discuss some additional details with Julius, so he made his way to the younger griffon’s room, which was tucked away in a corner far across the fortress.\n\nAs he reached the room, Torygg could have sworn that he heard a female voice behind the door. He chuckled slightly, letting his imagination play guessing games. It was still early in the morning, and he didn’t want to walk in on Julius while he was busy with somegriff... or somepony. "I’ll just come back later," mused Torygg to himself. He was about to leave when he heard Julius say something alarming.\n\n"...they suspect nothing, Master. I will personally see to it that..."\n\nTorygg’s blood ran cold. Was Julius compromised? Was he enthralled? Torygg turned back, gripped the door handle, then shoved it open. Before him stood the young Julius and a sultry, well-dressed unicorn. Their heads flicked towards Torygg, and there was a brief silence. Alarm bells began ringing in Torygg’s head as he noticed the mare’s crimson irises."
arcturian_toryggdeath.1.a:0 "A vampire!"

#Torygg is kill
arcturian_toryggdeath.2.t:0 "Early Demise"
arcturian_toryggdeath.2.d:0 "Thoughts raced through Torygg’s mind as he established the scene in front of him. Julius was enthralled by a vampire. The vampire in question was inside Fortress Boreas. That meant that it was possible that other knights, possibly even council members within the Order were thralls serving unholy masters. Their sanctuary was no longer safe. He’d been dealing with thralls in low-level positions for ages, but to see one holding a notable rank within the Order... this was bad. Very bad.\n\nTorygg instinctively reached towards his scabbard, then realized that he’d neglected to put it on since he had only expected a casual conversation. He could tell that they both knew this, too. The mare smiled, revealing a set of fangs that glistened in the candlelight. Julius simply stared at him with a blank expression.\n\nThe vampire took a step forward. She spoke with a tender voice, "Stay a while, won’t you?"\n\n"If it’s all the same, I’d rather not." Torygg really didn’t want to give them an opportunity to escape, but he was ill-equipped to fight them. He methodically reached for the door, preparing to slam it behind him once he actually fled.\n\nWithout taking her eyes off of him, the vampire spoke again, but her voice carried an unnerving tone, as if it were layered over itself multiple times. "Don’t let him warn the others."\n\nJulius immediately charged towards Torygg, but was met with solid wood as Torygg quickly stepped back and positioned himself behind the partially-opened door. Torygg then tried to fully close it to buy him some time, but the younger griffon’s claw gripped the bottom rail with an unnatural strength. Torygg grunted as he pulled with all his might, but the enthralled griffon had evidently received some of his master’s vitality. He decided to abandon this strategy and simply flee while calling for help.\n\n"ALARM! ALARM!" shouted Torygg as he ran away from the room. He heard the wood burst into splinters behind him, and before he could turn to see how close his pursuer was, it was too late. Two claws gripped Torygg’s hind legs and he fell to the ground, knocking the wind out of him. Those claws then wrapped themselves around Torygg’s neck and began to choke him from behind. He grabbed the claws and tried to pry them away, but to no avail. His vision began to blur, and as soon as his strength began to waver, Julius shifted his grip from the neck up to Torygg’s head. With a jerk, he twisted it until a sickening crack was heard.\n\nThe elder griffon unceremoniously collapsed to the ground. Torygg Brightclaw, Headmaster of the Arcturian Order, had died."
arcturian_toryggdeath.2.a:0 "The end of an era."

#Arcturian Order discovers Torygg is dead
arcturian_toryggdeath.3.t:0 "Chaos within the Order"
arcturian_toryggdeath.3.d:0 "To say that Fortress Boreas was in turmoil would be an understatement. The Headmaster, dead? Murdered in the sanctity of our holy stronghold? By the claw of one of our own? Soon after hearing a call for alarm, guards had found a griffon standing overtop Torygg’s body with an empty look in his eyes. They had apprehended and vigorously questioned him. Soon they determined that the young griffon had not been acting of his free will, and was forced to do it by one of the most despicable creatures to inhabit the cursed Dread Peninsula: a vampire.\n\nA vampire was responsible for Torygg’s death. To make matters worse, it could still be loose inside of the castle. Every able-bodied knight was summoned, even some who were retired or still in training. Within the hour, the entire fortress and its surrounding areas were being torn apart as they looked for wherever the creature might be hiding.\n\nThe Grand Council stood by their chairs in the war room as patrols passed by them. There was a grim atmosphere as they confirmed what little information they knew. Their Headmaster was dead, and the creature responsible was nowhere to be found.\n\n"We should hold a funeral, at the very least," said their youngest member, a griffon by the name of William Steelbeak, "We should be glad they didn’t make off with his body."\n\nA senior member of the council, Østwald Vind, shook his head at this suggestion, "We should not be glad at all, William. What we previously thought to be an impenetrable stronghold has proven to no longer be the case. Our lax security within this fortress has led to the death of our beloved Headmaster. Yes, a funeral is in order, but we have more pressing matters to take care of right now...""
arcturian_toryggdeath.3.a:0 ""...such as determining who will succeed him.""



arcturian_toryggdeath.4.t:0 "Righteous Fury"
arcturian_toryggdeath.4.d:0 ""To arms, to arms!" shouted the armored mare.\n\nAll around Fortress Arcturius, knights of every caliber were preparing themselves. Barking orders at them was a young knight-lieutenant by the name of Elfreda. She spared no expense in her demands: every able-bodied knight and even some trainees were to arm themselves to the teeth for a grand crusade the likes of which have not been seen in their entire lives.\n\nFrom the balcony over the barracks, Elfreda stood over the troops who were engaged in the organized chaos. She thought back to the terrible battle in her hometown where she had been rescued as a teenage filly by Torygg's forces. She shuddered at the memory; darkness had nearly swallowed her then. From that day she vowed to make every last creature within the Dread Peninsula burn.\n\nToday that day had come. Though she technically didn't have the authority to command this many troops, she knew that she had more spine than the knight-captains stationed here. They couldn't stop her. They would see- No, the entire Order would see what she was capable of doing.\n\n"Brothers and sisters!" she shouted, her commanding voice echoing throughout the barracks, "Soon we will make the monsters of the Dread Peninsula pay! The death of our beloved Headmaster is not something to be met with sorrow, but with fury! We will go beyond the safety of our walls and slay the creatures responsible for Torygg's demise! Those monstrous, vile abominations must be snuffed out! We will burn every last body of theirs until we can find no more! If they think that they can walk into our homes and kill our leaders, then we will teach them that we can do the same a hundred times over!" Elfreda resoundingly stomped her hoof, "We march tonight!""

<<<<<<< HEAD
POLITICS_TORYGG_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! 951 ALB, Crona, Griffonian Empire\n\n§YBiography:§! Born to humble smiths in the inner city, Torygg spent the early years of his life enamoured by stories of the gods who watched over Griffonkind. At the age of 14 he began to make daily trips to pray at the local temples of Boreas, Arcturius, and Eyr. His devotion to the gods became tested in the year 979, when he found himself taking up arms against his fellow griffons who had taken the seat of Griffenheim away from the young Grover V, who in Torygg’s eyes was the chosen of Boreas. He would like to say that he had played a critical role in restoring the rightful ruler of Griffenheim to the throne, but inside he knew that he had sinned... even though the republicans he slew had denounced the Grovers, they were still his former friends and neighbors. Torygg saw himself no longer worthy in the eyes of Boreas or Eyr, so he turned his faith towards Arcturius. In 982, he heard rumors of a legendary lost detachment of Arcturian Knights in the far north, and so he made the journey beyond the Whitetail Mountains to find them. There he became acquainted with the Knights of the Arcturian Order.\n\nThough Torygg was not a traditional knight by the Order’s definition, he had quickly proven his worth by his knowledge of strategy and tactics that he’d learned in the Herzland. Rising to the rank of Knight Captain by 985, his troops became among the most skilled and respected in the Order. His greatest challenge came in 996, when a sudden incursion from the Dread Peninsula overwhelmed the knights defending The Passage. The entire region was nearly overrun by the time Torygg’s forces had arrived. Rushing quickly to join the massive battle at Fortress Arcturius, Torygg had shown up just in time to watch the previous Headmaster of the Order be decapitated by a fearsome lich. Seeing such a horrifying sight had filled the Knight Captain with a righteous fury, and so he drew his old Griffonian Musket and shot the monster’s skull, severely disorienting it. With a roar, Torygg charged the lich, forcing his way through the horde of undead and piercing the creature with the bayonet of his gun, which he had dipped in blessed Holy Water. Instantly the creature and its legions fell, and Torygg stood victorious at the painful cost of The Passage and his Headmaster’s life.\n\nSince then, Torygg had risen to a legendary status within the Order, soon earning the title of Headmaster himself. He has pushed for changes in the Order’s arsenal, but understands that they simply lack the infrastructure to support supplying every knight with a gun. Because of this, he has updated their training regimen to prioritize living to see another day, rather than dying heroically... like his predecessor did.\n\n§YPortrait By:§! Neither"
