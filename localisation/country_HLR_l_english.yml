arcturian.1.t:0 "A History of the Arcturian Order\nThe Warderns of the North"
arcturian.1.d:0 "The North, it is  cold, dark, and sparsely populated. Upon which lies the Arcturian Order, and ancient holy order founded around the faith and ideals of 12 churches dedicated to the sanctity of The Holy Light.\n\nA Thousand years ago, on the long night, necromancers came pouring from the east. Large armies of undead cadavers in tow, they nearly overwhelmed the the lands now known as the Arcturian Order. Local church millitant were the only ones capable of doing anything to stem the tide and push them back. The century that followed saw the Arcturian Order being formed by Desmond the Fell-Claw, Holy Father of the Sun Goddess. The Arcturian Order was created for the sole purpose of protecting the living from the foul denizens from the east. Ever since that fateful day nine hundred years ago, they have done their job.\n\nRecent years have written a different story however, as something is amiss in the Dread Peninsula. Border raids have increased in frequency and unicorns in the Order have felt dark energies accumulate beyond the borders. The twelve churches believe themselves ready to weather the storm.\n\nThe question is though, are they really?"
arcturian.1.a:0 "To answer this, we must look to the East."

arcturian.2.t:0 "The Mantle of Headmaster\nThe Future of the Arcturian Order"
arcturian.2.d:0 "The senate is in chaos, not one person can make heads or feathers of the situation. Headmaster Torygg is dead, murdered at the hooves of a changeling from an unknown hive. The Arcturian Order mourns the loss of Torygg, he was seen an upstanding and benevolent leader, his actions always adhering to a sound moral code.\n\nThe senate must choose a new Headmaster. A group within the senate has been advocating for one Willian Steel Beak, whilst a group of traditionalists within the senate have shown interest in Østwald Vind.\n\nWilliam Steel Beak was Torygg's first choice, as he had all the values and characteristics that Torygg saw as what the Arcturian Order needed. William is devoted to the common citizen and the well-being of the inhabitants, he understands the plight of the common Arcturian and is doing his best to answer their pleas. He even believes that anyone has the right to redemption, even the most tainted of hearts have that right in his eyes.\n\nØstwald Vind is an Arcturian traditionalist and follows his faith by the very script they are written in, he gives no room for interpretation. The Arcturian order is a tool against the undead hordes to the east, a bastion against the dead and nothing more. He loves the Order as much as the next griffon does, but through deliberation and hard work, he will see through to the Order's plans. Østwald Vind believes that once you tread down the dark path, the only redeption you will find is that of the bladed edge of a sword.\n\nBoth men love the Order, both men will serve to their fullest, but both men have different views on what is right and what is neccecary. The senate will need deliberate over this information."
arcturian.2.a:0 "Both candidates are promising, but a choice must be made."

arcturian.3.t:0 "The Economy is Restored\nAll Eyes now look to the East"
arcturian.3.d:0 "After the assasination of Torygg, the economy fell apart. Uncertainty and fear had swept the nation, consuming all confidence among the citizenry. Smiths left their iron. Weavers left their looms and wardens left their posts at prisons. All progress towards modernization was halted as the government descended into chaos. \n\n The situation us untenable, especially with the Dreaded Necromancers of Magehold knocking at our door across the Holy Line. New policies or not, the new government must get the people working again.\n\n[HLR.GetLeader]'s next actions must be swift so that we may now focus our energies east. The time is nigh, and as the clock strikes eleven, we know the time of battle draws near. There is no longer room for Error."
arcturian.3.a:0 "Now we must focus on the real issue."
