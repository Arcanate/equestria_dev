barrad_silver_star.1.d:0 "His Magistrate Silver Star is known for his overbearing paranoia. However, it seems to run deeper than expected, as even in sleep, he is not able to escape it.\n\nThe mage came running out of his room in a fit of madness, shouting at the top of his lungs about the horrors he'd seen. When the servants managed to pin him down, he proceeded to go on about being chased by terrifying monsters who sought to tear into him. He then talked about seeing his allies surrounding him and unsheathing daggers before stabbing him repeatedly, leaving him a withered husk in the woods\n\nThe servants tried to reassure him, but it was to no avail. Silver Star got up and went around the halls, ordering for extra security to be posted around his bedroom and for the servants to be on alert for any possible assassins. He then locked himself in his bedroom and paced around, rambling about traitors and spies."

barrad_first.1.t:0 "The Invitation"
barrad_first.1.d:0 "Deep in his study on a stormy night, Count Ambrosius paced in candlelight, dictating a letter to an enormous seated griffon. "Dear friend," began Ambrosius. "I extend to you an invitation to attend a great celebration. The most esteemed creatures of the land will be in attendance, and together we shall witness amazing wonders, the likes of which have never before been conceived!" Just saying the words made Ambrosius hop in excitement. "Come to my manor at once so that we may begin the festivities. Your friend, Count Ambrosius I." The griffon struggled to keep up with Ambrosius' words, scribbling as fast as he could onto a piece of parchment. "Oh this will be fun. So fun!" laughed Ambrosius.\n\nThe griffon finished writing and looked up to Ambrosius. "Who should receive this message?" The Count stood still, not acknowledging the question at all. "The Pentarchy?" asked the griffon.\n\n"Pentarchy. Pentarchy..." Ambrosius stared off into nothingness, trailing off for a moment. "Well, we simply must have Viira. Her extraordinary talents will help us greatly." Ambrosius tapped his chin. "And Leopold. To deny our party a mind like his would simply not do at all! He shall be there. Silver Star, on the other hoof..." The Count's face twisted in disgust. "Very rude guest. We could do without him. And... what was that old zebra's name again?"\n\nThe griffon unhooked a vial of liquid from around his neck and offered it to Ambrosius, who greedily took a swig. The Count blinked several times before glancing around the room."Thank you, Gąsienica." He sighed and sunk into a chair. "Yes. Send it to the Pentarchy.""

barrad_first.3.d:0 "The Count gathered the rest of the Pentarchy in his manor. Expecting a party, they were surprised to hear the Count giving them an order: to gather the other nobles of the realm. The four begrudgingly accepted began to walk off, when, out of nowhere Cpt.Gąsienica offerred to do the job himself. The Pentarchy was surprised, but when they recollected, they gladly gave him the job."
barrad_first.3.a:0 "Off to get this mess togheter."
barrad_first.4.t:0 "The Feast"
barrad_first.4.d:0 "The Count rose before the nobles and other Pentarchy members gathered in his manor. He began to speak, thanking them all for their presence. He gleefully told them of the great hunt that he had arranged. The nobles were ecstatic and pressed the Count to tell them more. He told them that there was much game in the woods, and that it was only increasing in number.\n\nHe then announced in a loud voice, “And so, dear friends, it is time to poach this game, in a grand hunt!” Speaking in a softer tone, he said, “But before the hunt can begin, we must first feast to prepare our spirits for such a spectacle. Today, you will see before you the most exquisite food and vintage drink that I could produce. Let us dine, then, to our health, and to glory!”\n\n“To glory!”, exclaimed the nobles, who quickly set about to devouring the food brought before them, before downing it with copious amounts of wine and beer.\n\nAs the Count prepared to dine, Silver Star nervously asked to be excused. The Count reluctantly allowed him to go, before returning to his meal and mug."
barrad_first.4.a:0 "A truly excellent feast!"
barrad_first.5.t:0 "The Hunt"
barrad_first.5.d:0 "The day after the feast, the Count rallied the hunters. He distributed high-grade weapons, produced in Leopold’s forge, he then told them about the game they were to find. With all of the Pentarchy members arriving in the space of a few hours, the hunting party, numbering about a hundred members, set out from Ambrosius’ manor. They began to trek into the woods, killing any lone adventurers and small bands they found, as well as a few unfortunate peasants. They went on for hours killing over a dozen ponies and griffons in the woods and putting their bodies in a wagon that Asinti ordered be dragged along with the party. Even Silver Star, in spite of his nervous disposition, was able to kill a few adventurers, for which he was lauded by his allies, especially Ambrosius.\n\nThe party had begun to turn back, when they heard a noise off to the side. The Pentarchy, along with a few dozen nobles went off to find out what the cause of it was, whilst the others guarded their bounty. When the expedition came to the source, they found a well-sized band of adventurers preparing to execute a small number of oddly dressed ponies. The expedition quickly cut down the adventurers and captured the robed ponies. They returned to the main party and continued back to the manor."
barrad_first.5.a:0 "What a great bounty indeed!"
barrad_first.51.t:0 "The Discovery"
barrad_first.51.d:0 "After sorting out their bounty, and having yet another feast, most of the nobles retired to their own estates, and the peasants were set free. The Pentarchy quickly assembled to address the elephant in the room, the captured ponies. Asinti pleaded for them to be given to him, to which Viira responded, “Don’t you have enough, doctor?” Ambrosius quickly silenced them before stating his own plan:\n\n“It is clear that we know very little about these strange ponies. I am dying to know more about them. I propose that we interrogate them, to find out who or even what they are.”\n\nThe other Pentarchy members nodded in agreement. The ponies were briefly interrogated, before they offered to show the magistrates their meeting place. The ponies showed the Pentarchy into a cave containing all sorts of mysterious inscriptions. It was rightfully assumed that these were members of some sort of ancient cult. The last thing the cultists presented was a series of runes that looked like instruction for some kind of device. The type of device was completely beyond the Pentarchy members, and even the cultists had little knowledge of it. Sated with this knowledge, the Pentarchy split up, with Silver Star racing back to his tower, Asinti and Viira engaging in a lengthy argument, Leopold trying to figure out how the device worked, and Ambrosius drinking a few pints of ale, before passing out on his throne."
barrad_first.51.a:0 "How... interesting."
barrad_first.6.t:0 "Finding Silver"
barrad_first.6.d:0 "After scouring through half of Elysium looking for him, Leopold got the brilliant idea to search Silver Star's tower. Upon reaching the tower, they were interrogated at length about their intentions. Half an hour later, they were let in. They entered the mage's room, only to find it empty. The two groaned and turned around to leave. They were walking past the large closet in the room when Asinti heard something.\n\n"Did you hear that scratching, Leopold? It sounded like it was coming from the closet. Surely he wouldn't"...\n\n"Where else would he possibly go?"\n\n"The bathroom, like any other sensible creature."\n\nAsinti burst the closet wide open to reveal a whimpering and petrified Silver Star. Silver fell out like a piece of timber, with Leopold barely breaking his fall. He set the unicorn down on the floor gently, and then walked over to Asinti.\n\n "How are we going to convince him to come with us?"\n\n"Don't worry, I've got this under control."\n\n Asinti proceeded to make loud sounds at Silver, telling hm about a terrifying band of cossacks in the woods that they were about to hunt and that the Count wanted Silver to lead the party. Leopold, witnessing Silver's increasing fear, pushed Asinti aside, and began to reassure Silver that there were no cossacks and that the Count only wanted to see him. Silver slowly got up and left with them, though very timidly. Asinti and Leopold followed, and the griffon loudly scolded Asinti for his poor behavior."
barrad_first.6.a:0 "Silver Star will remember that."
barrad_second.1.t:0 "Matters"
barrad_second.1.d:0 "In the study of Count Ambrosius, the other four members of the Pentarchy sat around a table, contemplating the strange events they had witnessed. "Since our brave Count is currently incapacitated, it is up to us to us to decypher the meaning of this." Viira placed the mysterious codex down on the table. "We need a plan of action," she said, glancing at each of her compatriots. Leopold paid her no mind, continuing to study the inscriptions he had copied from the cave. Asinti's eyes were closed and his head bobbed slowly. Was he sleeping? Silver Star scowled and grabbed the codex with his magic.\n\n"I am certain that one of the ancient books in my possession will have the information needed to understand these runes," said Silver Star, narrowing his eyes. "I would never allow any of YOU to get a peek at my library, though." He shifted his gaze around the room, suspiciously. "That would be unwise. Very unwise," he muttered to himself.\n\nLeopold waved a dismissive claw. "If we put our minds to it, we can figure this out on our own. No need for any of your obscure, dusty texts," he said matter-of-factly. Silver Star pursed his lips and pushed the codex back to the middle of the table.\n\n"That would take too long, Leopold. We have to go to the source of this." Viira tapped the codex. "We need to get in contact with the cult, so we can question them and find out more," she said. Her tone left no room for argument; it was clearly an order, not a suggestion.\n\n"No." A raspy voice arose. "I can hear their whispers." Asinti looked at Viira with wide eyes. "Yes, we should track down the cult. But not to question them, to kidnap them! Their sacrifice will please the ones beyond." His face broke into a wide smile. The other three eyed Asinti in silence."
barrad_second.1.a:0 "What to do..."
barrad_second.2.t:0 "A Wonderful Idea"
barrad_second.2.d:0 "As morning sunlight filtered in through clouded windows, Count Ambrosius emerged from his bedchamber and stretched. Standing guard by the entrance, Gąsienica was ready to greet him. "Feeling better, sir?"\n\n"Yes, incredibly!" Ambrosius laughed and slapped Gąsienica's back. "You know, it's been so dull around here lately." He began trotting through the halls of the manor with Gąsienica keeping pace at his side. "But that party was invigorating. Hunting! Killing! Mystery! So much excitement..." Ambrosius stroked his beard in contemplation. "I know what we must do: throw another party, bigger and grander." The Count was positively giddy by the time he entered the throne room.\n\n"More drinking, more feasting, more merriment!" Ambrosius was smiling just imagining the festivities. "Begin preparations at once! Send out invitations to the Pentarchy, and all the nobles." He slowly turned to face Gąsienica, his smile remaining but his eyes becoming dark. "And make sure our guests know that refusing to attend will have severe consequences.""
barrad_second.2.a:0 "Let's break out the booze!"
barrad_second.3.t:0 "Now You See Them..."
barrad_second.3.d:0 ""You've never- Unbelievable! You simply must witness it," Ambrosius implored the group of nobles around him, before turning to wave across the hall. "Viira, care to entertain our guests?" he shouted. The doe sighed, and began to walk toward the balcony. Ambrosius galloped to join her and beckoned for the group to follow. From the manor's balcony the two looked over a nearby village, as well as the untamed forests and mountains in the distance. Ambrosius pointed to the village watchtower. "There, that's a good spot."\n\nViira focused intensely before closing her eyes. A strange energy could be felt in the air around her, and her Seer's robes began to ripple with magical power. Suddenly, a large section of the village surrounding the tower became shrouded in a dark fog. When the fog dissipated, everything that had been inside it was gone. "Spectacular!" shouted one of the guests, as the rest of them mumbled in amazement. "Where did it all go?" asked another.\n\nViira smirked. "A magician never reveals her secrets.""

barrad_second.6.d:0 "Deep into the night, Viira sat studying the codex, looking closely at its inscriptions and comparing them to every ancient script she had samples of. She sighed in frustration, yet another dead end. The runes were alien, but at the same time they seemed so familiar. There was still a missing piece to the puzzle. She needed answers, and so she took the codex and journeyed through the woods to return to the cave. At the entrance, she saw a solitary pony emerging from its depths. "What were you doing in there?" asked Viira.\n\nThe pony stopped in his tracks. "Just exploring," he answered. Viira examined him closely, there was something odd about him. He wore strangely fine clothes, and didn't seem very comfortable in the natural environment.\n\n"Anything inside?" asked Viira. The pony shook his head, agitated. "Is that so? Because I believe I've met some of your friends who would disagree." Viira took out the codex and showed it to the pony, whose eyes went wide in realisation. He became tense, silently staring at Viira. "Please, I mean you no harm. I just want to understand," she pleaded.\n\nThe pony scrutinised her for a long moment, before sighing. "We will be in touch. If you prove your intentions, you will find your answers." He trotted off into the forest without saying another word."

bar_pen_screen_silver_info_text:0 "Fear and desire. These emotions have come to define the life of the unicorn known as Silver Star. Originally he was nothing more than another arrogant scion of the Wittenland noble class. Scheming, somewhat paranoid, and jealous of those in a better position. In this case, it was jealousy directed at a sibling - Queen Whitestar of Wittenland, who managed, much to the dismay of Silver Star, to become the monarch of the realm purely through her magical talent.\n\nUsually, such nobles would remain in the background of important matters of the world, lacking in ability to fulfill their ambition. However, fate had other plans for Silver Star, for he would for one reason or other travel to the very borders of the Wittenland. Here Silver Star would learn why the griffons were such a threat to the creatures of the Riverlands. He would experience several raids by the griffon cossacks and would nearly perish during them.\n\nThe raid affected him greatly, and the culmination of these experiences were recurring nightmares of his untimely death. This pushed Silver Star into studying powerful magic, as one theme was present in all of these dreams no matter who slew him - a lack of power and inability to persist beyond the weakness of his flesh. He would become obsessed with his own mortality, and this led the unicorn down a very dark path, as no matter how much power and knowledge he acquired, the enemies in his nightmares persisted; unbeatable and impossible to endure as ever. And after reaching ones potential in raw magical prowess, there remains only one way to become stronger – by breaking the greatest of taboos in most magical societies. Thus, in an attempt triumph over all his perceived enemies, which Silver Star believed were circling him like vultures, the unicorn turned to dark magic.\n\nHowever, despite his ever increasing power, the safety that Silver Star desired seemed to be fleeting. His paranoia only worsened, as usage of the dark arts transformed his body and mind, forcing him into hiding as it became obvious to any magical creature that the unicorn was being corrupted by the darkness. And yet, for all this power, it was not enough. To Silver Star, his enemies were everywhere, simply waiting for a perfect moment to slay him. And for all this power, he was still unable to master death itself.\n\nWith these fears of demise and desire for power, it was no wonder that Silver Star was very willing to accept the invitation that was presented by Ambrosius. After all, even among the chaos of the Griffonian continent, few were as appreciative and accepting of the dark arts and their user’s talents. Furthermore, perhaps due to some remnants of his pride, Silver Star believed that Ambrosius, an earth pony, nor any of his allies and subordinates belonging to other races, were a danger to him, or at least Silver Star was unwilling to admit that.\n\nNow Silver Star spends his time studying any and all knowledge of unicorn magic that can be found. All in an effort to become so powerful that nothing would be able to hurt him, and death would never be able to take him."
bar_pen_asinti_info_text:0 "“The ends justify the means” is a very popular statement among many ideologues, especially those representing the radical parts of the political spectrum. However if one would bring up the means that Asinti uses, many of these radicals would be horrified and agree that whatever the end goal is, there is no way for what the elder zebra shaman is doing to be justified.\n\nOriginally, Asinti was but a mere slave, a victim of the brutal institution that is still dominant in many parts of Zebrica. Many who experienced such fate would try enduring, if not resisting against their subjugators. Yet it seems that most lacked “strong spirit”, as in recorded history, Asinti was the only zebra slave that has been approached by a power from beyond the material realm. This ally from the immaterium helped Asinti to free himself from the shackles of slavery, slay his former owner and flee, eventually getting to a country established by similar runaways.\n\nThe ideals of Kasa Free State greatly inspired Asinti, as living among so many zebras, deer and griffons that had fled similar fates and desired to end slavery and serfdom across the world, convinced the zebra shaman that maybe there is a way to do more than survive. His otherwordly ally, like always, was supporting and helpful, agreeing in the notion and even suggesting a rather fascinating plan. According to the creature, Asinti was a very unique individual, with a spirit that burned like a roaring fire, which meant that he could interact with the plane of the divine, and thus could be noticed by deities and spirits. Most other creatures lacked such a trait and thus lacked the power to liberate themselves. But what if they could somehow be connected to this realm of divine?\n\nHowever, this was not such an easy task as no matter what Asinti did, he couldn’t find what exactly made him so special. As years and even decades went on, with desperation caused by the ever increasing brutality of the world and whispers from beyond always encouraging him, the zebra chose to employ more and more questionable methods. While eventually Asinti did succeed and found a way to transfer the creatures of immaterium into bodies of living things. He saw it as the solution to the seemingly eternal struggle of Kasa, even if the initial method was less than stellar. The leadership of Kasa reacted to revealed actions of Asinti with horror and the zebra shaman was driven out of the country.\n\nWhile Asinti had heavy disagreements with other members of the Pentarchy, the proposal of Ambrosius and all the magic knowledge and resources it brought was too good to pass up. After all, with these means the elder zebra shaman could now achieve the end he was striving for so long."
bar_pen_ambrosius_info_text:0 "Once a prominent merchant and artisan, Ambrosius lived a decadent life, surrounded by luxury and wealth. His true goal, becoming one of the noble class, always remained out of his hooves no matter how much he spent on appearances and magical artefacts. To the peers in their lofty castles, Ambrosius would always remain a haughty upstart, reaching for the stars.\n\nEventually, Ambrosius began to grow tired of conventional life. He retreated to his stately mansion in countryside of Barrad, away from the courtly intrigue of Wittenburgh, where he began unravelling the true mysteries of magic. Lack of progress drove Ambrosius to boredom, and he returned to his usual routine of courting local nobles. They were more receptive to his silver tongue, and began to see Ambrosius as one of them, which would become crucial later on. Rumours began to float that Ambrosius was engaged in acts of debauchery that would put to shame the average noble, or even conspired with malevolent spirits for a grasp at true power. It was dismissed as fever dreams and servant gossip, until it was too late.\n\nOne day, Barrad became wrapped in fog and storm, impenetrable to sight and body, nopony knowing what transpired for weeks until the mists cleared. As Wittenland's authority had become increasingly atrophied, Ambrosius had a free reign ruling over the blasted earth, the trapped ponies remaining as his playthings and subjects of experiments. Over time, he would invite like-minded creatures to join him in the pursuit for knowledge, without ethical strings attached. It would seem that Ambrosius was finally cured of his restless ennui, or so he convinces himself."
bar_pen_leopold_info_text:0 "The desire to help others is a noble one, especially when one wants to help potentially the entire continent, if not the world. It was this desire that would define the life of a griffon known as Leopold.\n\nLeopold was born and spent his early life in the Herzlands, the heart of the Empire, and of course, one of the most technologically and scientifically, at the time, advanced region of the world. Perhaps this is how the griffon managed to survive this long, though most agree it would be better if he perished as a young chick. For since his very first years, Leopold was a very sickly griffon, with only the best medicine available preserving his life.\n\nIt was this sickness and weakness which would accompany him his whole life, combined with his genius, that would define Leopold’s life goal, which to most would be quite unorthodox, to say the absolute least. For differently from most other great minds of Griffonia, even those from universities such as Gamia, wouldn’t think of such solution for biological issues. For differently from the students and professors of Yale, he believed that instead of relying on medicine or even biological modifications, it would be technological enhancement that would allow sickly and weak to survive and reach their potential. This belief was only reinforced as Leopold managed to somewhat alleviate his own condition by the usage of magical crystal injections and enchanted machines which assist his organs. Though these additions also had another effect of greatly increasing Leopold’s physical abilities…\n\nThis sidefect led to the first of many heavily unorthodox and to many unacceptable ideas that the griffon had to alleviate the countless and growing issues of Griffonia. Instead of just using his research to heal the weak and broken, Leopold could use it to protect them from becoming as such by creating a force of griffons that through the usage of magical technology were pushed beyond the limits of their flesh. After all, considering the most prosperous and stable realm in the world - Equestria, survived through the efforts of the great few, would Griffonia not benefit from such heroes, if manufactored?\n\nHowever to most, even the most wicked of Gamia, this sounded like insanity and worst of heresies, and thus Leopold was forced to flee beyond where the rapidly shrinking power of Griffon Empire could hunt him down. In his exile he would be approached by Ambrosius, who surprisingly applauded such an idea and more importantly, the potential of the mastermind behind it, inviting him to come to a domain where such ideas could be entertained.\n\nMany years have passed since then, and now Leopold is something far beyond the wide eyed genius idealist. While initially reluctant to apply the usual Barrad methodology, the seemingly endless brutality of Griffonian collapse, has convinced the Griffon that the sacrifices are worth the potential result. Furthermore, now Leopold doesn’t limit himself to the idea of creating modified heroes, rather he thinks that Griffonia needs it’s own “alicorns”, demigods who could rule and protect the populace, and believes that through magical and technological modifications, he could become this saviour."
bar_pen_viira_info_text:0 "When we are little, most of us are told that we are special, unique, nothing like the other inhabitants of this world. In many cases this belief is shattered as we grow up and learn the world is just that much more larger and we are nothing special in the grand scheme of things. For very specific cases however, it’s different. One of these special cases is Viira the Seer.\n\nViira was born as a deer with substantial magical powers, quite the rarity for the species who rarely possessed active magical abilities. Thus since her youth she was spoiled and treated like an offspring of the highest of lords, despite her somewhat unremarkable bloodline, all while taught the mysteries of the strange magic of the deer. She excelled at the art due to certain quirks, such as her extreme hyperfocus and single-minded concentration on certain topics, learning and mastering the few controlled magical abilities deer could have at an extremely young age. This was her greatest triumph yet, but which wouldn’t really last as Viira would soon discover that many species were far more powerful than the deer, in both their countries and their magical abilities.\n\nThis was a shattering revelation to the young doe, who thought herself on top of the world. But it also gave her inspiration, after all if other creatures could use their magic to dominate the physical world to such an effect, why not deer? The issue must have been that no seer has thought or attempted of reaching such heights, or of course was too weak or lazy to try achieving something. She wasn’t like that. And of course this would also mean that there was no future for Viira in her home, thus she left to wander the world, searching for any magical secrets which could lead to a deer becoming as powerful as the magic users of other races.\n\nViira would become somewhat of an oddity in many places, a single doe wandering the land in pristine exotic clothes which most don’t recognize, to the frustration of the seer, usually carrying around several tomes for recording any new information. Her priorities and acting towards others would also be surprising to onlookers, as she would choose to speak with a simple peasant rather than the lord or flip from polite to furious all based on what sort of knowledge about magic the creature in question would posses. An exception to this pattern would be countries openly dominated by magicians, as these were the only places where Viira would show respect and even admiration, and try mingling with the elite in an attempt to learn how such paradises were created and governed. It would be during one of such meetings, that Viira would meet Ambrosius and hear about his proposal. She of course accepted, after all, who could refuse?\n\nNow Viira spends her time as one of the more distant members of the Barrad pentarchy, studying magical arts within her quarters, trying to achieve the ability of dominating the material world through her magic so that one day she could bring this knowledge and the enlightened ideal of rule of the magical to the rest of deerkind."
