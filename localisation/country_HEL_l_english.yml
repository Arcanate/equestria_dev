HEL_reassure_the_anarchists:0 "Convince The Anarchists"

HEL_dispersed_air_doctrine_desc:0 "There is no point in possesing neither the airfields, nor the airplanes, if we do not know how to use them on the field of battle.

HEL_integrate_the_militias:0 "Absorb The Militias"
HEL_integrate_the_militias_desc:0 "While we wish our army to remain decentralized we must ensure that all the militias of Adelart can still remain under the army's general control.

HEL_the_sisters_of_eyr:0 "Integrate The Sisters Of Eyr"
HEL_the_sisters_of_eyr_desc:0 "The sisters of Eyr are an... eccentric group. Parading around Adelart in their iron behemoths they enforce the will of the gods on the land. We should make an effort to try to associate them with our military and use their divine strength."

HEL_the_jade_company:0 "Integrate The Jade Company"
HEL_the_jade_company_desc:0 "The Jade company are a group of republican militias with no centralized command, just a common name, and cause.

HEL_introduce_field_hospitals:0 "Introduce Field Hospitals"
HEL_introduce_field_hospitals_desc:0 "Field hospitals are by no means a new innovation in warfare but are new to the less organized armies of the world.

#Democratic Decentralization Path

HEL_a_direct_democracy:0 "A Decentralized, Direct, Democracy!"
HEL_a_direct_democracy_desc:0 "While there are many ways of governance which allegedly represent the interests of the population, only a decentralized and direct democracy truly represents the interests of the populace, thus it is the only way of governance worth to pursue."

HEL_switzerland:0 "The Federal Council Of Adelart"
HEL_switzerland_desc:0 "While direct democracy does provide our populace the most fair and equal way of participating in the governance of the state, certain examples of direct democracy across Griffonia have shown the problems such a system causes it's relied upon too much. Therefore a federal council will be established in order to take care of issues that are too minor for the entire populace of Adelart to consider."

HEL_gun_rights:0 "A Gun For Every Griffon"
HEL_gun_rights_desc:0 "20 years ago the griffons of Adelart declared independence from the Greifwald tyrants in a popular uprising. Even now the overlords of Greifwald look at us with hunger in their eyes. If our democracy is to survive, the populace must be armed and ready to defend their liberty and rights."

HEL_support_the_old_believers:0 "Autonomy For The Temples"
HEL_support_the_old_believers_desc:0 "The majority of the population of Adelart is comprised of highly religious griffons. While we already support the religious communities within our country, they are somewhat neutral towards our government. This is why we will increase support to the religious communities in order to become friends with them."

HEL_decentralized_education:0 "Autonomous Education System"
HEL_decentralized_education_desc:0 "For a democratic, especially directly democratic, system to work, the populace needs to be knowledgeable enough to realize what is best for them. This is why we must ensure that every griffon in Adelart has the ability to achieve higher education, even if it's in somewhat unorthodox methods."

HEL_encourage_communal_lifestyles:0 "A Communal Society"
HEL_encourage_communal_lifestyles_desc:0 "There are many small towns and groups of villages that are scattered across the forests and plains of Adelart. Many of them are suffering from grave issues, which our government is simply unable to help them due to the libertarian nature of our country. Thus it would be a better and more beneficial solution to encourage self-governance through a communal system."

HEL_distance_from_extremism:0 "Distance From The Extremists"
HEL_distance_from_extremism_desc:0 "While Adelart has been accused of being radicals and lunatics by many foreigners and even some elements within our country, these claims are mostly absurd and laughable. However, in some cases they are correct... There are indeed heavily extremist elements within our society and politics. And we cannot allow such lunatics to run rampant."

HEL_eyrian_socialism:0 "Eyrian Socialism"
HEL_eyrian_socialism_desc:0 "The griffons of Adelart, be they from the rural or the urban environment, are highly religious. Not to them is the animosity or even hartred of faith and the divine, present among so many other socialist philosophies. Our socialism is not simply based on the material realm, but is also inspired by that which is divine - by the faith in the Goddess Eyr."

HEL_left_nationalism:0 "Left Nationalism"
HEL_left_nationalism_desc:0 "Adelart is and will hopefully always will be a realm of socialist workers and farmers. However, differently from most socialist workers, the griffons of Adelart do not see themselves as part of some international group. Rather they choose to still identify with the Adelartian culture. This has been our strenght in previous struggles and hopefully will be our strenght in future ones."

HEL_the_first_unions:0 "The First Unions"
HEL_the_first_unions_desc:0 "Adelart has never been an industrialized region. Due to this, the idea of trade unions never caught on among the inhabitants of Adelart. This might be the reason why the commuanl system lacks effect in more urban regions. Helping to establish worker unions based on the rural tradition of old believer worker associations might lead to an improvement of this situation."

### Events ###
adelart.1.t:0 "The 20th Congress Of Peoples and Peasants"
adelart.1.d:0 ""Come one come all to the great congress of the People! Where all shall be heard and none will ignored! For our nation is built upon these great pledges that all shall be recognized and all shall have a voice!"\n\nThese words opened the national congress for the 20th year in a row this year. Griffons from all about gathered to speak their voice, and everyone had something to say. From simple disputes to national policy, nothing dominated the discussion as much as the issue of how the nation should be run. This debate has been hanging in the air for a while now, and Merlock Wood has been trying to pin down a solution. And it seems now in his 20th year as leader, he will finally force the hand of all the Congress' factions to give him their arguments straight.\n\nFirst, the anarchists, his old compatriots, and brothers. Who believe that the nation should continue as it has, with some reforms and changes, of course. But that their traditions of liberty and freedom will hold them high as they always have. And none can or should take that away from any of the people!\n\nSecond come the Liberals. They talk of the great truths of the republic, and point out the evident and apparent flaws with the current anarchist system. "No one even listens to you anymore!", they proclaim to great disapproval before Merlock raises a claw. They are heard out by the Congress before departing. Having made their point very clear.\n\nLastly come the socialists. Dressed in military regalia or industrial outfits, they speak of the world beyond the woods, and mythical states like "Stalliongrad" who build great Utopias for the workers. And that the nation must come together and centralize under a worker's model of government if all of us are to survive.\n\nThough, as with every congress. The final choice comes to the dear Protector of the nation. What shall Merlock do?"
adelart.1.a:0 "The congress decides to continue the anarchist tradition."
adelart.1.b:0 "The congress decides to reform into a liberal democracy."
adelart.1.c:0 "The congress decides to centralize into a vanguard party."

adelart.2.t:0 "Democracy In The Forests"
adelart.2.d:0 "Merlock Wood sat on the edge of his wooden rocking chair in his forest abode, far far away from the vestiges of government that he must now decide what to do with. He knew his ideal model could not survive. That pure anarchism could not be the way to go forward any longer.\n\nBut what of the rights and liberties that he had fought so long to protect? What of the little griffons who wanted to have their own voice?\n\nWhat will come of their freedom? He sat pondering and thinking over every choice he had to make before he reached a moment of lucidity...\n\nNothing. Nothing would happen to their freedom. He could build a true republic, not like those that were chained by monstrous bureaucratic messes. But one that truly worked for the people. Each citizen for the nation, and the nation for all its citizens."
adelart.2.a:0 "Liberty and democracy!"

adelart.3.t:0 "A Meeting Deep In The Woods"
adelart.3.d:0 "Merlock Wood sat grumbling in a decrepit old house deep in the countryside.\n\n"The Clergy..." he muttered "Why do I have to deal with the Clergy..?"\n\nMerlock was not an impious griffon by any means, he paid heed to the gods as any religious griff did. He just always chafed with the balance of the power of the Clergy in his lands... and now it was coming to a head with his choice to centralize the state into a republic, which was disliked by many members of the Clergy who wished to maintain their right to govern themselves.\n\nAnd on top of that?! He didn't know who he was meeting with. At this point it could be anyone. He trusted them enough for them not to try to assassinate him or anything. But it wouldn't be the first time someone had tried, and failed, to do that. Merlock knew that this issue had to be settled once and for all or his nation would never be able to become the democracy it was meant to be.\n\nA knock? Who will it be?\n\nAs Merlock opened the door, he began to smile. Standing before him was the priest known merely as "Luca vun Lissay".\n\nHe could work with this griff."
adelart.3.a:0 "Nice to see you again, Luca"

adelart.4.t:0 "Rallying The Democrats"
adelart.4.d:0 "The first thing Wood did after his decision for democracy was to begin to call in the various elements he knew he would need to court to build stability for his nation.\n\n First of these were those Liberals who all spoke at the council. He would make them aware of his intentions and try to rally them to assist him in his new efforts to reform the nation.\n\nMessangers ran out across the country from Eagleton and far beyond to gather as many members of the Liberal communities as possible to try to form up a new proto-government, to prepare for the day when elections will be held properly."
adelart.4.a:0 "Democracy will come to Adelart!"

adelart.5.t:0 "Securing The Forest Brothers"
adelart.5.d:0 "When Merlock Wood assumed full leadership over Adelhart, he abdicated leadership of his mercenary group the "Forest Brothers" to a trusted friend nicknamed Lil Bron.\n\nThey remained in a low profile to hide from those forces that would root out their tendency to cause a little thing called "Liberty".\n\nSo Merlock ventured out alone to the deepest parts of the forest to put up their ancient signal. He knew not how they would find him and return to Adelart, but he knew they would. As he took the black powder and threw it over the ancient spruce while carving the sigil of the Brothers into the trunk, he thought about how he wanted to see them all again, and how much he could use their help. To finish the call, he took out the burning twig of a mulberry bush and tossed it onto the tree, producing a deep purple smoke for all of his brothers to see.\n\nA rustling in the trees?! Merlock grabbed his rifle, ready to defend himself one last time, but before he could draw fully, an arrow struck the pouch out of his hand. And a figure emerged from the treeline...\n\n"Hey Merlock." The enormous griffon spoke with a comforting tone, "I knew you would need us back eventually." "
adelart.5.a:0 "Damn it Bron, you almost gave me a heart attack..."

adelart.6.t:0 "Convincing The Anarchists"
adelart.6.d:0 "With the Liberals and his old friends behind him, Merlock now had to embark on his greatest quest of all. Getting the anarchists to be... well less anarchist. They would hold a great convention in the old Sherif's building, a symbolic home of the revolution in Adelart and hammer out the policy. The presence of the Liberal politicians and the great heroes of the revolution really took some pressure off of Merlock's shoulders. As he could simply let them all talk, so he didn't have to speak down to his comrades. He knew what needed to be done. Now they just had to be convinced."
adelart.6.a:0 "See! Representative democracy is good!"

adelart.7.t:0 "The Dawn Of True Democracy"
adelart.7.d:0 "With the Liberals, the Clergy, and the Anarchists all general on board with the whole "normal democracy" thing, we can now finally come together for elections in our nation.\n\nAs soon as Merlock got everyone to Eagleton, the most experienced among them had to explain the concept of a "political party" to some of the delegates in attendance. But once that initial hurdle had been crossed, three parties emerged for the voters of Adelart to pick from. First, the Anarchists and far left Liberals banded together to form the Socialist party, campaigning to keep up with the modern labor standards of the nation and to keep much of the traditional attitudes of decentralized power. They have a strong base of support primarily in the 20 years of the revolutionary history of the nation.\n\nMany of the Liberals have also come together under the Social-Democratic party to put forward a more traditional republican government for the country. They promise more centralization and have support mainly from the new middle class and griffons not so enthused with the revolution twenty years prior.\n\nLastly are the Borean conservatives. A party backed by many religious parties in the nation and promising to put the Gods first in national policy. With that comes many things but the primary support for the party comes from the backing of Luca vun Lissay.\n\nOf course through every party has agreed that Merlock Wood will remain the head of state due to his importance overall.\n\nWho shall win the elections?"
adelart.7.a:0 "The Socialist Coalition!"
adelart.7.b:0 "The Social Democrats!"
adelart.7.c:0 "The Eyrist Conservatives!"

adelart.8.t:0 "A Peaceful Resolution?"
adelart.8.d:0 "Merlock wood sat in his bedroom, tapping at his desk with a pen, he was trying to think of how to go forward from here. A plan of action was needed to usher the Free Territory into the new future of anarchism.\n\nOr perhaps... a plan of inaction? For twenty years he had led the nation by taking action when it was needed, and sitting back and doing near nothing when it wasn't required. What if he could apply this same idea to his situation in the present day? Gentle pushes here and there, but generally allowing the towns to do as they need to fix their own issues.\n\nHuh, nothing never sounded so good."
adelart.8.a:0 "All we need is peace, love, and cooperation, right?"

adelart.9.t:0 "Mobilizing The Militias"
adelart.9.d:0 ""
adelart.9.a:0 "Time to root out these enemies of freedom."

adelart.10.t:0 "On The Matters Of The Sheriff"
adelart.10.d:0 "A specter stalks Adelhard... it is the dark memory of the sheriff's reign over the land, and how he suppressed all the freedoms of the people. And yet many still support his return, mainly based on that crazy concept called "monarchy".\n\nLately our policy of not interfering with many of the communities in the nation has brought to the front some of those who do support this return. And now we must decide our path of action...\n\nWe could easily send in some troops to try to disperse these communities, though this does go against much of what we believe.\n\nAlternatively, we could try to convince them of our benefits by investing in their regions to show our good grace to them as citizens. Though they could turn this aginst us...\n\nOr... we could do nothing. Let the fools burn themselves out, or burn us up...\n\nWhat to choose?"
adelart.10.a:0 "It would be undemocratic to take direct or indirect action."
adelart.10.b:0 "Perhaps some local development will bring them back to the cause?"
adelart.10.c:0 "Are we mad? Send in the troops to these disloyal communities!"

adelart.11.t:0 "An Industrial Grant"
adelart.11.d:0 "We have made our decision to invest in the rebel regions and so see where that gets us with their loyalty. Now the only choice is what we should do. A simple thing would be to build more roads to carry ideas and, if needed, troops to the region, which will connect them to Adelart as a whole. Though, many of the areas loyal to the Sheriff are religious communities, if we were to build a new temple, they might be easily swayed to our side."
adelart.11.a:0 "Build a couple of new roads."
adelart.11.b:0 "Build a new temple to the three Gods."

adelart.12.t:0 "Pro-Greifwald Activity Increases"
adelart.12.d:0 "Mixed reports are coming in... but it seems our efforts have backfired. Activities in support of the sheriff's return have increased in our nation. We must be careful of how we proceed from this point onwards..."
adelart.12.a:0 "Oops."

adelart.13.t:0 "Making Our Move"
adelart.13.d:0 "The choice has been made that we shall send in armed forces to remove the supporters of the sheriff from their communities and restore order. Now we must decide how we go about this. An easy and straightforward way to go through with the plan would be to hire a passing group of mercenaries to get the dirty work done for us, and to ensure none of our citizens fall in the effort. The downside being well... they are mercenaries. The alternative is our own citizen soldiers, though deaths in this operation could cause great pain to our prestige."
adelart.13.a:0 "Hire a cheap mercenary band to root them out."
adelart.13.b:0 "Raise a popular militia brigade to bring them to justice."

adelart.14.t:0 "Our Mercenaries Defect!"
adelart.14.d:0 "Terrible news! It appears the Sheriff himself has been found... but in the worst way. It seems he had a large reserve of cash lying around and has bribed our mercenaries to serve with him instead of taking down his rebellious communities. They are now emboldened against our government. We must be cautious..."
adelart.14.a:0 "Why did we trust them??!!"

adelart.15.t:0 "Decrease In Pro-Sheriff Activity"
adelart.15.d:0 "Our efforts have borne fruit. It appears efforts to support the sheriff have taken a steep decline recently. We may now sleep a bit safer.\n\nAnd maybe without guns under our pillows."
adelart.15.a:0 "Excellent."

adelart.16.t:0 "The Issue Of Decentralization"
adelart.16.d:0 "With our non-involvement policy we must now decide to what degree that shall go. We already have prolific decentralization throughout our nation, and only some of the most far flung, miniscule, and unimportant communities do not yet have a full role in teh coices of the nation. We could easily rectify this, but do we really want to spread our control that thin? We could easily keep the current system as well. Which would keep our citizens content."
adelart.16.a:0 "Some townships STILL don't have a voice!"
adelart.16.b:0 "I think our current level is just fine..."

adelart.19.d:0 "The day was peaceful, and the forest birds sang as the sun rose on order's victory. The Sherif of Adelart sat content. His job had been done, and he had restored order to this rouge province of his. Now he shall return it to the Count one way or another, and all shall be well.\n\nA Knock? Who could it be this early in the morning?\n\nA nervous page sat wriggling in his leather boots outside the door, "Sir, sir sheriff?" he seemed squeamish as he spoke the frantic words. "There is uhh... a priest here to see you."\n\n"Ah yes! The servants of the gods are here to thank me for removing that dirty criminal from their lands!" the Sheriff spoke with bravado, he was happy, he had always been faithful to Boreas above, and that loyalty was finally coming back to repay him.\n\nHe pushed past the page and moved along, grabbing his wide-brimmed hat along the way. Though as he neared the door, he began to hear an ominous chanting from outside... what could that be? As he exited the building that served as his headquarters, he bore witness to a truly shocking thing.\n\nTens and tens of griffons in the robes of peasants lined up with various relics in their hands, chanting in unison prayers and hymns unknown to the prelates in Griffenheim, or the Sheriff's ears. But most of all, what shocked the usually steely griffon, where he met his match, was the behemoth of steel that sat in the middle of the field. And stepping to the top, a griffon dressed in the cloth of a peasant man holding an ancient reliquary.\n\n"Godless demon of Adelart! You defile the people's right and bend before the corrupters of the gods! You rob us of our belief, and so we rob you of your power! The true believers shall have a home once more! For Boreas who guides us! Eyr who feeds us, and Arcturus who sends you to damnation!"\n\nEyr has come to Adelart."

adelart.29.d:0 "While Merlook Wood and his comrades strive to maintain a decentralized system of governance where every griffon can truly decide how to live in this socialist society by themselves, not all prominent, allegedly, socialist ideologues and local figures within the borders of Adelart maintain the same mentality. These so called “Vanguardists” cast a shadow across the country, trying to convince the workers and farmers of Adelart that a strong socialist state is needed to create a true utopia of the lower classes. These extremist madmen desire to turn Adelart into but another Stalliongrad or Prywhen, a shackled state, even if robed in red.\n\nWhile these agitators and extremists were initially willing to seek a compromise with more anarchist and libertarian elements within the movement which would lead to the independence of Adelart and has now coalesced into the socialist coalition, and even helped with the original rebellion against the tyrant sheriff and his Greifwaldian overlords, this has changed. While some claim that the actions of these vanguardists, even if somewhat widespread, wouldn’t have any effect on the country and it’s inhabitants. After all they didn’t have the effect in the last few decades, so what would change now? However, Merlook Wood is unwilling to just allow this to continue, especially now that these extremists are far more prominent and even willing to criticize the current system as “betrayal of the socialist ideal” and the ruling coalition.\n\nThus, even with heavy heart, the Woodists drove the statist extremists out of any and all leadership positions, and even in some cases, pushed them out beyond the borders of Adelart with force of arms."
adelart.29.a:0 "A commendable move."
adelart.30.t:0 "The Principle of Left Nationalism"
adelart.30.d:0 "While many other socialist thinkers and leaders believed and promoted the idea that the working class does not have a nation. They claimed that nations are but arbitrary constructs, yet another symptom of the eternal conflict between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. However, the hero of the Adelartian revolution and war of independence, Merlock Wood, does not hold the same opinion. After all socialism was an Equestrian ideology in origin, created in a realm where most citizens perceived themselves as part of a whole, a single realm forged millenniums ago. Griffonia and the kingdoms and empires that rose were forged through violence, subjugation and even in many cases destruction of languages and cultures.\n\nWith such historical circumstances it would seem truly absurd for griffon socialists to desire to abandon their culture, language and in many cases faith. After all in Griffonia, it’s the bourgeoisie that seek such destruction, while the proletariat, the farmers and workers, desire to maintain these ties. Thus it could be argued, and Merlock Wood and his allies do, that in the context of Griffonia, nationalism isn’t a symbol of radical right, rather it can also be the symbol of the workers liberation. After all it was this cultural association, together with the old believer faith that, based on which the workers of Adelart were so ready to mobilize against the oppressors from Greifwald.\n\nFurthermore, while most socialists are heavily utopian in their beliefs and think that some sort of hypothetical continental or even world socialist republic would be equal in fair to all, we are sceptical of such outcomes. After all, without any differentiation or inner borders, does that not mean that even in a socialist state, richer and more developed regions would simply dominate the lesser ones?"

Although he was succeeded by two daughters, none took up his family name, and soon after his death, his home was sold off to the local peasant assembly to become cooperative housing for the small town's urban residents. His funeral was attended only by his closest friends and government minister Harriet Roberts, who had taken an interest in Adelart's heirs, even at one point asking Wood to re-instate the Sweetsingers for nationalistic and politcial gain.\n\nWith Leonald's death, whatever remained of centuries-old monarchist groups in Adelart has dissapated, and vanguardists have taken the event to be a sign that monarchists will soon serve the sheriff and Greifwaldian exile groups, ordering Wood to take action and drive the sheriff's supporters from Adelart.\n\nAlthough Leonald's death was sadly politicized by the Congress of People and Peasants, it was a bitter end for a dynasty that had longed to rule Adelart again for hundreds of years. Now, the Sweetsingers will be ruling no county, and the dynasty that went from counts to peasants has finally ended."

###LEADERS###
jacob_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 13th of April, 974 in Conard\n\n§YBiography§!: Jacob de Conard was 6 when the Adelartian Revolution broke out, and the bonds that tied them to the ancient monarchy of Greifwald were forever broken. But to think that Jacob ever stayed in Adelart with its new collectivist government in power would be wildly incorrect. His family, mostly capitalists loyal to the County of Greifwald, moved to Flowena, at that point suffering from its own declaration of independence from Pomovarra. De Conard, a quick learner and ruthless capitalist, soon rose through the ranks of Flowena's school system, graduating with a degree in economics.\n\nAfter his brief stint in Flowena, De Conard soon moved to Conard, in Adelart, his old home, where he campaigned for the end of the "peasant's government" of Merlock Wood and the fall of "tyrannical collectivism". Soon, De Conard helped to found the Conard Academy Of Arts And Sciences, and took a brief job as a designer for the Adelartian army, creating budget versions of Imperial tanks, but none of his jobs truly spoke to him.\n\n.In 1003, blessed with a unique opportunity, De Conard began talks with the Flowenan government about a possible takeover in Adelart - to ensure that the vast oil reserves of the Lissay were entrusted to loyal and hard-working griffons. While Flowena pulled the strings behind Adelart's new democratic reforms, unbeknownst to even the government, De Conard watched and waited until his time to strike - and now, Adelart is his.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Kessel"
merlock_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 11th of May, 959 in Bergelun\n\n§YBiography§!: Merlock Wood is called many things. Traitor, bandit, murderer, hero, protector - but none can deny that he is a revolutionary above all. Wood started his revolutionary career as a little-known partisan of the First Adelartian Revolution of 983, when Jan Roycen, a famed outlaw, first inspired the people of Adelart to break the shackles of both Greifwalder and Aquileian rule, and establish a free independent territory. After Roycen found his rebellion crushed and himself beheaded, Wood took up the torch of the Adelartian revolutionaries, restructuring them among collectivist and fiercely anti-monarchist lines, with the promise of redistribution of wealth for the people and justice upon the corrupt nobles in each and every town they conquered.\n\nGreifwald, controlled by a weak and inefficient count, was beset by an Adelartian revolution that gained most of their strongholds peacefully through the people's will, with Wood's revolutionary ideals at its helm. The Sheriff, Willam Wendenal, failed to quell the revolt, with his own trusted griffons betraying him for the promise of wealth and freedom. He was beheaded soon after, and replaced by Jean Nottemagne, who reluctantly fled Adelart for good.\n\nMerlock began to re-organize the government upon libertarian, collectivist, and populist lines, with particular fury directed toward the Archonates and the Prelature of Greifwald, who suffered massive reprisals and murders at the hand of Wood's guerrilla armies. Fiercely anti-authoritarian attitudes among the revolutionaries, along with a hatred of what they believed was maarite corruption in the chrch, led to Wood embracing the old believers, a fringe religious sect, and shaking hands with the new "Elected Prelate", Luca vun Lissay.\n\nWhile Wood has ruled for 20 years with relative stability, the people are growing restless. Hardliners clamour for Wood's removal and trial for banditry and mass murder and the establishment of true socialism, while moderates call for the end of the revolutionary period and the establishment of real democracy. If Wood is to stay, only time will tell.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

Some, the most devout loyalists to the Old Believer cause, say he was placed upon the forests of Adelart by the Gods themselves, given to a local temple to become a prophet of Eyr herself and bring down the lie of the Archonate. Even the skeptics can say little of his background - with no known parents or familial connections, Luca vun Lissay was raised by the faith, bestowing upon him a fanatic devotion to the Gods and faith - and a skepticism of the Archonate's methods that would linger for the rest of his life.\n\nSo far has the cult of personality of Luca vun Lissay risen that he has now been proclaimed the "True Prelate of Greifwald" by his supporters, despite the hierarchical hyprocrisy that the name entails. The ragged, aging priest has become a becaon of hope for the people of Adelart, and after the post-revolutionary purges of Ebonwing's loyalists, now remains the only legitimate temporal authority in the wayward province.\n\nMerlock Wood spared his sect and gave them their power, and now, Luca vun Lissay himself has taken his place.

Instead, the Archons shall be chosen by the people of Griffonia as a whole, as prelates and priests scour the nation for griffons who truly understand the faith and are ready for the burden of power.
