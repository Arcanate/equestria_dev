### Ideas ###
HEL_fanatic_decentralization:0 "Decentralization - Fanatic"
HEL_fanatic_decentralization_desc:0 "Every township, community, and union has a place in the poltiics of Adelart and should be listened to. Our government was made to carry out the wishes of the peasants and people of Adelart, and every township has a voice at the national level. This decentralization has led to unprecented stability as each town feels like they have a say, but unfortunately, it has also caused political turmoil as major economic and political initiatives cannot be passed through many communities. This has led to the creation of many outright hostile communities that halt our political efforts by vetoing any processes to bring revolutionary ideology into their territory."
HEL_moderate_decentralization:0 "Decentralization - Moderate"
HEL_moderate_decentralization_desc:0 "Our nation is still decentralized, but now, it is much less inefficient. We still have stable, democratic, traditions, and now our government can actually carry out the interests with the people without being vetoed by governments."
HEL_legacy_of_the_revolution:0 "Populace - §GPatriotic§!"
HEL_legacy_of_the_revolution_desc:0 "20 years ago, our people declared independence from the corrupt County of Griefwald, and overthrew the Sheriff, the governor appointed by the Count to oppress our people and carry out the wishes of the nobility! Our people are dedicated to prevent this from ever happening again, with an almost fanatical devotion to Merlock Wood and the concept of revolution as a whole. We will never again be slaves to the Sheriff and his corrupt Greifwaldian overlords!"
HEL_chaotic_government:0 "Government - §RChaotic§!"
HEL_chaotic_government_desc:0 "Our government has always been based on the principles of democracy, liberty, and equality for all peasants and citizens of Adelart. Unfortunately, the situation has not developed completely to our advantage. With many communities disregarding the whims of our govermnent and pursuing their own policies, decentralization has almost completely backfired. Our people's devotion to revolution has led to a rise of authoritarian socialist movements believing that our revolutionary harbinger, Merlock Wood, is a bourgeois puppet! With the church controlling many small, hostile communities and authoritarian socialists plotting revolution against our already socialist government, Merlock Wood's position is in turmoil. And above all that, some speak of the Sheriff making a move to return..."
HEL_unstable_government:0 "Government - §RUnstable§!"
HEL_unstable_government_desc:0 "While our government has somewhat recovered from its chaotic days, we still have instability, and if a party was to leave our coalition, we would surely have a chaotic govermnent on our hands."
HEL_fairly_stable_government:0 "Govermnent - §YModerately Stable§!"
HEL_fairly_stable_government_desc:0 "Our government has a majority in our legislature and has over 50% approval rates, but it has no more than that. While we are still in control of our government and citizens, we could do better, and our government is susceptible to possible instability if certain events occur."
HEL_autonomous_religious_communities:0 "Religious Communities - §YContent§!"
HEL_autonomous_religious_communities_desc:0 "During the revolution, religious communities in Greifwald and Adelart stayed largely neutral, and after the revolution was won and democracy was established in Adelart, these same communities were given substantial autonomy and influence. Now, religious communities are largely exempt to Adelartian law and have priveleges of their own, forcing what little government we have to allocate extra money to their churches and townships. However, the churches do inspire unity in our territory, and unlike many other socialist republics, our people are pious and devout, always keeping the teachings of Boreas in their mind."
HEL_moderate_church_support:0 "Religious Communities - §GSupportive§!"
HEL_moderate_church_support_desc:0 "The Clergy are very autonomous and have begun to support our regime in their goals. They are happy with the current state of Adelart."
HEL_moderate_church_anger:0 "Religious Communities - §RAnnoyed§!"
HEL_moderate_church_anger_desc:0 "The Clergy have had their autonomy stripped away angry at our current measures to limit their autonomy. If we go to far with our anti-Church measures, they could coup the government."
