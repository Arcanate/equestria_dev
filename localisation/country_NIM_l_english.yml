 nimbusia.2.d:0 "After a passionate debate on ethics, where the actual question at hand was often out of sight due to lengthy allegories and examples, it is up to the Ecclesia to determine what to do with the silver.

However, as always, many citizens thought of the immediate benefits of expanding industry and creating more jobs."

 nimbusia.3.d:0 "The Boule’s sessions went together with a spike in anti-foreigner sentiment, especially in the countryside. Now that the deliberations are done, the people have to decide.

 nimbusia.4.d:0 "The deliberations in the Boule invigorated debates about the destiny of the Akropolis of Nimbusi. For a long time, it was the pride of the country, but budget cuts and negligence left the highest point of the city a shadow of its former self. A lot of soldiers support the idea of a temple to the gods of war, while many older citizens seek to restore the Akropolis. Some of the youngsters, however, consider the project a waste of time and would rather see infrastructure be made with the money."

 ### NIM_silver_mines debate
 nimbusia.8.t_harmony:0 "Ponetagoras orates about Value"
 nimbusia.8.t_neutrality:0 "Demarescios orates about Prudence"
 nimbusia.8.t_fascism:0 "Speushippos orates about Bravery"
 nimbusia.8.d_harmony:0 "The Boule was baffled by Ponetagoras, the orator hired by the reformist faction. On the silver debate, he presented a lengthy story to proof his point. In it, when asked to keep their master’s money safe as he leaves to fight, two slaves handle the question very differently. One buries his master’s possessions, hiring guards to keep it all safe. The other slave, used the funds to invest in the polis. When the master comes back, he scolds the slave who buried his silver while praising the one that invested the money and turned a profit.\n\nThe Boule applauded Ponetagoras, who graciously bowed. Without even mentioning the actual events once, the orator managed to swing the Boule to the reformist position."
 nimbusia.8.d_neutrality:0 "Speaking slowly and deliberately, Demarescios, the philosopher of the traditionalist faction, gave a moving statement to the Boule. Recalling many tumultuous events in our history, the old pegasus asked at the end of every historical retelling; “How much of this would have been avoided if our ancestors had silver for emergencies?”\n\nAt the end the Boule’s members almost unanimously agreed with Demarescios that the silver should be saved. However, the issue was still up for a vote in the Ecclesia, the citizens’ assembly."
 nimbusia.8.d_fascism:0 "Speushippos addressed the Boule with great confidence. Completely foregoing rhetoric about saving or investing, the pegasus instead focused on a battle he knew he could win. Speushippos talked at length about the many conversations he had with soldiers and even generals about bravery. Bravery, then, was a virtue naturally in the middle between foolhardiness and cowardice. Of course Nimbusia’s soldiers could never be accused of cowardice, but what of foolhardiness? Was going in to battle with outdated guns and without modern equipment foolhardy? Speushippos left it to the others to contemplate that question.\n\nWhen the philosopher was done, the Boule voted to recommend the Ecclesia to vote for a military investment program!"
 nimbusia.8.a_good:0 "That’s why I hired you!"
 nimbusia.8.a_bad:0 "Our message didn’t get through..."
 nimbusia.8.b_good:0 "Demarescios speaks wisely!"
 nimbusia.8.b_bad:0 "They seek to squander our wealth."
 nimbusia.8.c_good:0 "Speushippos knows what matters!"
 nimbusia.8.c_bad:0 "Weaklings..."
 ### NIM_city_culture debate
 nimbusia.9.t_harmony:0 "Ponetagoras pleads Innocence"
 nimbusia.9.t_neutrality:0 "Demarescios sees the Polis as a Group of Friends"
 nimbusia.9.t_fascism:0 "Speushippos on the State"
 nimbusia.9.d_harmony:0 "Ponetagoras had made a name by taking up causes that seemed all but lost. With arguments, clever use of words and sheer charisma, he has gotten many ponies acquitted in his career. His opponents knew this and tried all sorts of disruptive tricks to prevent the reformist from speaking. However, the Boule’s praesidium caught on to this and allowed Ponetagoras to deliver his oration.\n\nThe philosopher started praising Nimbusian wine and by weaving myth and reality together, he suggested that Nimbusian wine was indeed ambrosia, the drink of the Gods! Even most of his opponents had to admit that saying otherwise would be blasphemy. And that was precisely what Ponetagoras wanted to hear. Continuing his argument, the pegasus argued that the Wittenlanders, tasting the divine drink, were merely possessed by the divine spirit. Any actions committed while ‘drunk’ were then merely the will of the Gods. To go against that would be blasphemy as well. Therefore, the Wittenlanders were only guilty for obeying the Gods of Nimbusia!\nAt the end of the day, the Boule had to agree with the reformists . . ."
 nimbusia.9.d_neutrality:0 "The traditionalists had to pull a couple of tricks to stop the famed reformist lawyer Ponetagoras from speaking. By using some procedural changes, they managed to postpone the reformists’ speech by a day, while being able to have Demarescios give his oration today.  In it, the wise pony first stated that the crimes the foreigners committed were light, but the repercussions were large. A society was a close kinship of friends and it could only remain virtuous if the friends trusted each other. The Wittenlanders had broken the trust of the Polis and therefore had to leave the circle of friends.\n\nDemarescios reiterated again, that the group of friends needed to be careful about who to let in, as to keep the group’s traditions alive. He said that he bore no ill will against the Wittenlanders, but that they had to be politely instructed to leave Nimbusia. The Boule, then, found themselves agreeing on this, skipping the pleas of the other factions."
 nimbusia.9.d_fascism:0 "Speushippos managed to secure the stage in front of the Boule for himself. His speech roused the representatives with nationalist fervour. Indeed, the pegasi state had been the protector of the Riverponies since ancient times. But the unicorns of Wittenland, instead of being grateful, used the peace we paid for with our blood to feast and drink. To add insult to injury, the Wittenlanders brought their wasteful nature to Nimbusia. If the ponies of Nimbusia were to continue to respect our laws, the government had to make a point. Arrest the unicorns!\n\nAt this point much of the Boule was riled up and emotional, many did not expect Speushippos to use rhetoric, a form of arguing his master Palton despised. While the emotional Boule members drafted a warrant to be voted on by the Ecclesia, the more astute political minds of the country wondered whether Speushippos was not getting influenced more by his patron, Andreia."
 nimbusia.9.a_good:0 "A brilliant piece of oration!"  
 nimbusia.9.a_bad:0 "Trying to get their way over our friends’ backs, bah."
 nimbusia.9.b_good:0 "We should be careful, indeed."
 nimbusia.9.b_bad:0 "Radicals!"
 nimbusia.9.c_good:0 "We should arrest the Xenoi."
 nimbusia.9.c_bad:0 "The other factions are Proxenoi!"

### NIM_renovate_acropolis debate
 nimbusia.10.t_harmony:0 "Misuse of Funds is Murder"
 nimbusia.10.t_neutrality:0 "Honouring the Gods"
 nimbusia.10.t_fascism:0 "The Temple of War"
 nimbusia.10.d_harmony:0 "The reformists had taken the radical standpoint that the Akropolis should not receive any extra funds. Ponetagoras had the unenviable task to defend this to the Boule, which was mostly in favour of the renovation. When the orator took the stage, he began his talk like he often did, with something seemingly unrelated. Using numbers, he had gathered, Ponetagoras gave a sketch of poverty in the country, even amongst citizens. In fact, the hardships even led to some untimely deaths. With that he came to the Akropolis. Although he praised its beauty and the noble cause of renovation the complex, he had to admit that the state should have other priorities. Now that the Boule knew about the plight of the poorest citizens, could it really justify this prestige project?\n\nRepresentatives from the other parties cried foul, arguing that Ponetagoras was using emotional arguments, but the damage had been done. Many of the councillors indeed knew poorer ponies who were having difficulty scraping together a living. With those images in their mind, they voted to recommend the Ecclesia to use the money on economic means instead."
 nimbusia.10.d_neutrality:0 "Demarescios’s faction had choses to support a restoration of the Akropolis, the ancient complex of temples sitting atop the highest point of the city of Nimbusi. This debate was an easy one for the philosopher, since most of the Boule was already on his hand. The pony merely recounted the ancient founding of the city and how the Gods themselves were responsible for choosing this site for the city. To worship and respect the Gods then, was to ensure prosperity for the city and the country at large.\n\nWhen the other philosophers tried to counter his arguments, Demarescios brought out an old document that was recovered from the archives. In it, the architect of the original works, all those years ago, recounted that he asked the Oracle for advice on the Akropolis’s construction and that the Oracle answered that the way it is now would please the Gods greatly. With that revelation, the traditionalist arguments won out in the Boule!"
 nimbusia.10.d_fascism:0 "Speushippos had grand dreams of a state in which everypony was told about a natural order of rulers, soldiers and people. Where everypony would live in harmony and stability. His master Palton taught that to achieve this, the citizens had to be deceived to keep the system in place. Of course lying to the citizenry and instituting a dictatorship weren’t the reasons he gave to build a ‘Temple of War’. Instead, Speushippos gave a considered speech where he compared the Gods of Nimbusia and he openly asked the Boule which of them deserved the most reverence by getting a place on the Akropolis.\n\nOf course the philosopher answered his own question by going down the list. The State can only exist, he argued, because of the blessings of the gods of war. Without them, a country would surely be overrun by its enemies. Although the other Gods help make the state what it is, primacy should be given to its protectors. Therefore, the Gods of War deserved the highest spot on the city. Although the other philosophers considered this a thinly veiled attempt to put the military on a pedestal, the Boule was convinced by Speushippos’s logic and accepted his proposal."
 nimbusia.10.a_good:0 "A bit extreme, but accurate."
 nimbusia.10.a_bad:0 "What a waste of money!"
 nimbusia.10.b_good:0 "The Gods smile upon us."

 #The Boule political path
 NIM_choose_harmony:0 "Support the Reformist Cause"
 NIM_choose_harmony_desc:0 "Although Metakeros, a wealthy unicorn merchant, served in the army and gained citizenship, many non-pegasi did not get the chance. In the Boule, he has gathered some support to reform Nimbusian society into one where non-pegasi and non-soldiers will also be represented fairly. To represent the reformist cause, the unicorn has decided to hire the services of a well-known orator..."

 NIM_choose_neutrality:0 "Protecting Tradition"
 NIM_choose_neutrality_desc:0 "Pegalaios, an older and well respected pegasus is the spokesstallion for a group of ponies called the traditionalists. They see Nimbusia’s ancient traditions and values as the cornerstone of the state. Seeking to have the state run by ancient virtues such as justice and bravery, Pegalaios hopes to steer the Boule away from radical change. On his side, the veteran turned politician a follower of Aristrotle called Demarescios."

 NIM_choose_fascism:0 "Fight for Strength"
 NIM_choose_fascism_desc:0 "Andreia, a young officer in the army, heads the purist faction. They argue that the Boule makes Nimbusia indecisive and vulnerable. She has rallied many young pegasi to her side, who seek to claim their right as undisputed rulers of Nimbusia. To accomplish this, Andreia allied herself with the philosopher Speushippos, who forged the radical ideas in Palton’s ‘Republic’ into an antidemocratic platform."

 NIM_boule_deliberates:0 "The Boule Deliberates"
 NIM_boule_deliberates_desc:0 "The Boule, the citizens’ assembly, is the beating heart of Nimbusian democracy. But the citizens of Nimbusi can’t seem to agree on anything. With both reformists and purists seeking to break the status quo, even the smallest issues turn into an ideological struggle. However, the chaos is an opportunity for ambitious ponies to steer the citizenry with the ancient skill of rhetoric..."

 NIM_what_to_grow:0 "What to grow?"
 NIM_what_to_grow_desc:0 "The mountainous terrain of Nimbusia is ill-suited to farm grain and other foods. Olives and wine would be better candidates, but that would make Nimbusia reliant on foreign trade. This small question has erupted into a matter of principle about the direction of the country, with reformists favouring wine, traditionalists being pro-olive and purists insiting on grain."

 NIM_silver_mines:0 "Speaking of Silver"
 NIM_silver_mines_desc:0 "Recently, the Gods have blessed us with the discovery of a large vein of silver. These riches sit unused, however, since the Boule cannot decide what to do with our newfound wealth. Although some want to keep the silver for hard times, the reformists and purists seek to invest the silver to strengthen their preferred parts of Nimbusia."
 
 NIM_city_culture:0 "The Ecstasy of Foreigners"
 NIM_city_culture_desc:0 "Xenoi, foreigners, have been causing problems in the city. Often drunk on wine, these magi from Wittenland are a nuisance. The reformists have taken up the cause for the foreigners, hoping to combat xenophobia The others factions, meanwhile argue over a suitable punishment for the unicorns."

 NIM_renovate_acropolis:0 "Renovating the Akropolis"
 NIM_renovate_acropolis_desc:0 "The Akropolis of Nimbusi used to be the pride of our people. However, in recent years the temples on it have stood in disrepair. Now, the citizenry demand that something be done. The purists seek to build a new temple to the gods of war, while the traditionalists want a historical renovation. The Reformists, meanwhile, consider the massive building project a waste."

 NIM_slave_affair:0 "A Scandal of Decency"
 NIM_slave_affair_desc:0 "A slave and her master have been caught having an affair. The purist faction is furious, demanding they are punished for diluting pure pegasus blood. The traditionalists are content with a scolding for the two lovers, while the reformists consider the affair personal and want the Boule to acknowledge it has no rights to intervene here."

 NIM_censorship:0 "Censorship of Foreign Works"
 NIM_censorship_desc:0 "After yet another academy student was caught citing the work of Caramel Marks on campus, the traditionalists have had enough of foreign literature. They are a threat to the stability of Nimbusia and should be controlled by a censor. The reformists see this as a direct threat to their freedom and have rallied against the measure."

 NIM_guard:0 "A Personal Bodyguard"
 NIM_guard_desc:0 "With tensions rising, some ponies are concerned for the safety of the Strategos. The purists seek to establish a bodyguard of strong soldiers directly under the command of the General. However, the traditionalists warn that this is a step towards tyranny, as soldiers should only be used with democratic oversight."

 NIM_education:0 "Education for Perioeci"
 NIM_education_desc:0 "With the pace of scientific progress increasing, the reformists are concerned that we are missing out on a vital pool of talent, namely non-citizen Perioeci. In an ambitious proposal, they demand funding for education for the children of non-citizens. The purists have responded with their own plan to renovate the Academy of Nimbusi into a centre for higher learning. For pegasi, that is."

 NIM_big_issue:0 "A Pair of Wings"
 NIM_big_issue_desc:0 "The issue of Star Chaser, the griffon who is adamant that he is a pegasus, has polarised the political climate in the Boule. The reformists see his willingness to try and fit in as an example for non-citizens and support the bird. The traditionalists are fine with letting the harmless and delusional griffon stay, while the purists openly accuse Star Chaser of espionage."

 NIM_appoint_new_commander:0 "A New Chief of Army"
 NIM_appoint_new_commander_desc:0 "In the militarised society of Nimbusia, the army is at the centre of politics. To maintain democratic control of the military, the Boule elects pegasi for certain military offices. It is now time for the Boule to elect a new Chief of Army and all three factions have put forward their preferred candidate, so the vote can still swing in one of three ways."

 NIM_the_law_of_freedom:0 "Pass the Nomos Eleutheriae"
 NIM_the_law_of_freedom_desc:0 "The reformists have managed to secure enough support to finally bring the Perioeci into the fold. When the Law of Freedom, as they call it, passes, the influx of new members to the Boule will ensure that the reformists will have a comfortable majority to pass their other reforms."

 NIM_the_law_of_virtue:0 "Pass the Nomos Aretes"
 NIM_the_law_of_virtue_desc:0 "The traditionalists have managed to sway the Boule to stay the course. Passing the so-called Law of Virtue, a set of regulations on how to behave in public office, is but the first step on their agenda. Those that seek inspiration from our illustrious ancestors can rest easily, knowing that Nimbusia will stay true to our ancient legacy."

 NIM_suspend_ostracism:0 "Suspend the Graphe Paranomon"
 NIM_suspend_ostracism_desc:0 "The purists have increased their control over the military to the point where they are now openly conspiring against democracy! They seek to intimidate the Boule into suspending the Graphe Paranomon, the fundamental law that enables undemocratic laws to be overturned. Is this how democracy dies?"

 #Puritans win
 NIM_state_of_war:0 "The State of War"
 NIM_state_of_war_desc:0 "In the minds of the people, there is a difference between peace and war. It is clear, however, that there will always be another war and we should prepare for it. By declaring Nimbusia to be in a perpetual state of war, we will be able to take all the necessary measures for the defence of our Nation."

 NIM_keep_young:0 "Timocracy"
 NIM_keep_young_desc:0 "It was the bold spirit and search for glory of the young officers of Nimbusia which led us to finally take full control of the state. It is therefore only fair that the most energetic and brave pegasi should lead the country. We will proclaim Andreia as our Autokratessa."

 NIM_get_old:0 "Aristocracy"
 NIM_get_old_desc:0 "It is a true sign of wisdom to give responsibility to those who are more capable. Gylhippos, a veteran officer, is a more calculated and experienced pegasus. We shall proclaim him Autokrator so that his guidance can lead Nimbusia to true strength."

 NIM_fascism_focus_1:0 "A Flying Army"
 NIM_fascism_focus_1_Tech:0 "A Flying Army"
 NIM_fascism_focus_1_desc:0 "Our Army consists purely of pegasi now, which opens the door for some interesting modern doctrines. The Nimbusian soldiers will be able to utilise both horizontal and vertical formations and our pegasi will always outmanoeuvre the enemy!"

 NIM_fascism_focus_2:0 "The Search for Glory"
 NIM_fascism_focus_2_Tech:0 "The Search for Glory"
 NIM_fascism_focus_2_desc:0 "Nimbusian pegasi are the bravest people of all. But we must foster eternal competition between units and soldiers and encourage a search for glory. Our soldiers will be fearless and fight until the last soul if required. We will be remembered as the greatest warriors in history!"

 NIM_fascism_focus_3:0 "Perpetual Agoge"
 NIM_fascism_focus_3_desc:0 "The Agoge rears all young pegasi into upstanding citizens and into brave soldiers. However, with time, it seems that some ponies forget the lessons they learned. By selecting groups of citizens for re-education, we can increase the readiness level of every citizen, even those not normally associated with the army. Of course, this will increase the strain of the army on the economy even further - but that's a sacrifice we all are prepared to accept."

 NIM_fascism_focus_4:0 "The Advisory Boule"
 NIM_fascism_focus_4_desc:0 "Although the opinions and ideas of our most respected citizens are to be taken seriously, the bickering Boule can become a true security hazard. By removing legislative powers from the people and giving them to our ruler, we will ensure stability and continued security."

 NIM_fascism_focus_5:0 "The Krypteia"
 NIM_fascism_focus_5_desc:0 "To keep the slave population in check, we must establish a secret organisation to monitor them. Who knows what the earth ponies and unicorns might be plotting. Naturally, the skills we learn from suppressing dissent at home, can be useful in warfare as well."

 NIM_fascism_focus_15:0 "Unquestioning Discipline"
 NIM_fascism_focus_15_desc:0 "It takes a great sense of duty to listen to orders that others might deem suicidal. Marching through a hail of bullets, or protecting a surrounded strongpoint to cover a retreat. However, for a Nimbusian, these orders are not a punishment, but an honour. For Glory and Death!"

 NIM_fascism_focus_6:0 "The Flying Phalanx"
 NIM_fascism_focus_6_Tech:0 "The Flying Phalanx"
 NIM_fascism_focus_6_desc:0 "In a bygone age, a tight formation of pegasi could hold back many times their number. The Phalanx was the tank of the modern battlefield and it can be so again. By using complicated aerial formations, our elite troops can effectively their resistance to small arms fire."

 NIM_fascism_focus_7:0 "The Metal Pegasus"
 NIM_fascism_focus_7_desc:0 "For millennia, there skies were ruled by our warriors. However, we must concede that technology is making the skies a dangerous place for pegasi. Instead of shying away from the airplane, we should be the ones to embrace it. Only then can we keep the air safe for our army."

 NIM_fascism_focus_8:0 "Autarkia and Oikonomia"
 NIM_fascism_focus_8_desc:0 "If we are to sustain our state, we cannot be wasteful and we cannot rely on others. We must be autarkic and ban trade to the xenoi, while outlawing most luxuries to be more economical. It is time for Nimbusia to rid itself of all the useless distractions of the modern world."

 NIM_fascism_focus_9:0 "They will Fear them"
 NIM_fascism_focus_9_desc:0 "Our population must be kept under control. The sheer size of the serf population means that there is always the risk of a revolt. But by using Krypteia to spread propaganda of the terrible things griffons do to ponies and how we can protect against that, they might just fear the enemy more than they hate us."

 NIM_fascism_focus_11:0 "The Auxiliary Program"
 NIM_fascism_focus_11_desc:0 "Not all slaves are beyond saving. By recruiting some into the army for support tasks, we could increase the number of citizens actually fighting. Who knows, some of these auxiliaries could still proof their worth."

 NIM_fascism_focus_12:0 "Forced Industrialisation"
 NIM_fascism_focus_12_desc:0 "We cannot afford to let our industry fall behind. Whatever the cost, we need new factories now! Luckily, we have an excess of labour. We can lower the supply of labourers and increase demand..."

 NIM_fascism_focus_10:0 "They will Fear us"
 NIM_fascism_focus_10_desc:0 "There is a clear distinction in Nimbusia. We are strong and the slaves are weak. To keep it that way, we must instil a constant fear into the ranks of these people. With careful population control measures, we will keep our nation stable."

 NIM_fascism_focus_13:0 "Military Exercise"
 NIM_fascism_focus_13_desc:0 "It has occurred to us that our army might need training on life targets. Luckily, we have those in ample supply..."

 NIM_fascism_focus_14:0 "Revoke the Rights of Perioeci"
 NIM_fascism_focus_14_desc:0 "Pegasi are clearly the only ponies fit to have any responsibility. The past struggle for power along with the miserable state of our neighbours’ military shows that unicorns and earth-ponies cannot be trusted to do anything independently. No matter, we will guide them."
