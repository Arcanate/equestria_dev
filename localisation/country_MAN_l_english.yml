#### LEADERS ####
LYSIA_DESC:0 "Trained at the prestigious Vesalipolis Military Academy, Lysia was nevertheless relegated to administrative duties working on the Queen's General Staff during the Great War against Equestria. Whilst her classmates achieved glory for the Changeling Lands on the battlefield, she was stuck in Vesalipolis kowtowing to Chrysalis. Her service to the Queen seemed to have paid off, though, as she was bestowed the title of Protectress over the exalted metropolis of Manehattan following its conquest."
LYSIA_GENERAL_DESC:0 "Trained at the prestigious Vesalipolis Military Academy, Lysia served on the Queen's General Staff during the Great War against Equestria. As the Protectress of Manehattan, Lysia finally has the chance to command her own army on the field in the absence of a native officer corps. Her officer's uniform may not be as glamourous as the ceremonial evening gowns befitting her rank of Protectress, but on campaign with her troops is where Lysia feels most at home."

Although politically and economically we are still subservient to our overlords in Vesalipolis, the Protectorate's military can now consider themselves a de facto independent fighting force.\n\nWe had not received much support from our overlords in the past anyways, but our newfound independence means that we are completely on our own, and we will have to take some time adapting to the new status quo."

MAN_beginning_1:0 "84 Crystal Avenue"
MAN_beginning_1_desc:0 "An Art Deco–style skyscraper on No. 84 Crystal Avenue, the Crystaller Building stands as the tallest structure in all of Equestria, its iconic horse's head dominating the Manehattan skyline. The Changeling administration of the Manehattan Protectorate shall commandeer the entirety of its 77 floors as its headquarters that will house the Protectorate's military, intelligence, and administrative operations."
MAN_beginning_3a:0 "Smash the Resistance"
MAN_beginning_3a_desc:0 "The ponies are resentful but still scarred from the war. Our meagre forces must be put to work snuffing out any open resistance we can find."
MAN_beginning_3b:0 "Groom the Collaborationists"
MAN_beginning_3b_desc:0 "Conquering is the easy part. Adminstration is the truly difficult task. With the empire's borders expanding so rapidly, we will need toadies to shore up our thin ranks."
MAN_beginning_1_1:0 "Our Tenuous Grasp"
MAN_beginning_1_1_desc:0 "Manehattan may not be in open revolt, but it is not a cowed city. The ponies here are uncooperative at best and actively swindle and sabatoge us at worst. Lysia's hold on power is not terribly strong."
MAN_second_wing_1:0 "Building Bridges?"
MAN_second_wing_1_desc:0 "To build bridges between the Protectors and the 'Protected', Lysia has mandated the reconstruction of Manehattan's pride and joy - the Brooklyn Bridge, damaged during the fall of the city. She hopes this will make the locals a bit more compliant."
MAN_second_wing_2a:0 "The Urban Renewal Authority"
MAN_second_wing_2a_desc:0 "Protector Lysia has a dream of a Manehattan that is neither Equestrian nor Changeling, but both. Or at least one that's fun and peaceful. To that end, its time to start cleaning up all these war torn ghettos, evicting their squatter populations to allow for eventual Changeling settlement. We're cleaning up the city!"
MAN_second_wing_2b:0 "Retool the Maneway"
MAN_second_wing_2b_desc:0 "The iconic Maneway network is the vital infrastructure that knits Manehattan together, and under the pretense of repairing its battle-damaged lines, we will retool it to be an efficient means of dispatching our security forces all across the city - artillery, panzers, and all. Reports of pony resistance cells operating from within the Maneway's sprawling subterranean tunnels are unsubstantiated."
MAN_second_wing_3a:0 "A Changeling Tax Haven"
MAN_second_wing_3a_desc:0 "Hoping to ingratiate herself not only with the rich Changeling moguls in Vesalipolis, but with Manehattan's native upper class as well, Protector Lysia has made her city something of a tax haven. She hopes when the time comes, she can trust on them to cut her good deals."
MAN_second_wing_3b:0 "The Gears of Progress"
MAN_second_wing_3b_desc:0 "The gears of progress churn churn churn! Or whatever gears do. Lysia doesn't actually know! But she does know societal progress when she sees it and it looks like Manehattan."
MAN_second_wing_4:0 "Radio & Television Manehattan"
MAN_second_wing_4_desc:0 ""Goooooooooooooooooooood Evening Manehattan! I'm your host Crystal Spice, and tonight we have a very special broadcast for you all...""
MAN_second_wing_4_1:0 "Revitalise the Seaports"
MAN_second_wing_4_1_desc:0 "The city cannot depend solely on supply and business from overland. It has always looked outwards to the wine dark oceans and it must do so again. But first, the ports must be repaired and repurposed for civilian use again."
MAN_second_wing_5:0 "The Manehattan Culturefest"
MAN_second_wing_5_desc:0 "At the Manehattan Concert Hall, newly renovated to suit Changeling architectural tastes, the Manehattan Sinfonietta shall perform alongside guest musicians from the Soryth Philharmonic Orchestra in a display of cross-species unity and cooperation, with the legendary Trimmel himself being on the official guest list. Reports of supposed pony mischief aimed at disrupting the concert are unsubstantiated."
MAN_second_wing_6a:0 "Shipping Routes to the Eastern Continent"
MAN_second_wing_6a_desc:0 "During peacetime a common pactice of Equestrian industrialists was trade with the Griffon continent, in which they could make a significant amount of money in the markets to the east. We should co-opt this policy for ourselves, though we may need to put some armor on our trade ships to prevent them being attacked..."
MAN_second_wing_6b:0 "The Eastern Bulwark"
MAN_second_wing_6b_desc:0 "As they grow stronger, the treacherous powers of Griffonia eye our Empire with growing suspicion. The fortification of our eastern seaboard is in order to protect the Hegemony against a seaborne invasion from the east. With time, resources, and ingenuity, we shall make Manehattan into the Changeling bulwark against Griffonia. "
MAN_army_1:0 "The Eastern Garrison"
MAN_army_1_desc:0 "The garrison provided to Manettan was relatively small for how many ponies it was supposed to control, but Lysia's officers are making due."
MAN_army_2a:0 "New Training Regimen"
MAN_army_2a_desc:0 "The first order of business is fixing the training regimen for our soldiers. Our traditional doctrines pre-suppose open ground and lots of room for manuever. We no longer have these luxuries and must adapt."
MAN_army_2b:0 "Hunters within the Concrete Jungle"
MAN_army_2b_desc:0 "The Protectorate's soldier must be more than a rifleling. They must become like the ancient Changelings and hunt like a true predator. In the urban environment of Manehattan, we do not fight rebels. We hunt them."
MAN_army_3a:0 "Chemical Warfare, Urbanised"
MAN_army_3a_desc:0 "The applied research on chemical warfare performed by the Royal Changeling Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defence was a huge boon to the Changeling war effort against Equestria. With all the resources and laboratories of Manehattan at our disposal, we should invite some of their experts to help develop new methods of chemical warfare suited to urban environments."
MAN_army_3b:0 "Weapons from the Motherland"
MAN_army_3b_desc:0 "It's all coming up Manehattan! The Protectorate is due to receive a large shipment of munitions by Queen Chrysalis' grace."
MAN_army_4:0 "Weaponised Lachrymation"
MAN_army_4_desc:0 "Changelings have always been about speed and numbers on the battlefield, but in Manehattan we do things differently. The Royal Army researched into chemical warfare, but we will push even further. The development of a special sort of anti-riot gas shall aid our commanders and soldiers greately in their task to pacify and govern over the restless ponies of Manehattan."
MAN_army_4_1:0 "The New Blood"
MAN_army_4_1_desc:0 "Since we are building up the Manehattan Protectorate's military from scratch, we will have to start recruiting officers for our High Command as well. Lysia has drawn up a list of friends and colleagues from her time serving on the Queen's General Staff, and we will start headhunting them to serve as generals in our autonomous high command - the Ost-Kommando."
MAN_army_5:0 "Gas-Mask Masquerade"
MAN_army_5_desc:0 "In order to show off the strength of the Manehattan garrison, we should hold a highly publicised event in the capital where we can show off our new equipment we recieved from the queen. What we show off... well that's yet to be determined. Dignitaries from the Changeling Lands, Trimmel himself amongst them, will be present. Lysia will be happy to see her friends."
MAN_army_6b:0 "A Native Panzerkorps"
MAN_army_6b_desc:0 "It took a little convincing, but after consulting the numbers even the staunchest of our officers agree. We need more soldiers to cover the Protectorate's large territory, and to do that not only we are going to need local levies, but also a hard core of armoured units to crush any organised resistance. To this end General Dairyn has come to Manehattan, bringing with him his panzers to bolster our forces."
MAN_army_6a:0 "Urban Redoubts"
MAN_army_6a_desc:0 "As we clean up the city, our engineering drones have also rebuilt some now useless structures into small fortresses within which a platoon or so of Changelings can be comfortably housed. For safety, of course. We envision that such fortifications be present in every population centre of note, so as to better enshrine the presence of our garrisons all over the Protectorate."
MAN_beginning_2_1:0 "Forays into Menticide"
MAN_beginning_2_1_desc:0 "It seems that entirely by accident, a rumor has begun to spread amongst the high-value prisoners in our jails. This rumor details how we have tactics to get into ponies' heads and control them to give up information and do our bidding. While this is not entirely true, this reputation can help us..."
MAN_beginning_4a:0 "Auxiliary Battalions"
MAN_beginning_4a_desc:0 "Any good army needs special bodies of armed 'lings - and as it seems now, pony auxiliaries - suited for tasks the average platoon simply cannot do well. Recon, construction, siegeworks, you name it."
MAN_beginning_4b:0 "Business as Usual"
MAN_beginning_4b_desc:0 "What's good for the Protectorate is what's good for you! Or that's what they say. Keep your head down, pay your dues, bring in the cash. The Protectorate smiles on the industrious."
MAN_beginning_4c:0 "Institutionalise the Constabulary"
MAN_beginning_4c_desc:0 "Law and Order is starting to become a problem. We've told Protector Lysia, but honestly she seemed kind of... hungover? She's handpicked one of her pony cronies to be in charge of the collaborationist Constabulary, who will immediately set about recruiting and arming Changeling-loyal pony paramilitaries."
MAN_beginning_4d:0 "The Winged Order for National Salvation"
MAN_beginning_4d_desc:0 "It needs not be remarked that the peculiar bewinged pegasi are, amongst the Three Tribes, a people most naturally predisposed towards authoritarianism. The former Wonderbolts officer and establishment figure Wind Rider shall join us, commanding the pegasi collaborationists of the Winged Order of National Salvation."
UNUSED:0 "Centralise the Collaboration"
UNUSED_desc:0 "We've got a whole network of informants and collaborators, but right now a lot of them are in six dozen disorganized file boxes of notes. Lysia pawns organzing the ponies off to her least favorite aide."
MAN_beginning_2a:0 "The Registry Bureau"
MAN_beginning_2a_desc:0 "As much as she tries to spin it as a good thing, Protector Lysia knows that there's just no way to make getting every pony in town registered and listed sounds fun, or non-threatening."
MAN_beginning_2b:0 "Muzzle the Academia"
MAN_beginning_2b_desc:0 "The Manehattan Intelligensia are obnoxious, as they were before our arrival. But now they're starting to turn their gaze on us, holding talks and potentially even aiding the ELF. Which doesn't exist, for the record. Either way, the city's academic establishment need to be taught some discipline."
MAN_beginning_2c:0 "Negotiate the Love Tax"
MAN_beginning_2c_desc:0 "It's simple, really. Changelings need love to survive. Ponies make love just, like, automatically. Ponies also don't want the Protectorate to bother them much. Think of your day-per-month as a kind of donation. But maintaining the strict quotas for Love imposed on us from Vesalipolis takes up a lot of our manpower and resources, so Lysia will get Queen Chrysalis to revamp the taxation system."
MAN_beginning_2d:0 "The Economic Frontier"
MAN_beginning_2d_desc:0 "Changeling economics is based on Changeling culture and lifestyle, but these things have gone straight out the window in the territories. All the territories are experimenting, and Manehattan is no exception."
MAN_beginning_2e:0 "Pick their Brains"
MAN_beginning_2e_desc:0 "Hypothetically, if we *could* read your brain, which we can't, we of course wouldn't find anything incriminating. Right? Of course not. We're all friends here. Anyways, we've gotten our hands on some new pyschoanalysis tech, and we'll trial them on some pony scientists under our protection! In the name of science, of course. They'll understand."
MAN_beginning_2f:0 "Internal Passport Plan"
MAN_beginning_2f_desc:0 "Passports! They get you places! What is the next borough over but a small country with its own vibrant culture and also tightly controlled access points and borders? It's very orderly, at least."
MAN_beginning_2g:0 "Hearts and Minds"
MAN_beginning_2g_desc:0 "Lysia thinks of herself as a Changeling of the people. Ponies. Whatever. Perhaps making the ponies fear us less will result in a more malleable populace to govern. We'll test this concept out with "Hug a Changeling" day."
MAN_beginning_2h:0 "Rewriting History"
MAN_beginning_2h_desc:0 "In the beginning, wicked alicorns came down from on high to do battle for the cities of the plain, and smote many a pony. They laid a terrible curse on all ponykind, one not lifted until recently by a beautiful Queen. The revised official historical narratives might take some time getting familiar with, but we're sure the ponies will manage. And what better way to test that knowledge than through a game show?"
MAN_beginning_2i:0 "Indoctrination Program"
MAN_beginning_2i_desc:0 "How much of the indoctrination's success is real, and how much of it is a cyncial fakery to get through the day? And does it even matter? Who knows! Praise Chrysalis."
MAN_beginning_2j:0 "Instate Military Law"
MAN_beginning_2j_desc:0 "While martial law in some form has been the norm in Manehattan for as long as we've been here, it is only now that we have codified it into a more reasonable and sustainable form. Just as well, because we're going to have to set a whole lot of new legal precedents for a prickly court case."
MAN_beginning_2k:0 "Conscript the Scientists"
MAN_beginning_2k_desc:0 "A scientist is a soldier in the army of progress! Terrible slogan, but also exactly what our new programs believe. The old eggheads are the new R&D, and we've provided swanky living and clean labs for a lifetime."
MAN_beginning_4e:0 "Amp Up Military Production"
MAN_beginning_4e_desc:0 "To build up a larger force drawn from Changeling settlers and pony collaborators means more guns. We need to ramp up production in order to supply ourselves, but also to be an arsenal for all of the hives if need be. Protectress Lysia believes that an inspection of collaborator-run military factories is in order to make sure our quotas are being fulfilled."
UNUSED:0 "Reorganise the Manehattan Police"
UNUSED_desc:0 "As fun as direct rule by hoofboot is, it isn't very stable. To that end, the Manehattan PD lives again, this time quite firmly in the service of the Protectorate government."
MAN_beginning_4f:0 "The Inkognito-Division"
MAN_beginning_4f_desc:0 "The best and/or worst thing about Changelings is their ability to be anything, anyone, and anywhere. They are natural infiltrators, and even more natural sabatouers and spies. This preternatural ability served us well in the war, and shall serve us well in our victory. Commander Soryn, who in the war had led one of our best infiltrator divisions, has come to share with us her expertise - and she's bringing her boys along too."
MAN_beginning_5a:0 "Break their Codes"
MAN_beginning_5a_desc:0 "Even as we firmly deny the existence of the E.L.F., we have struggled to break their airtight security for far too long. We must make progress."
MAN_beginning_5b:0 "The Spyeye Program"
MAN_beginning_5b_desc:0 "In true Changeling fashion, we have created the next evolution in state surveillance. The concept of an all-seeing, omniscient security apparatus is truly the best idea we could have ever asked for, and we did in fact explicitly ask for it. Smile for the camera."
MAN_beginning_5c:0 "The Resistance is Us"
MAN_beginning_5c_desc:0 "It is time to activate our deepest agent in the resistance. He is in so deep, in fact, that we have lost contact with him, but we retain the secret protocols that will bring him out of his guise. With rumors of a major resistance gathering to try and coordinate greater efforts against us, we can only hope he knows what to do."
MAN_beginning_5d:0 "For Your Own Good"
MAN_beginning_5d_desc:0 "As any state should, ours exists for the good of our citizens, mainly the changeling ones but eh.

This eruption of seditious activity on such a large scale is alleged to be the first coordinated effort by the so-called "Harmonic Resistance" active on the eastern Equestrian seaboard. Hitherto unsubstantiated reports coming from sources in the Changeling administration allege that the "Harmonic Resistance" is in fact led by none other than the ponies known as "Starlight Glimmer" and "Trixie Lulamoon" - the former the progenitor of the failed ideology dubbed "Equalism", and the latter a washed-out street magician.

Most importantly, the fact that we were still able, unprepared as we had been, to put down the unrest meant that the legitimacy of our governance over the Protectorate was still uncontested thus far.\n\nWe may have weathered the storm today, but the reports of our infiltrator agents in the field point towards a rising trend in anti-Changeling, pro-Harmonic, and secessionist thought amongst the general population of the Protectorate. Similar waves of unrest akin to what happened in the [MAN_uprising_in_state_event_target.GetName] region are certainties that we are sure to experience in the coming months.\n\nWe must stand against the tide and protect the Motherland from the pony rabble that would seek to destroy the hard-earned fruits of our conquest."

On this issue two competing factions vie for supremacy; our more ardent militarists call for the demolition of what remains of the old bridge in favour of a wholly new edifice, built in the Changeling architectural tradition as an ode to our victory.

Normally such an important operation would be touted and hinted at by our propagandists in order to drive up fear and anxiety, as form of pyschological warfare. This operation, however, would be all dark.\n\nThe Manehattan Polytechnic institute was a focal point for engineering, the sciences, and higher education in general in the city, but its main campus building, open to the public, served little academic use, and the historic structure was instead rumoured to be a hotbed of Resistance activity.\n\nThis would be ended fast. Under the cover of darkness, the jaegers approached on all sides and placed barrels of kerrosine oil all along the outside of the building. Then, Lysia herself, an engineer by training, short-circuited the electrical system and set it all alight. The fire department arrived but it was too late. The symbol of learning under Celestial rule was gone. Reduced to atoms.\n\nIn all honesty, Lysia didn't really have that much concrete evidence that the campus building was indeed a hotbed of resistance activity.

Using the new method of triangulation, we have located a single source from which many of the resistance transmissions around Manehattan stem, and are now prepared to move in.\n\nThe location is a seemingly unthreatening cabin in the forests outside of the city. Jaegers have moved in at night and are prepared to bring it down. Tear gas shells are fired, flashbangs are set off and the compound falls like a wet paper bag.\n\nAlmost literally.\n\nWhen our units reached the inside they found only 3 unarmed ponies and a high-powered radio.\n\nAfter some investigation, it turned out that the messages we had been trying to break were just complete and utter gargle, and this station's only goal was to just keep putting out nonsense.

After her guards subdued the factory, the irony of the situation revealed itself. The factory WAS undeed extremely productivem and many of the workers there were sympathetic to the new regime, as they had been former collaborationists who the Resistance had captured and coerced into working in this factory.\n\nNow comes a choice for Lysia.

There were too many of them here to strike in their current state, and bringing in more forces would alert enough Resistance operatives that they would retreat once more underground. And they couldn't let that happen. They could now only hope for whatever their commanding officer had planned to succeed.\n\nCommander Amaz, Special Operative of the Protectorate Security Division. It was him that the soldiers were trusting with the plan to conquer the building, and so he had to put everything he could into not letting them know that in fact, he really had no idea what to do either. He had simply told them to keep observing and wait. He figured that he would come up with something resembling a plan, somehow, eventually.\n\nAs the dissident ponies gathered within the building, one who seemed to be their leader stepped onto the make-shift podium against the wall of the broken building and began to speak...\n\n"Hello fellow members of the Resistance!"\n\n"Tonight we have gathered to plot our greatest action yet against the buggers who wish to hold us down."\n\nThere is murmured acceptance from the crowd.\n\n"Now this plan is only known to a few of you here, of course, and has been in the works for a long time. It shall be the greatest effort of the Resistance ever to bring down the only thing holding back Manehattan from becoming what it is meant to be!"\n\n"We... faithful members of the re-resistance are prepared to do whatever we need to being down the accursed enemy..." The crowd begins to be confused, not recognising the rhetoric. "Our uhh... our great campaign shall SQUASH the bugs under our HOOVES, yes, yes!" The pony began cackling and almost dropped from the podium itself.\n\nWhen the figure regained his composure he stood up, straightened his jacket, and spoke once more - "Eh, screw it, the jig's up!", and with that he cackled again as a ghastly green fire enveloped him. In place of the pony Resistance member was instead a grizzled-looking Changeling - a fate shared by many of the Resistance members of the audience. Caught completely off guard, the gathered Resistance broke under the chaotic onslaught of the Changeling operatives in their midst. The exits from the building had all been secured by undercover Changeling infiltrators who subdued anypony trying to flee, and in ferocious room-to-room fighting, squads of jaegers in gas masks wiped out the last Resistance holdouts in the basement and upper floors through the liberal use of tear gas. After the Changelings outside the building had closed in and mopped up any stragglers, the largest roundup of Resistance members ever had been successfully conducted.\n\nAnd so emerged the agent known as c24.

Well-connected with the scrawny but highly advanced military-industrial complex under the Diarchy, the scientists could be persuaded to impart to us their knowledge of Equestrian weapon systems development.

MAN_ELF.72.d:0 "Beyond the outskirts of Ponyville lies the Everfree Forest. Densely packed with ancient, gnarled trees hundreds of years old, in many places the undergrowth is nigh-impenetrable, leaving travellers only with the few paths through the forest that somehow manage to stay clear of foliage. The deeper one plunges into its depths, the more otherworldly the forest seems as civilisation recedes; the sun fails to pierce the opaque canopies, the treeroots on the forest floor grow so contorted it is hard not to trip, and the flora becomes so exotic and wild to be undomesticable even through earth pony magic. The shadows become thick and foreboding, and the pervading gloom makes it hard to see past a few metres. One can easily imagine getting lost in the murk, doomed to wander the forest until the end of time.\n\nNo wonder, then, that Zecora's Everfree Resistance had managed to survive as long as it did within. Not so long ago, their bloody and short-lived insurrection had surged to encompass the surrounding towns, threatening Canterlot before being forced back into the forest from whence they came. But the Everfree Resistance seemed to have an unnatural affinity with the woods of their namesake, and the Changeling divisions bled ten times as heavily clearing the forest as they did its surrounds.\n\nBut with the brute force of sheer firepower, they had managed. They burnt the trees until there were none left for the ponies to hide behind. Artillery barrages cut swathes through the undergrowth. And they had deployed so many tons of defoliant that even the Everfree began to sag under the poisonous onslaught. As the forest burned, Zecora's insurrection withered away until there was nothing left.\n\nAt least, this was the official narrative. But patrols through the forest still went missing from time to time, and already the Everfree was recovering rapidly from the damage wrought by the Changeling invasion. To be sent to this particular frontier was tantamount to a penal assignment, and everypony knew it.\n\nThis did not explain why Ocellus, a fully-fledged corps commander qualified to lead entire divisions into battle, was now trekking through the mud, leading a column of Changelings through the Everfree. It was supposed to raise morale, Lysia had said. Her aunt's apologetic demeanor suggested otherwise, implying, with a thinly-veiled rage, that higher powers in Vesalipolis had a hand in her newest assignment.\n\nWas she merely a pawn in Lysia's power plays, then? Perhaps her assignment to such a dangerous posting was designed to punish her aunt for some esoteric transgression against the elites in Vesalipolis.\n\nFor now, it didn't matter. The front of the column has paused at some unseen obstacle. Ocellus glimpses shadowy figures flitting from tree to tree, and the murky depths of the forest begin to shift with the movements of creatures unknown. Behind her, there is an unfolding of blades as her troops affix bayonets. Ocellus pauses, and tries to gauge the nature of their soon-to-be assailants."

There are at least two dozen of them, and the largest of the pack would easily outweigh a Changeling panzer. Ocellus wonders how the Everfree Resistance managed to keep them at bay.\n\nBut fierce as they are, the timberwolves are no match for the heavy machine-guns the column deploy, and in an instant those at the forefront are torn apart by unrelenting volleys of gunfire, shredded into clouds of wood splinters and bad vibes. Ocellus directs her column's fire onto the charging timberwolves with unwavering precision, until the creatures are all dead or routed."

But by then half their number are already dead or wounded, and the remnants of the column are beset on all sides by the Everfree Resistance, of which Ocellus can only make out faint blurs as the partisans flit from tree to tree.\n\nShe picks out a partisan gunner on a treetop, half-hidden by a curtain of vines, and shoots. Past her smoking pistol she makes out the corpse of her unlucky target, falling to the ground. But there are too many of them, and the forest is the ponies' domain. They make a brave last stand at the base of a great oak tree, and their final remnants are at last cut down where they stand by unseen pony snipers.\n\nOcellus, somehow, evades the pony partisans who are butchering her soldiers, and flees into the depths of the Everfree."

It was supposed to be just a publicity bit, showing the troops that their leaders understood the view from below. But the partisans of the Everfree Resistance had hit hard them in the woods, and after bullets had sliced through her wings she had tumbled down into this ravine. And then the timberwolves came.\n\nThis one had been unlucky. When she’d killed one of its companions with a few well placed shots, the rest had fallen back, and this lone creature had lost its footing. Now it was hungry, and its presence was keeping her trapped here more surely than her broken wings.\n\nShe tried scaring it, and then ignoring it, and lastly, out of a kind of lonely grace, she offered the creature some of her rations.\n\nWhen the reinforcements finally found her two days later, that wolf was already hers."

Give them a cause or a warm, happy memory and they'll cling to it until the bitter end.\n\nIn this case, deliverance from the Changeling jackboot comes in the form of their unassailable Princess-Mother, her chaste, maternal demeanor and the profundity of her mystical powers combined in a paragon of Equestrian divinity — the pinnacle of everything a pony wants to become. That the sun still rises and sets without her guidance is immaterial to the ponies' worship of the Solar Goddess, which, if anything, has intensified under the new Changeling regime. And there's that eccentric, semi-repressed sexualisation of Celestia as well that no doubt further endears her to the population — what was it that psychologists said about children wanting to mate with their mothers?\n\nSo long as they remember her, Celestia's very memory and existence will certainly continue to motivate them to insubordination and in time, open revolt. Lysia's new initiatives to 'educate' the populace about their old leaders' many faults may not always be factual, and the process of indoctrination will require much time and effort, but she has no doubt that it will be beneficial to the legitimacy of the new regime with time.\n\nManehattan's schools now teach young foals and changelings about Celestia the tyrant, greedy, stubborn, and myopic, a lazy delegator who pursued luxury whilst other ponies did all the work.

Now that Lysia has managed to cement the Changeling presence in the city of Manehattan and its satellites, however, the elimination of the Fillydelphia and Albion resistance organisations has become the next objective of paramount importance for the Garrison.\n\nFor the past few weeks, Changeling agents undercover in pony guises have infiltrated the respective organisations of the two restive cities, keeping tabs on the actions and whereabouts of the most prominent Resistance leaders. Having been allowed to flourish, these organisations proved more resistant to infiltration, with several infiltrators being uncovered and subsequently lost, but shielded by the intensification of policing and reprisal actions by local garrisons, the operatives largely succeeded in revealing the identities of the surviving leadership of the Resistance.\n\nLysia's coup de grâce to the Albion and Fillydelphia Resistances came in the form of Operation Häuten. The nights that preceded the operation were exceedingly foggy, through the manipulations of collaborationist pegasi and Changeling magitech. The garrisons, who had exhibited such brutality in their policing of the past weeks, were strangely quiescent and docile, even as curfew-breaking Resistance members, emboldened by the obfuscating fog, engaged in petty skirmishes with Changeling checkpoints and patrols. For a while, it seemed that the suffocating mist that had descended on Fillydelphia and Albion both had revitalised the Resistance, the opaque veil of whiteness offering a cosy anonymity to dissidents and criminals alike.\n\nIn the weeks to follow, though, the ponies of the Resistance would be wishing that the dense, ephemeral fog they had grown to like would instead be replaced by the billowing clouds of Changeling tear gas deployed in Manehattan. Changeling jaegers, shrouded in riot gear and gas masks, preyed on anypony who dared stay out on the streets past the curfew. Often, the unlucky target would not see their pursuers' approach until they emerged wraith-like from the milky fog, swinging their trucheons. Plucky members of the Resistance checking in on safe houses and hideouts reported them missing their inhabitants, food half-eaten on the tables and the nebulous fog creeping in from opened windows. Ponies venturing outdoors at night courted the risk of being taken by the many Changeling snatch-squads lurking within the fog. Their families dreaded something else entirely - that something wearing the face of their loved ones would return home in their stead.\n\nNo members of the Central Resistance Committee in Albion have been seen for the past week, dead nor alive. In Fillydelphia, rumours abound of an absentee leadership clandestinely smuggled across the sea to Griffonia, leaving behind the shattered and demoralised remnants of a resistance. Paranoid and frightened, the squabbling residues of the Resistance begin to tear themselves apart in internecine witch hunts.\n\nIn Manehattan, Lysia surveys the fruits of her conquest, and laughs."

MAN_ELF.95.t:0 "An Impromptu Martyr"
MAN_ELF.95.d:0 "Prior to the Great War, the anti-establishment philosopher known as "Hoofdrich Chryzsche" was a figure notorious for his radical anti-monarchist views and contrarian attitude, but not much else. Equestria's defeat and the subsequent Changeling occupation seemed to revitalise his fiery rhetoric, however, as dissident ponies living under the new Changeling regime found themselves in need of an iconic figurehead to rally around, and the eccentric, populist Hoofdrich was the ideal character to play the role.\n\nTo any critically-minded observer, the fact that he had been allowed to remain a vocal but outspoken opposition figure under the Protectress Lysia's rule, even whilst the real subversives of the Harmonic Resistance were being hunted relentlessly, seemed like an obvious indictment of his relative harmlessness in the grand scheme of things - a conveniently defanged talking head to satisfy the appetites of milquetoast dissidents.\n\nIn the end, though, whether Hoofdrich's contrarian philosophy was of any real substance became immaterial to his image. Found dead this morning at his penthouse apartment on Manehattan's Bridleway, his corpse was still warm when the mainstream dissident newspapers, accusing the Changeling regime of having assassinated the philosopher, called for a general strike and street demonstrations in his memory.\n\nThough the economic impact made by those in the workforce who had struck was decidedly minimal, by dusk there was a large congregation of ponies in downtown Bronclyn's Central Park holding vigil around a makeshift shrine for Hoofdrich, now having become a martyr of the Resistance. Nightfall saw groups of armed ponies descend on the park, forcing out the Constabulary present and erecting hasty barricades around Hoofdrich's shrine. The flag of the Manehattan Protectorate flying above the park's central plaza was torn down, and the Equestrian royal banner raised in its place.\n\nAt daybreak, the massed ranks of Changeling troops and their Constabulary auxiliaries stationed around the park's perimeter would prepare their assault on the barricades. Panzers and artillery pieces would be brought up via the Maneway, and collaborationist skirmishers would erode the boundaries of the Resistance-occupied parkland. The encircled ponies readied their rifles and prepared to make a grim last stand around Hoofdrich's Shrine.\n\nAt least, this was how things were supposed to go. Instead, the few companies of Changeling soldiers around the park found themselves surrounded by crowds of restive ponies, drawn there by the news of an impending massacre of Resistance. The armoured reinforcements never arrived because the Maneway rails had been sabotaged overnight, and the collaborationists, upon seeing the swelling and increasingly angry masses of Manehattanites who had shown up in opposition, simply melted away.\n\nThe situation is quickly getting out of hoof as Fillydelphia and Albion convulse in sympathy riots, and if Manehattan is not pacified soon the rest of the Harmonic Resistance may well decide to further escalate the situation. Masked rioters are skirmishing with Constabulary and Changeling soldiers all over the city, and the population grows more restless by the minute. Lysia is awoken early and convenes the Ost-Kommando in an emergency meeting."
