#### LEADERS ####
LYSIA_DESC:0 "Trained at the prestigious Vesalipolis Military Academy, Lysia was nevertheless relegated to administrative duties working on the Queen's General Staff during the Great War against Equestria. Whilst her classmates achieved glory for the Changeling Lands on the battlefield, she was stuck in Vesalipolis kowtowing to Chrysalis. Her service to the Queen seemed to have paid off, though, as she was bestowed the title of Protectress over the exalted metropolis of Manehattan following its conquest."
LYSIA_GENERAL_DESC:0 "Trained at the prestigious Vesalipolis Military Academy, Lysia served on the Queen's General Staff during the Great War against Equestria. As the Protectress of Manehattan, Lysia finally has the chance to command her own army on the field in the absence of a native officer corps. Her officer's uniform may not be as glamourous as the ceremonial evening gowns befitting her rank of Protectress, but on campaign with her troops is where Lysia feels most at home."

MAN_severed_high_command_desc:0 "Ruling over the Manehattan territories, the military high command of Protectress Lysia - the self-styled Ostkommando - has effectively cut off the control of Chrysalis' central military command over the Manehattan Protectorate's Changeling garrison. Although politically and economically we are still subservient to our overlords in Vesalipolis, the Protectorate's military can now consider themselves a de facto independent fighting force.\n\nWe had not received much support from our overlords in the past anyways, but our newfound independence means that we are completely on our own, and we will have to take some time adapting to the new status quo."

Right now we're called the E.L.F., but all our enemies, within and without, might cause us to disappear. It won't matter. Ponies like us always slip through the net."

#### FOCI ####
MAN_beginning_1:0 "84 Crystal Avenue"
MAN_beginning_1_desc:0 "An Art Deco–style skyscraper on No. 84 Crystal Avenue, the Crystaller Building stands as the tallest structure in all of Equestria, its iconic horse's head dominating the Manehattan skyline. The Changeling administration of the Manehattan Protectorate shall commandeer the entirety of its 77 floors as its headquarters that will house the Protectorate's military, intelligence, and administrative operations."
MAN_beginning_3a:0 "Smash the Resistance"
MAN_beginning_3a_desc:0 "The ponies are resentful but still scarred from the war. Our meagre forces must be put to work snuffing out any open resistance we can find."
MAN_beginning_3b:0 "Groom the Collaborationists"
MAN_beginning_3b_desc:0 "Conquering is the easy part. Adminstration is the truly difficult task. With the empire's borders expanding so rapidly, we will need toadies to shore up our thin ranks."
MAN_beginning_1_1:0 "Our Tenuous Grasp"
MAN_beginning_1_1_desc:0 "Manehattan may not be in open revolt, but it is not a cowed city. The ponies here are uncooperative at best and actively swindle and sabatoge us at worst. Lysia's hold on power is not terribly strong."
MAN_second_wing_1:0 "Building Bridges?"
MAN_second_wing_1_desc:0 "To build bridges between the Protectors and the 'Protected', Lysia has mandated the reconstruction of Manehattan's pride and joy - the Brooklyn Bridge, damaged during the fall of the city. She hopes this will make the locals a bit more compliant."
MAN_second_wing_2a:0 "The Urban Renewal Authority"
MAN_second_wing_2a_desc:0 "Protector Lysia has a dream of a Manehattan that is neither Equestrian nor Changeling, but both. Or at least one that's fun and peaceful. To that end, its time to start cleaning up all these war torn ghettos, evicting their squatter populations to allow for eventual Changeling settlement. We're cleaning up the city!"
MAN_second_wing_2b:0 "Retool the Maneway"
MAN_second_wing_2b_desc:0 "The iconic Maneway network is the vital infrastructure that knits Manehattan together, and under the pretense of repairing its battle-damaged lines, we will retool it to be an efficient means of dispatching our security forces all across the city - artillery, panzers, and all. Reports of pony resistance cells operating from within the Maneway's sprawling subterranean tunnels are unsubstantiated."
MAN_second_wing_3a:0 "A Changeling Tax Haven"
MAN_second_wing_3a_desc:0 "Hoping to ingratiate herself not only with the rich Changeling moguls in Vesalipolis, but with Manehattan's native upper class as well, Protector Lysia has made her city something of a tax haven. She hopes when the time comes, she can trust on them to cut her good deals."
MAN_second_wing_3b:0 "The Gears of Progress"
MAN_second_wing_3b_desc:0 "The gears of progress churn churn churn! Or whatever gears do. Lysia doesn't actually know! But she does know societal progress when she sees it and it looks like Manehattan."
MAN_second_wing_4:0 "Radio & Television Manehattan"
MAN_second_wing_4_desc:0 ""Goooooooooooooooooooood Evening Manehattan! I'm your host Crystal Spice, and tonight we have a very special broadcast for you all...""
MAN_second_wing_4_1:0 "Revitalise the Seaports"
MAN_second_wing_4_1_desc:0 "The city cannot depend solely on supply and business from overland. It has always looked outwards to the wine dark oceans and it must do so again. But first, the ports must be repaired and repurposed for civilian use again."
MAN_second_wing_5:0 "The Manehattan Culturefest"
MAN_second_wing_5_desc:0 "At the Manehattan Concert Hall, newly renovated to suit Changeling architectural tastes, the Manehattan Sinfonietta shall perform alongside guest musicians from the Soryth Philharmonic Orchestra in a display of cross-species unity and cooperation, with the legendary Trimmel himself being on the official guest list. Reports of supposed pony mischief aimed at disrupting the concert are unsubstantiated."
MAN_second_wing_6a:0 "Shipping Routes to the Eastern Continent"
MAN_second_wing_6a_desc:0 "During peacetime a common pactice of Equestrian industrialists was trade with the Griffon continent, in which they could make a significant amount of money in the markets to the east. We should co-opt this policy for ourselves, though we may need to put some armor on our trade ships to prevent them being attacked..."
MAN_second_wing_6b:0 "The Eastern Bulwark"
MAN_second_wing_6b_desc:0 "As they grow stronger, the treacherous powers of Griffonia eye our Empire with growing suspicion. The fortification of our eastern seaboard is in order to protect the Hegemony against a seaborne invasion from the east. With time, resources, and ingenuity, we shall make Manehattan into the Changeling bulwark against Griffonia. "
MAN_army_1:0 "The Eastern Garrison"
MAN_army_1_desc:0 "The garrison provided to Manettan was relatively small for how many ponies it was supposed to control, but Lysia's officers are making due."
MAN_army_2a:0 "New Training Regimen"
MAN_army_2a_desc:0 "The first order of business is fixing the training regimen for our soldiers. Our traditional doctrines pre-suppose open ground and lots of room for manuever. We no longer have these luxuries and must adapt."
MAN_army_2b:0 "Hunters of the Concrete Jungle"
MAN_army_2b_desc:0 "The Protectorate's soldier must be more than a rifleling. They must become like the ancient Changelings and hunt like a true predator. In the urban environment of Manehattan, we do not fight rebels. We hunt them."
MAN_army_3a:0 "Chemical Warfare, Urbanised"
MAN_army_3a_desc:0 "The applied research on chemical warfare performed by the Royal Changeling Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defence was a huge boon to the Changeling war effort against Equestria. With all the resources and laboratories of Manehattan at our disposal, we should invite some of their experts to help develop new methods of chemical warfare suited to urban environments."
MAN_army_3b:0 "Weapons from the Motherland"
MAN_army_3b_desc:0 "It's all coming up Manehattan! The Protectorate is due to receive a large shipment of munitions by Queen Chrysalis' grace."
MAN_army_4:0 "Weaponised Lachrymation"
MAN_army_4_desc:0 "Changelings have always been about speed and numbers on the battlefield, but in Manehattan we do things differently. The Royal Army researched into chemical warfare, but we will push even further. The development of a special sort of anti-riot gas shall aid our commanders and soldiers greately in their task to pacify and govern over the restless ponies of Manehattan."
MAN_army_4_1:0 "Enlist Changeling Generals"
MAN_army_4_1_desc:0 "Since we are building up the Manehattan Protectorate's military from scratch, we will have to start recruiting officers for our High Command as well. Lysia has drawn up a list of friends and colleagues from her time serving on the Queen's General Staff, and we will start headhunting them to serve as generals in our autonomous high command - the Ostkommando."
MAN_army_5:0 "Gas-mask Masquerade"
MAN_army_5_desc:0 ""
MAN_army_6b:0 "A Native Panzercorps"
MAN_army_6b_desc:0 "It took a little convincing, but after consulting the numbers even the staunchest of our officers agree. We need more soldiers to cover the Protectorate's large territory, and to do that not only we are going to need local levies, but also a hard core of armoured units to crush any organised resistance. To this end General Dairyn has come to Manehattan, bringing with him his panzers to bolster our forces."
MAN_army_6a:0 "Urban Redoubts"
MAN_army_6a_desc:0 "As we clean up the city, our engineering drones have also rebuilt some now useless structures into small fortresses within which a platoon or so of Changelings can be comfortably housed. For safety, of course. We envision that such fortifications be present in every population centre of note, so as to better enshrine the presence of our garrisons all over the Protectorate."
MAN_beginning_2_1:0 "Forays into Menticide"
MAN_beginning_2_1_desc:0 ""
MAN_beginning_4a:0 "Auxiliary Battalions"
MAN_beginning_4a_desc:0 "Any good army needs special bodies of armed 'lings - and as it seems now, pony auxiliaries - suited for tasks the average platoon simply cannot do well. Recon, construction, siegeworks, you name it."
MAN_beginning_4b:0 "Good Business"
MAN_beginning_4b_desc:0 "What's good for the Protectorate is what's good for you! Or that's what they say. Keep your head down, pay your dues, bring in the cash. The Protectorate smiles on the industrious."
MAN_beginning_4c:0 "Institutionalise the Constabulary"
MAN_beginning_4c_desc:0 "Law and Order is starting to become a problem. We've told Protector Lysia, but honestly she seemed kind of... hungover? She's handpicked one of her pony cronies to be in charge of the collaborationist Constabulary, who will immediately set about recruiting and arming Changeling-loyal pony paramilitaries."
MAN_beginning_4d:0 "Centralise the Collaboration"
MAN_beginning_4d_desc:0 "We've got a whole network of informants and collaborators, but right now a lot of them are in six dozen disorganized file boxes of notes. Lysia pawns organzing the ponies off to her least favorite aide."
MAN_beginning_2a:0 "The Registry Bureau"
MAN_beginning_2a_desc:0 "As much as she tries to spin it as a good thing, Protector Lysia knows that there's just no way to make getting every pony in town registered and listed sounds fun, or non-threatening."
MAN_beginning_2b:0 "Muzzle the Academia"
MAN_beginning_2b_desc:0 "The Manehattan Intelligensia are obnoxious, as they were before our arrival. But now they're starting to turn their gaze on us, holding talks and potentially even aiding the ELF. Which doesn't exist, for the record."
MAN_beginning_2c:0 "Negotiate the Love Tax"
MAN_beginning_2c_desc:0 "It's simple, really. Changelings need love to survive. Ponies make love just, like, automatically. Ponies also don't want the Protectorate to bother them much. Think of your day-per-month as a kind of donation. But maintaining the strict quotas for Love imposed on us from Vesalipolis takes up a lot of our manpower and resources, so Lysia will get Queen Chrysalis to revamp the taxation system."
MAN_beginning_2d:0 "The Economic Frontier"
MAN_beginning_2d_desc:0 "Changeling economics is based on Changeling culture and lifestyle, but these things have gone straight out the window in the territories. All the territories are experimenting, and Manehattan is no exception."
MAN_beginning_2e:0 "Pick their Brains"
MAN_beginning_2e_desc:0 "Hypothetically, if we *could* read your brain, which we can't, we of course wouldn't find anything incriminating. Right? Of course not. We're all friends here."
MAN_beginning_2f:0 "Internal Passport Plan"
MAN_beginning_2f_desc:0 "Passports! They get you places! What is the next borough over but a small country with its own vibrant culture and also tightly controlled access points and borders? It's very orderly, at least."
MAN_beginning_2g:0 "Hearts and Minds"
MAN_beginning_2g_desc:0 "Lysia thinks of herself as a Changeling of the people. Ponies. Whatever. Perhaps making the ponies fear us less will result in a more malleable populace to govern. We'll test this concept out with "Hug a Changeling" day."
MAN_beginning_2h:0 "Rewriting History"
MAN_beginning_2h_desc:0 "In the beginning, wicked alicorns came down from on high to do battle for the cities of the plain, and smote many a pony. They laid a terrible curse on all ponykind, one not lifted until recently by a beautiful Queen."
MAN_beginning_2i:0 "Indoctrination Program"
MAN_beginning_2i_desc:0 "How much of the indoctrination's success is real, and how much of it is a cyncial fakery to get through the day? And does it even matter? Who knows! Praise Chrysalis."
MAN_beginning_2j:0 "Instate Military Law"
MAN_beginning_2j_desc:0 "While martial law in some form has been the norm in Manehattan for as long as we've been here, it is only now that we have codified it into a more reasonable and sustainable form. Just as well, because we're going to have to set a whole lot of new legal precedents for a prickly court case."
MAN_beginning_2k:0 "Conscript the Scientists"
MAN_beginning_2k_desc:0 "A scientist is a soldier in the army of progress! Terrible slogan, but also exactly what our new programs believe. The old eggheads are the new R&D, and we've provided swanky living and clean labs for a lifetime."
MAN_beginning_4e:0 "Amp Up Military Production"
MAN_beginning_4e_desc:0 "To build up a larger force drawn from Changeling settlers and pony collaborators means more guns. We need to ramp up production in order to supply ourselves, but also to be an arsenal for all of the hives if need be. Protectress Lysia believes that an inspection of collaborator-run military factories is in order to make sure our quotas are being fulfilled."
UNUSED:0 "Reorganise the Manehattan Police"
UNUSED_desc:0 "As fun as direct rule by hoofboot is, it isn't very stable. To that end, the Manehattan PD lives again, this time quite firmly in the service of the Protectorate government."
MAN_beginning_4f:0 "The Inkognito-Division"
MAN_beginning_4f_desc:0 "The best and/or worst thing about Changelings is their ability to be anything, anyone, and anywhere. They are natural infiltrators, and even more natural sabatouers and spies. This preternatural ability served us well in the war, and shall serve us well in our victory. Commander Soryn, who in the war had led one of our best infiltrator divisions, has come to share with us her expertise - and she's bringing her boys along too."
MAN_beginning_5a:0 "Break their Codes"
MAN_beginning_5a_desc:0 "Even as we firmly deny the existence of the E.L.F., we have struggled to break their airtight security for far too long. We must make progress."
MAN_beginning_5b:0 "The Spyeye Program"
MAN_beginning_5b_desc:0 "In true Changeling fashion, we have created the next evolution in state surveillance. The concept of an all-seeing, omniscient security apparatus is truly the best idea we could have ever asked for, and we did in fact explicitly ask for it. Smile for the camera."
MAN_beginning_5c:0 "The Resistance is Us"
MAN_beginning_5d:0 "For Your Own Good"
MAN_beginning_5e:0 "A Surveillance State"
MAN_beginning_5e_desc:0 "Control is a holistic thing. To have total control, you must first know everything. Every step, every thought, and every action the subject takes must rest firmly in the frog of your hoof."
MAN_beginning_5f:0 "Horse Tranquilizers"
MAN_beginning_5f_desc:0 "Isn't all this fuss and discontent so... tiring? Relax. Have some water! Your compliance is mandatory, but its also beneficial. Our burden is easy, and our yoke is always light."

The former Wonderbolts officer and establishment figure Wind Rider shall join us, commanding the collaborationist paramilitaries of the Equestrian Order of Pegasi Fascists."

Well, ladies and gentlecolts, may I present to you, our grandest and most elegant design for the ultimate ka-boom. Our overlords in Vesalipolis are reluctant to share with us their own research on the matter, but by catching up and perhaps surpassing them in the atomic arms race we can further assert our independence."

Hard data on the V.F.D.'s history and influence is scant, but from what we know, the Vigintivirate is a powerful organisation with roots in Equestria stretching back centuries.

MAN_ELF.1205.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Early this morning citizens of the Protectorate Manehattan awoke to the sounds of screams and gunfire as pony resistance elements took to the streets in running battles with Changeling and Collaborationist forces in what is now considered to be mass spontaneous civil unrest in regions across the Protectorate. This eruption of seditious activity on such a large scale is alleged to be the first coordinated effort by the so-called "Harmonic Resistance" active on the eastern Equestrian seaboard. Hitherto unsubstantiated reports coming from sources in the Changeling administration allege that the "Harmonic Resistance" is in fact led by none other than the ponies known as "Starlight Glimmer" and "Trixie Lulamoon" - the former the progenitor of the failed ideology dubbed "Equalism", and the latter a washed-out street magician. Additional reporting to follow as further details emerge."

MAN_ELF.1206.d_hascore:0 "The inability of our commanders to prepare for the inevitability of what happened in [MAN_uprising_in_state_event_target.GetName] was just disgraceful, but at least we had managed to cling on to power in the state. Most importantly, the fact that we were still able, unprepared as we had been, to put down the unrest meant that the legitimacy of our governance over the Protectorate was still uncontested thus far.\n\nWe may have weathered the storm today, but the reports of our infiltrator agents in the field point towards a rising trend in anti-Changeling, pro-Harmonic, and secessionist thought amongst the general population of the Protectorate. Similar waves of unrest akin to what happened in the [MAN_uprising_in_state_event_target.GetName] region are certainties that we are sure to experience in the coming months.\n\nWe must stand against the tide and protect the Motherland from the pony rabble that would seek to destroy the hard-earned fruits of our conquest."
MAN_ELF.1206.d_lostcore:0 "The inability of our commanders to prepare for the inevitability of what happened in [MAN_uprising_in_state_event_target.GetName] was just disgraceful. The assessment of the extent of the damage caused to our administration is still in process, but it is undeniable that on a local level, the legitimacy of the Changeling mandate over the Manehattan Protectorate has been dealt a severe blow by our failure to put down the unrest.\n\nIn post-unrest [MAN_uprising_in_state_event_target.GetName], it is being reported that civilian ponies are flaunting the 9p.m. curfew with impunity, the local Collaborationists are facing regular harassment and intimidation, petty offenses against the Changeling garrison has increased dozenfold, and, most terrifyingly, from the reports of our infiltrator agents in the field, anti-Changeling, pro-Harmonic, and secessionist sentiments have experienced exponential, uninhibited growth.\n\nIn essence, Changeling authority over the [MAN_uprising_in_state_event_target.GetName] region has been crippled. The prospect of more unrest to come is extremely alarming, to say the least."

MAN_ELF.4.d:0 "In order for the Protectorate government to have any legitimacy with the people we must try to make ammends with them in one way or another. One proposal is the rebuilding of the famous Bronclyn bridge in Manehattan that took a severe battering when the victorious Changeling army occupied the city. On this issue two competing factions vie for supremacy; our more ardent militarists call for the demolition of what remains of the old bridge in favour of a wholly new edifice, built in the Changeling architectural tradition as an ode to our victory. The moderate (and perhaps more sensible) faction wishes to limit the construction work to a conservative restoration of the bridge to its original pre-war appearance."

The Protectress has initiated plans to redevelop the inner city, clearing out the slums and creating new neighbourhoods for Changeling settlement and industrial development.\n\nThe plan, though suitably ambitious, seems highly unfeasible at the moment. With our garrison overstretched and wholly incapable of pacifying dissent and unrest in Equestria's largest city, some of our officers have suggested enlisting the help of the pony collaborationists in our attempt to remake the city in our own image."
