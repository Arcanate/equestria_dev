#### LEADERS ####
LYSIA_DESC:0 "Trained at the prestigious Vesalipolis Military Academy, Lysia was nevertheless relegated to administrative duties working on the Queen's General Staff during the Great War against Equestria. Whilst her classmates achieved glory for the Changeling Lands on the battlefield, she was stuck in Vesalipolis kowtowing to Chrysalis. Her service to the Queen seemed to have paid off, though, as she was bestowed the title of Protector over the exalted metropolis of Manehattan following its conquest."

MAN_second_wing_1:0 "Building Bridges?"
MAN_second_wing_1_desc:0 "In order for the Protectorate government to have any legitimacy with the people we must try to make ammends with them in one way or another. One proposal is the rebuilding of a famous bridge in Manehattan that was destroyed when Changelings occupied the city."

MAN_second_wing_2a_desc:0 "With our occupation of Manehatten we aquired its large population and significant industrial base, though we also inheried all of its issues.

MAN_second_wing_2b_desc:0 "The iconic Maneway network is the vital infrastructure that knits Manehattan together, and under the pretense of repairing its battle-damaged lines, we will retool it to be an efficient means of dispatching our security forces all across the city - artillery, panzers, and all.
