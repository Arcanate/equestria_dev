#### LEADERS ####
LYSIA_DESC:0 "Trained at the prestigious Vesalipolis Military Academy, Lysia was nevertheless relegated to administrative duties working on the Queen's General Staff during the Great War against Equestria. Whilst her classmates achieved glory for the Changeling Lands on the battlefield, she was stuck in Vesalipolis kowtowing to Chrysalis. Her service to the Queen seemed to have paid off, though, as she was bestowed the title of Protectress over the exalted metropolis of Manehattan following its conquest."

MAN_second_wing_1:0 "Building Bridges?"
MAN_second_wing_1_desc:0 "In order for the Protectorate government to have any legitimacy with the people we must try to make ammends with them in one way or another. One proposal is the rebuilding of a famous bridge in Manehattan that was destroyed when Changelings occupied the city."
MAN_second_wing_2a:0 "The Urban Renewal Authority"
MAN_second_wing_2a_desc:0 "With our occupation of Manehatten we aquired its large population and significant industrial base, though we also inheried all of its issues. Foremost of which is the crowded urban environment and restive slums of the city. The Protectress has initiated plans to redevelop the inner city, clearing out the slums and creating new neighbourhoods for Changeling settlement and industrial development."
MAN_second_wing_2b:0 "Retool the Maneway"
MAN_second_wing_2b_desc:0 "The iconic Maneway network is the vital infrastructure that knits Manehattan together, and under the pretense of repairing its battle-damaged lines, we will retool it to be an efficient means of dispatching our security forces all across the city - artillery, panzers, and all.

MAN_ELF.1205.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Early this morning citizens of the Protectorate Manehattan awoke to the sounds of screams and gunfire as pony resistance elements took to the streets in running battles with Changeling and Collaborationist forces in what is now considered to be mass spontaneous civil unrest in regions across the Protectorate. This eruption of seditious activity on such a large scale is alleged to be the first coordinated effort by the so-called "Harmonic Resistance" active on the eastern Equestrian seaboard. Hitherto unsubstantiated reports coming from sources in the Changeling administration allege that the "Harmonic Resistance" is in fact led by none other than the ponies known as "Starlight Glimmer" and "Trixie Lulamoon" - the former the progenitor of the failed ideology dubbed "Equalism", and the latter a washed-out street magician. Additional reporting to follow as further details emerge."

MAN_ELF.1206.d_hascore:0 "The inability of our commanders to prepare for the inevitability of what happened in [MAN_uprising_in_state_event_target.GetName] was just disgraceful, but at least we had managed to cling on to power in the state. Most importantly, the fact that we were still able, unprepared as we had been, to put down the unrest meant that the legitimacy of our governance over the Protectorate was still uncontested thus far.\n\nWe may have weathered the storm today, but the reports of our infiltrator agents in the field point towards a rising trend in anti-Changeling, pro-Harmonic, and secessionist thought amongst the general population of the Protectorate. Similar waves of unrest akin to what happened in the [MAN_uprising_in_state_event_target.GetName] region are certainties that we are sure to experience in the coming months.\n\nWe must stand against the tide and protect the Motherland from the pony rabble that would seek to destroy the hard-earned fruits of our conquest."
MAN_ELF.1206.d_lostcore:0 "The inability of our commanders to prepare for the inevitability of what happened in [MAN_uprising_in_state_event_target.GetName] was just disgraceful. The assessment of the extent of the damage caused to our administration is still in process, but it is undeniable that on a local level, the legitimacy of the Changeling mandate over the Manehattan Protectorate has been dealt a severe blow by our failure to put down the unrest.\n\nIn post-unrest [MAN_uprising_in_state_event_target.GetName], it is being reported that civilian ponies are flaunting the 9p.m. curfew with impunity, the local Collaborationists are facing regular harassment and intimidation, petty offenses against the Changeling garrison has increased dozenfold, and, most terrifyingly, from the reports of our infiltrator agents in the field, anti-Changeling, pro-Harmonic, and secessionist sentiments have experienced exponential, uninhibited growth.\n\nIn essence, Changeling authority over the [MAN_uprising_in_state_event_target.GetName] region has been crippled. The prospect of more unrest to come is extremely alarming, to say the least."
