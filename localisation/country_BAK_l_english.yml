That they may never feel the weight of tyranny on their shoulders and may be free from the chains that still hold them!"\n\nBray Foam's continued speech brought on cheers and shouts from the assembled crowd of ponies in the dock district of Bakara city. ZDS rallies had recently intensified throughout the city in the runup to the 1007 election, setting many in the town on edge. As the communists rallied, other Bakaran citizens looked on in a mix of interest, curiosity, and fear.\n\nBray Foam's speech began to reach a crescendo, riling the crowd into even further frenzy\n\n"And so our nation may reforge itself in the flame of socialism and make for itself a new future in a nation, and eventually a coalition of our own making!"\n\nFoam's remarks about the coalition worried many in other segments of society, especially the merchant classes of the city. They warn the government to try to prohibit Foam from making many of these speeches again, advising his radical foreign policy may cause a rift with the nation's allies. But just as well, many politicians point to the enshrined right to public gatherings that Bakara holds, and that trying to clamp down on Foam may simply incite further violence.\n\nWhatever the choice is, the ZDS seems set to gain."
bakara.5.a:0 "It is their Democratic right!"
bakara.5.b:0 "Order them to cease with their nonsense!"

bakara.6.t:0 "Radio "Bakarska Enotnost""
bakara.6.d:0 ""And so remember citizens of Bakara, always stay vigilant, be ready to defend your nation, and stand up those who would tear apart out traditions."\n\nWater Lily sits in her office, tapping her hoof on the desk. The closing remarks of the new BFZ radio show are worrying. They now functioned as a significant political force for the upcoming election, and this radio channel could spread their ideas and further normalize them to the public. The BFZ's meteoric rise threatened the establishment of both of Bakara's center parties, and they seemed to be going all out for the 1007 runoff. This radio show, for now only localized to the Bakara urban area, seemed to be one of their primary efforts.\n\nWater Lily faced a difficult choice. Let the show remain, and risk losing support in the election, but possibly damage her rivals in the BSP as well. Or she could put her hoof down, trying to limit the reach of the program, curtailing their scope to the broader Bakaran public, but also provoking more extreme responses in turn.\n\nBakara's democracy was certainly not in an enviable position."

bakara.7.t:0 "The Battle Of Codd Street"
bakara.7.d:0 ""Rally now, oh Bakarans! Your nation calls to you!"\n\nThe call went out over the radio to members of the BFZ across the city of Bakara. Enflamed by a rumor that the ZDS was planning to hold a rally out front of the BFZ headquarters, Radio Bakarska Enotnost called on all of its supporters to coalesce at the party office, and the crowd obeyed the call.\n\nOnce there, the crowd milled about with no aim. The spontaneous counter-demonstration had nothing to act against, and so they created themselves a target, one earth pony in the crowd shouted,\n\nIf the reds won't come to us, let's go to them!"\n\nAnd so the march on 37 Codd street, the ZDS central office began. As news filtered across the city, various worker groups left their jobs and arrived at Codd street, and eventually, Bray Foam appeared as well. He called on all ZDS members to block the "destructive riot" from reaching Codd street.\n\nAnd at the same time, police units began to mobilize.\n\nAs the BFZ crowd approached Codd street, they came face to face along the intersection of Codd and Mareywether. By now, the police had arrived. But they stayed away from the heart of the protest not wishing to incite further violence.\n\nBut as the crowds came face to face, one colt picked up a rock, and threw. The BFZ began to advance, trying to push the ZDS back to their office, and police tried to keep order.\n\nOne last push is made by the advancing crowd to make it through, but at the end of the day..."

bakara.8.d:0 ""As you can clearly see by the events that transpired on Codd street a few days ago, the SDH government does not have the resources or the will to curb the violence growing in our nation! Water Lily has proven herself incapable of handling the current national crisis!"\n\nTea Dip stood at the door to a popular restaurant in Bakara, holding an impromptu press meeting with reporters, wanting to know her view about the recent conflict at Codd Street.\n\n"I tell you, she couldn't solve an issue like that if the march were towards the presidential residence. But I must be going now..."\n\n"What would you do then?" One reporter shouted from the crowd.\n\nTea Dip paused, "I suppose I would ask the Marines to intervene. I wonder if Miss Lily would have the courage to do that", "I mean you could ask her" the reporter snapped. Smiling softly to herself, Tea Dip replied, "That sounds like a great idea. Here's a story for your papers. I challenge Water Lily to civil debate on all matters of national policy. I hope to see her there."\n\nTea Dip trotted away to her car with the throng of reporters following her, only leaving the reporter that had questioned Tea Dip left. Looking out towards the vehicle driving away, Water Lily raised the brim on her hat, "A debate, huh? I guess that's how she is playing it." Putting her hat back down, she disappeared into the urban Bakaran night..."

bakara.10.d:0 "Word comes to us today that Rift Strain, a well-known agitator with ties to the BFZ, was found dead last night in what is suspected to be a politically motivated assassination. The incident took place outside her residence in Vetailje, and the identity of the assailant is still unknown at this time. In response, BFZ candidate Firm Scow has released the following statement:\n\n"Rift Strain was a brave pony, outspoken in her love of liberty and an unflinching champion of the downtrodden, who was abruptly taken from us in a despicable and cowardly way. In light of this loss, we must not allow her cause to fade from our memories. She knew better than anypony that the River Coalition is not to be trusted. As she so famously wrote: 'It is a hypocritical institution not worthy of our faith, an institution which has given free reign to slavers and despots, and an institution which sits idly and stays silent while evil festers within it.'\n\n"She made it her mission to warn us that if we do nothing, there will come a time when all ponies of virtue are crushed beneath an iron hoof of injustice. Ponies like Tea Dip and Water Lily tragically refuse to heed this warning. And so it is my solemn pledge to Rift Strain's memory that, if elected, my first act will be to formally withdraw our Republic from the corrupt River Coalition, so that we may lay the foundation of a new, truly righteous order for the Riverlands.""

Bakara must free itself from the shackles it finds itself in one way or another. Long live Bakara, and thank you."\n\nThe Admiral slowly left the stage of the Navy press briefing held in Vetailje, leaving the reporters stunned at what they had just heard. The Navy had always been crucial to the nation's defense, and now its most respected Admiral openly berated the new government.\n\nStepping into a car outside the Naval port, Cobalt Wind took her seat beside the commander of the Republican Marine, Pearl Diver.\n\nThe Marine general took a deep breath and said, "Are we really planning this? All reports say their election victory was legitimate."\n\n"The Other parties will rally to us, we can not let Bakara fall into the clutches of those who would see her ruined and absorbed by a regime lead by that lump of griffon food" Cobalt scuffed\n\nPearl again sighed, "the Marines will be ready when you give the signal admiral, we either free Bakara from her oppressors or we will die trying.\n\nHave some faith Pearl, the BFZ will never agree with their arch-rivals controlling the nation, the BSP could never stand for any idea of union with the other Coalition nations, and on principle, the SDH will not abide by any threat to democracy. The reds will be completely alone, Bray Foam is probably shaking in his suit while he grovels to his master Haze to try to save him, what a pathetic sight it must be."\n\n"I'd be careful how you word some of your rhetoric," Pearl remarked profoundly, "I am no more of a politician than you, but I advise that if you are to try and lead this nation, you must try to unify it, not simply berate your opponents with insults"\n\nCobalt looked out into the cold Bakaran seas, "Perhaps you are right, but a nation is like a ship, all its parts must be well oiled, but right now there is a pile of dung sitting in the captain's chair that I must remove"\n\n"You certainly have more confidence than me" Pearl joked\n\nThe Admiral looked the general in his eyes and said..."
