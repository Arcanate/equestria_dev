BAK_dealing_with_reactonaries_desc:0 "We must act swiftly to deal with reactionary elements within the Bakaran government. If left alone, these elements may plot to undermine the rule of the working class and foment counter-revolution."
BAK_rehabilitation_and_cooperation:0 "Mercy, Rehabilitation and Cooperation"

BAK_to_the_work_camps_desc:0 "Socially dangerous elements still infest our government and wider political system; these disloyal elements must be isolated and neutralised.

BAK_coopt_the_military:0 "A Slap on the Hoof"
BAK_coopt_the_military_desc:0 "Some within the military have voiced skepticism towards socialism in the past, but many other officers have expressed support towards our agenda.

BAK_purge_the_military_desc:0 "As long as the Bakaran military maintains an independent ideology and power base, they will represent an unacceptable threat to the development of socialism.

BAK_military_commissars:0 "Found the VK" #Vojaški komisariat/Military commissariat
BAK_military_commissars_desc:0 "Surveillance of the civilian populace is a tactic of oppressive regimes that deny their people freedom.

BAK_judicial_socialisation_desc:0 "Bakara's republican legal codes are severely out of date for a modern society, and especially for a socialist one.

BAK_socialist_culture:0 "The Cultural Revolution"
BAK_socialist_culture_desc:0 "While Bakra's traditions of Republicanism are something socialists can look back on with pride, it is tainted by the effects of years of capitalist control and the evil influence of foreign powers who saw our system as a threat.

BAK_economic_reorganisation:0 "The Economic Revolution"
BAK_economic_reorganisation_desc:0 "It is time to embark on our great economic reform of the nation! Socialism shall, of course, be the main focus, but branching out from there, we have many paths regarding how to proceed.

BAK_homes_for_the_people:0 "Nopony Left Behind"
BAK_homes_for_the_people_desc:0 "One of the great issues that has plagued Bakara recently is its rapidly growing population. Nowadays, there is a large urban class that is either homeless or living on the very edge of bankruptcy. We draw a large base of support from this class, and so it is time we address their needs. New housing and social programs shall be implemented to assist these poor citizens."
BAK_peoples_railways:0 "Found the LKI" #Ljudski komisariat za infrastrukturu/People's Commissariat For Infrastructure
BAK_peoples_railways_desc:0 "Another pressing issue for all Bakarans is the lack of paved roads across the country.

BAK_educating_the_populace:0 "Revolutionary Science"
BAK_educating_the_populace_desc:0 "Science and knowledge are one of the great backbones of our revolution! As our citizens learn more and more about the greatness of socialism and the successes of its political and economic system, our nation shall grow stronger by the day."

And the idea of Socialist materialism is a good start, we shall value material progress made by our society over all other things."
BAK_the_economic_plan:0 "Reorganising the Economy"
BAK_the_economic_plan_desc:0 "As we move towards our socialist economic model, we need to decide on a direction towards which we shall aim our economy. Two ponies have each produced a plan of their own, and it is time to decide between them."
BAK_planned_economy:0 "Centralised Planning"
BAK_planned_economy_desc:0 "Orthodox revolutionary policy recommends a state-directed economic model from which we can better gear the nation up to increase production and streamline needless industrial bureaucracy.

BAK_on_the_matters_of_economics_desc:0 "Social and political instability has left the economy teetering on the brink of disaster.

BAK_state_unions:0 "Create the NZD" #Nacionalno združenje delavcev/National Worker Association
BAK_state_unions_desc:0 "It is time we did something about the troublesome trade unions; their socialist agitation has been extremely disruptive to the Bakaran economy.

BAK_scientific_advancement:0 "Restoring The Bakaran Academia"

BAK_unite_the_army_fascist_desc:0 "The armies of the formerly independent Riverlander states will have to be united as soon as possible. This will be no easy task, as difficulties related to linguistic differences or old political rivalries are just a few of the obstacles we must account for."
BAK_unite_the_culture_fascist:0 "A True Riverlander Culture"
BAK_unite_the_culture_fascist_desc:0 "The old corrupt rulers of the Riverlands did their best to keep us separated and stymie the development of pan-Riverlander identity. This shall no longer be the case. We must take steps to nurture a shared culture and promote Riverlander unity."
BAK_integrate_economies_fascist:0 "Economic Reconstruction"

That they may never feel the weight of tyranny on their shoulders and may be free from the chains that still hold them!"\n\nBray Foam's continued speech brought on cheers and shouts from the assembled crowd of ponies in the dock district of Bakara city. ZDS rallies had recently intensified throughout the city in the runup to the 1007 election, setting many in the town on edge. As the communists rallied, other Bakaran citizens looked on in a mix of interest, curiosity, and fear.\n\nBray Foam's speech began to reach a crescendo, riling the crowd into even further frenzy\n\n"And so our nation may reforge itself in the flame of socialism and make for itself a new future in a nation, and eventually a coalition of our own making!"\n\nFoam's remarks about the coalition worried many in other segments of society, especially the merchant classes of the city. They warn the government to try to prohibit Foam from making many of these speeches again, advising his radical foreign policy may cause a rift with the nation's allies. But just as well, many politicians point to the enshrined right to public gatherings that Bakara holds, and that trying to clamp down on Foam may simply incite further violence.\n\nWhatever the choice is, the ZDS seems set to gain."

The closing remarks of the new BFZ radio show are worrying. They now functioned as a significant political force for the upcoming election, and this radio channel could spread their ideas and further normalize them to the public. The BFZ's meteoric rise threatened the establishment of both of Bakara's center parties, and they seemed to be going all out for the 1007 runoff. This radio show, for now only localized to the Bakara urban area, seemed to be one of their primary efforts.\n\nWater Lily faced a difficult choice. Let the show remain, and risk losing support in the election, but possibly damage her rivals in the BSP as well. Or she could put her hoof down, trying to limit the reach of the program, curtailing their scope to the broader Bakaran public, but also provoking more extreme responses in turn.\n\nBakara's democracy was certainly not in an enviable position."

Enflamed by a rumor that the ZDS was planning to hold a rally out front of the BFZ headquarters, Radio Bakarska Enotnost called on all of its supporters to coalesce at the party office, and the crowd obeyed the call.\n\nOnce there, the crowd milled about with no aim. The spontaneous counter-demonstration had nothing to act against, and so they created themselves a target, one earth pony in the crowd shouted,\n\nIf the reds won't come to us, let's go to them!"\n\nAnd so the march on 37 Codd street, the ZDS central office began. As news filtered across the city, various worker groups left their jobs and arrived at Codd street, and eventually, Bray Foam appeared as well. He called on all ZDS members to block the "destructive riot" from reaching Codd street.\n\nAnd at the same time, police units began to mobilize.\n\nAs the BFZ crowd approached Codd street, they came face to face along the intersection of Codd and Mareywether. By now, the police had arrived. But they stayed away from the heart of the protest not wishing to incite further violence.\n\nBut as the crowds came face to face, one colt picked up a rock, and threw. The BFZ began to advance, trying to push the ZDS back to their office, and police tried to keep order.\n\nOne last push is made by the advancing crowd to make it through, but at the end of the day..."

But I must be going now..."\n\n"What would you do then?" One reporter shouted from the crowd.\n\nTea Dip paused, "I suppose I would ask the Marines to intervene. I wonder if Miss Lily would have the courage to do that", "I mean you could ask her" the reporter snapped. Smiling softly to herself, Tea Dip replied, "That sounds like a great idea. Here's a story for your papers. I challenge Water Lily to civil debate on all matters of national policy. I hope to see her there."\n\nTea Dip trotted away to her car with the throng of reporters following her, only leaving the reporter that had questioned Tea Dip left. Looking out towards the vehicle driving away, Water Lily raised the brim on her hat, "A debate, huh? I guess that's how she is playing it."

The incident took place outside her residence in Vetailje, and the identity of the assailant is still unknown at this time. In response, BFZ candidate Firm Scow has released the following statement:\n\n"Rift Strain was a brave pony, outspoken in her love of liberty and an unflinching champion of the downtrodden, who was abruptly taken from us in a despicable and cowardly way. In light of this loss, we must not allow her cause to fade from our memories. She knew better than anypony that the River Coalition is not to be trusted. As she so famously wrote: 'It is a hypocritical institution not worthy of our faith, an institution which has given free reign to slavers and despots, and an institution which sits idly and stays silent while evil festers within it.'\n\n"She made it her mission to warn us that if we do nothing, there will come a time when all ponies of virtue are crushed beneath an iron hoof of injustice. Ponies like Tea Dip and Water Lily tragically refuse to heed this warning. And so it is my solemn pledge to Rift Strain's memory that, if elected, my first act will be to formally withdraw our Republic from the corrupt River Coalition, so that we may lay the foundation of a new, truly righteous order for the Riverlands.""

In a few minutes, she was set to go out and make a speech to a crowd of waiting citizens, and tell them her plans as their new leader. She straightened her tie. Not too casual, not too formal. Today she was the mare who needed to appeal to all Bakarans, not just her supporters. An aide brought her a cup of coffee, and she slowly sipped it. Her staff bustled about outside her office, preparing. Some feared a ZDS attack, but she knew that Foam wouldn't do anything that brazen.\n\nAn exhausted stallion entered. "Miss Scow, It's time."\n\nFirm sauntered out to her balcony, overlooking the crowd. Many of the closer ones cheered with enthusiasm, but many of those further back darted their eyes back and forth in worry. Many still considered her a radical, after all. Opening her mouth, she began to speak.\n\n"Ponies of Bakara! I am grateful for the chance you have given me to lead you into the future. We are at a turning point in our history, where the strong shall step above the weak and forge a new nation. Currently, our society is bound, held down by the elites who worship the River Coalition, but they have lost sight of its purpose! If they truly wished for Riverlands unity, they would bring the states together to create a greater destiny for all! But no, they want to control our nation from afar! They leave us as puppets to their establishment, which is now filled with monarchists and slavers! They let in those who would control and extort their own people! They try to separate the ponies of the Riverlands! To prevent us from achieving our true destiny of unification and the banishing of the old and corrupt order! I have fought for years to try to gain unity for the ponies, the dogs, and all the other citizens of the Riverlands! In this fight, I have seen the corruption of the establishment—how it lies through its teeth, how it says it wishes for "common prosperity." This is a lie. Their so-called “prosperity” is little more than slavery! It is submission to monarchs, it is domination by elites who care not for the common stallion or mare! I know they will not accept reason. With this, I declare that Bakra will no longer participate in the corrupt union that tries to control us. And that it shall be the goal of this nation to create a new union! A superior union! That shall unite all the Riverponies to achieve our true destiny! We shall enter a new era of greatness and opportunities! The coalition of Rijektograd has abandoned their mandate to bring together all the ponies of the east! And now Bakara must bear it! The dream of Riverland unity lives on in Bakara! Long live Bakara!

Bakara must free itself from the shackles it finds itself in one way or another. Long live Bakara, and thank you."\n\nThe Admiral slowly left the stage of the Navy press briefing held in Vetailje, leaving the reporters stunned at what they had just heard. The Navy had always been crucial to the nation's defense, and now its most respected Admiral openly berated the new government.\n\nStepping into a car outside the Naval port, Cobalt Wind took her seat beside the commander of the Republican Marine, Pearl Diver.\n\nThe Marine general took a deep breath and said, "Are we really planning this? All reports say their election victory was legitimate."\n\n"The Other parties will rally to us, we can not let Bakara fall into the clutches of those who would see her ruined and absorbed by a regime lead by that lump of griffon food" Cobalt scuffed\n\nPearl again sighed, "the Marines will be ready when you give the signal admiral, we either free Bakara from her oppressors or we will die trying.\n\nHave some faith Pearl, the BFZ will never agree with their arch-rivals controlling the nation, the BSP could never stand for any idea of union with the other Coalition nations, and on principle, the SDH will not abide by any threat to democracy. The reds will be completely alone, Bray Foam is probably shaking in his suit while he grovels to his master Haze to try to save him, what a pathetic sight it must be."\n\n"I'd be careful how you word some of your rhetoric," Pearl remarked profoundly, "I am no more of a politician than you, but I advise that if you are to try and lead this nation, you must try to unify it, not simply berate your opponents with insults"\n\nCobalt looked out into the cold Bakaran seas, "Perhaps you are right, but a nation is like a ship, all its parts must be well oiled, but right now there is a pile of dung sitting in the captain's chair that I must remove"\n\n"You certainly have more confidence than me" Pearl joked\n\nThe Admiral looked the general in his eyes and said..."

Maybe I will actualy get some sleep tonight.", he chucked to himself.\n\n"What about the Admiral sir?", an aid commented.\n\n"Cobalt Wind? She may have influence over the Navy, but we control the government now, and plus, her ships are not enough to remove us alone."\n\nAt this, a militiapony burst into the party office dashing towards Bray.

I'm most likely putting my life on the line here for your little maneuver, and you are out here sightseeing?! Can I have some explanation?"\n\nThe Admiral said nothing for a moment and then replied, "They say some days you can see Greneclyf from there shores. I haven't personally, but I like to take it as a metaphor, if nothing else. We here in the Navy always look forward to bigger things than petty political squabbles. And now it is time to put that philosophy into action."\n\n"Oh in the name of all that is good, stop it with the esoteric griffon-dung. You are the head of a coup here. You have my financial support, Firm Scow is out somewhere gathering the rest of her militia, and Water Lily isn't going to be an issue. You told us all you have a plan.

Now it is relatively simple, the Kovačinaši will push up on land, and the commies will engage them, then me the Peal Diver will sweep into Bakara proper on my capital ship with the Marines, and arrest Bray Foam.

At this, the crowd stomped enthusiastically.\n\n"But not just for Bakara!" She raised a hoof emphatically. "We must foster the communal spirit of all creatures throughout the Riverlands, for we are all bound together by our eternal values and by our shared struggle against Griffonian Imperialism. Achieving this will necessitate slaying the morally bankrupt River Coalition." She brought her hoof down forcefully on the podium as the crowd booed and jeered at the mention of the Coalition.\n\n"The Riverlands are in crisis. The ponies must be saved from their current state of disintegration and injustice." Beads of sweat began to drip down Firm Scow's face: a result of her fervour. "It falls to us to combat the menace and unite them under a truly righteous banner. We shall see the Riverlands reborn!" Firm Scow raised her hoof high in the air. In response, the ponies in the crowd raised theirs as well, cheering uproariously."
