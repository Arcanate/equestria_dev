FIR_shinespark_desc:0 "The notorious rogue mage, Shinespark, has returned from exile in the North. Shinespark has spent the intervening time studying magic of the foulest and darkest kind, and has attracted a cadre of disciples devoted to her ideas of unicorn supremacy. Bloody rebellion is all but certain."
FIR_harmony_wins:0 "A Victory For Harmony"
FIR_harmony_wins_desc:0 "After a short but bitter war, Shinespark's forces have been routed, and she has been captured. The Grand Elder will soon decide her fate, but for now, peace returns to the land."
FIR_shinespark_wins:0 "A Victory For Shinespark"

FIR_shinespark_trial_desc:0 "Shinespark has been captured, and brought before the whole people of Firtree. In front of all, the Elder pronounces his judgment - that her sins are scarlet, and that the only recompense possible for such grave evil is death."
FIR_promote_harmony:0 "Promote Harmony"
FIR_promote_harmony_desc:0 "Shinespark's poisonous ideology has created a terrible rift in our society. By trying to turn unicorns and non-magic users against each other, she has inflicted deep wounds on our society. We must be better than she would have been. We must rebuild the harmony of our people, and heal this rift."
FIR_rebuild_villages:0 "Rebuild the Villages"
FIR_rebuild_villages_desc:0 "The fighting in the recent war has taken a brutal toll on the villages of Firtrees. Loyalist warriors and Golden-Horns alike raided and seized supplies from farmers, and engaged in brutal reprisals against those perceived to be helping the other side. We must undo this damage."

FIR.1.t:0 "Shinespark's Return"
FIR.1.d:0 "The notorious mage, Shinespark, was exiled from Firtree for advocating that magic-users should rule over non-magical ponies. Though we thought she would surely perish in the North, she did not, and has learned many foul magics. She has gathered a cadre of like-minded followers, and has returned to her ancestral home in order to seize power. Blood and strife have descended upon Firtree, as they have not done in an age."
FIR.1.a:0 "The Great Elder will save us from this madness!"
FIR.1.b:0 "Unicorns are the superior race!"
FBK.2.t:0 "Power Struggles within the Council"
FBK.2.d:0 "The Council has rejected the experienced leadership of Cenhelm - but who will they choose to replace him?"
FBK.2.a:0 "The Communists have some interesting ideas - let's invite them into the Council"
FBK.2.b:0 "Chief Gering shows promise - he will lead us through this difficult time"
FBK.3.t:0 "A Proposal From The East"
FBK.3.d:0 "An pony envoy sought an audience with the Regent today, and offered a most interesting proposal. She claimed to come from the far east, from a backwards nation called Farbrook. We recognised the name as one of the clans of savages that the Knightly Orders have been charged with guarding our Eastern border from for centuries now. The envoy claimed that Farbrook regrets their history of animosity with us, and claims her leader, Hermane Gering, asks for help. Gering wishes to unite the Ponies of the Eastern Hills and plains, but the River Federation is posing a major obstacle to this, and he asks for our aid in defeating them. In exchange, Gering offers his obedience to the crown, offering the Eastern lands to us if we will but allow him to administrate them."
FBK.3.a:0 "Offer him weapons and technical assistants. We have much to gain and little to lose"
FBK.3.b:0 "We are not interested in the affairs of savages"
FBK.4.t:0 "Divide and Conquer"
FBK.4.d:0 "A messenger came from the frigid North today. He claimed to speak on behalf of Hermane Gering, Chieftain of the hillponies of Farbrook. Chieftain Gering is offering us a simple deal: agree to go to war with the Federation alongside Gering, and we will be granted a large chunk of the spoils, gaining access to the rich floodplains and FBKmlands of the River Valleys. What will our response be?"
FBK.4.a:0 "The lands are fertile...tell him we accept"
FBK.4.b:0 "This isn't in our best interest"
FBK.5.t:0 "Divide and Conquer"
FBK.5.d:0 "A messenger came from the frigid North today. He claimed to speak on behalf of Hermane Gering, Chieftain of the hillponies of Farbrook. Chieftain Gering is offering us a simple deal: agree to go to war with the Federation alongside Gering, and we will be granted a large chunk of the spoils, gaining access to the rich floodplains and FBKmlands of the River Valleys. What will our response be?"
FBK.5.a:0 "The lands are fertile...tell him we accept"
FBK.5.b:0 "This isn't in our best interest"
FBK.6.t:0 "The Empire is Interested"
FBK.6.d:0 "Our messenger arrived from Griffonheim yesterday, with excellent news - the Empire has accepted our offer. Military advisors, weapons, and personnel will be delivered to us for the war effort, though the Empire is not willing to commit itself personally to a war in the East. Of course, they DO expect our pledge of alleigance in exchange..."
FBK.6.a:0 "Of course, of course, whatever they want"
FBK.7.t:0 "Imperial Scorn"
FBK.7.d:0 "Ill news has returned to us this day: the Empire is not interested in helping us against the Federation. They are unwilling to commit themselves to a war in the East without better hope of a profit for themselves."
FBK.7.a:0 "We will have to look elsewhere"
FBK.8.t:0 "The Gryphian Host signs the River Pact"
FBK.8.d:0 "Excellent news! The Gryphian Host has agreed to our terms, and will attack the Federation alongside us. However, they will demand part of the Federation's land in exchange for this."
FBK.8.a:0 "I can already hear Lake City burning!"
FBK.9.t:0 "The Gryphian Host isn't interested"
FBK.9.d:0 "Sad news came from the South today - the Gryphian Host refused to join our offensive pact to partition the River Federation."
FBK.9.a:0 "Never trust a Griffon!"
FBK.10.t:0 "The Zebras sign the River Pact"
FBK.10.d:0 "An envoy arrived this morning, bring word from the Zebra nation that they have accepted our deal. In return for land, they will help us to defeat the River Ponies."
FBK.10.a:0 "They may look odd, but they will be useful nonetheless"
FBK.11.t:0 "The Zebras turn their noses down at us"
FBK.11.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Zebras have sent a messenger telling us that they have no interest in our pact to partition the River Federation."
FBK.11.a:0 "We should've known they were cowards"
FBK.13.t:0 "The Deer sign the River Pact"
FBK.13.d:0 "We received word from the South today that the Deer are willing and eager to support us in our war with the River Federation."
FBK.13.a:0 "The Federation's days are numbered!"
FBK.14.t:0 "The Deer ignore our proposal"
FBK.14.d:0 "Bad news arrived today - the Deer are not interested in joining with us against the River Ponies."
FBK.14.a:0 "Damn their eyes"
FBK.15.t:0 "Military Mission From Farbrook"
FBK.15.d:0 "In view of our new alliance with Hermane Gering, Farbrook has sent some of its finest military minds on a mission to our nation. This should significantly improve the quality of our officer corps."
FBK.15.a:0 "Maybe those northerners aren't so bad after all"
FBK.16.a:0 "The Coldmouth Corridor"
FBK.16.t:0 "Farbrook Demands Coldmouth Corridor"
FBK.16.d:0 "Hermane Gering's rhetoric has been getting more and more inflammatory as of late. He has been speaking for months about how the land from Coldmouth to the sea is, and always has been, hill pony land, and that all hill ponies should be in one nation. Now, an ultimatum has been delivered to us - cede this territory to Farbrook's regime or face open war."
FBK.16.a:0 "We have no choice. Surrender the land"
FBK.16.b:0 "Over my dead body!"
FBK.17.t:0 "Firtree Folds"
FBK.17.d:0 "Intimidated by our great might, Firtree has willingly ceded the Coldmouth Corridor."
FBK.17.a:0 "As it should be"
FBK.18.t:0 "Firtree Defiant"
FBK.18.d:0 "Foolishly, the ponies of Firtree have refused our generous offer to unite all hillponies under one nation."
FBK.18.a:0 "Do they think the Federation will protect them? Hah!"
FBK.19.t:0 "Famine Strikes!"
FBK.19.d:0 "Unfortunately, Moonblossom's policies of forced technological regression have had entirely predictable effects. Our food production is no longer able to keep up with our population, and food is rapidly running out. Babes are wailing in hunger, mothers have nothing to give them. Riots are breaking out all over the country, and all eyes turn to Moonblossom's tent, seeking a way out of this disaster."
FBK.19.a:0 "If only we had known!"
FBK.20.t:0 "Farbrook Begs For Food"
FBK.20.d:0 "A desperate envoy arrived this morning, famished and gaunt, like a skeleton. He told us that Farbrook's leader, Moonblossom, had enacted policies of agrarianism and primtivism that had resulted in a terrible famine that will surely kill thousands of ponies if nothing is done about it. Farbrook begs us to come in and take care of them - all government has collapsed entirely, rioting is commonplace, and the strongest steal and hoard what food remains for themselves. The situation is extremely dire, and only a complete takeover is likely to prove effective at this point."
FBK.20.a:0 "This is a humanitarian disaster! Taking over their land would be, not imperialism, but mercy"
FBK.20.b:0 "Sorry, but we simply cannot afford to take on this much responsibility"
FBK.21.t:0 "Upon Deaf Ears"
FBK.21.d:0 "Our offer has been rejected. [From.Owner.GetName] is not interested in taking care of us, and we can expect no help from them."
FBK.21.a:0 "Can we ever catch a break?"
FBK.hillwarriors.t:0 "The Farbrook Hill Warrior Corps"
FBK.hillwarriors.d:0 "Farbrook has today announced that they have established a corps of mountaineers, drawing upon the military experiences of their ancestors. As they are a Federation member, they have sent these soldiers to be part of our joint military, so that the whole Federation can benefit from their skill."
FBK.hillwarriors.a:0 "Excellent news!"
FBK.22.t:0 "Farbrook institutes Federation Day"
FBK.22.d:0 "Farbrook has officially inaugurated today as Federation Day - a national holiday celebrating the greatness of the River Federation and its members. This infectious celebration of civic nationalism has boosted morale slightly across the nation."
FBK.22.a:0 "If only our other States were more like them!"
FBK.23.t:0 "Farbrook secedes from the Federation"
FBK.23.d:0 "Disastrous news! The Regional Governor of Farbrook today declared his state independent of the Federation, claiming they were reclaiming their sovereignty from the 'overbearing hand' of River City. While proclaiming a desire for peaceful relations, he stated in no uncertain terms that Farbrook will decide her own future."
FBK.23.a:0 "Traitors! After all we've done for them! To war!"
FBK.23.b:0 "Lodge a diplomatic protest"
FBK.24.t:0 "The Time Has Come"
FBK.24.d:0 "Our allies are at war with The River Federation. As per our pact, we are now obliged to join them in this endeavour."
FBK.24.a:0 "To war!"
FBK.24.b:0 "On second thought..."
FBK.25.t:0 "[From.GetName] Honors The River Pact"
FBK.25.d:0 "[From.GetName] has honored our pact and is now at war with the River Federation."
FBK.25.a:0 "Excellent!"
FBK.26.t:0 "[From.GetName] dishonors The River Pact"
FBK.26.d:0 "[From.GetName] has dishonored the River Pact, and has declined to help us in our war against the River Federation."
FBK.26.a:0 "May the crows eat their eyes!"
FBK.27.t:0 "Reorganising The Taken Land"
FBK.27.d:0 "We have won our victory against the River Federation, and now the time has come to distribute land to our allies as we promised. We have taken temporary custodianship of the conquered territory as per the treaty."
FBK.27.a:0 "The spoils of war!"
FBK.28.t:0 "The Spoils Of War"
FBK.28.d:0 "These territorial demands were negotiated prior to the war, and were part of the River Pact."
FBK.28.a:0 "Our allies shall have what they deserve"
FBK.29.t:0 "Farbrook delegates desire the secret of gunpowder"
FBK.29.d:0 "The ponies of Farbrook are laughably primitive, still fighting primarily with spears and blades. They have heard of our guns, however, and now a group of their richest nobles have arrived in River City, asking to purchase the secrets to gunpowder technology. Most see this as harmless, as the Farbrookians are too few and disunited to be a threat. In addition, it would provide a slight bonus to the local economy."
FBK.29.a:0 "It'll be funny to see them marvel over our cast-off muskets and cannons!"
FBK.29.b:0 "I'm not too keen on giving the savages better weapons, even if they're friendly savages..."
FBK.30.t:0 "We Return With Firearms"
FBK.30.d:0 "Success! We have returned with weapons! Furthermore, we have learned much about the manufacture of guns and cannons - we now have access to these useful technologies!"
FBK.30.a:0 "Excellent!"
FBK.31.t:0 "Limited Success"
FBK.31.d:0 "Distressingly, the River ponies attempted to limit our ability to purchase guns from them, or to learn about them. Still, we made off with a fair few, and we have learned much about their manufacture regardless."
FBK.31.a:0 "Darn riverfolk...!"
FBK.32.t:0 "The Riverfolk assimilate"
FBK.32.d:0 "It seems that our policy of tolerance and forebearance has begun to bear fruit. Though they still fear and dislike us, some of the Riverponies have come to accept our dominance as simply the way of things, and are now focussing on trying to live their lives as best they can under our rule. Though it is small, this represents a real and substantive step toward establishing our full control over the Riverlands."
FBK.32.a:0 "Our Empire comes a step closer to stability"
FBK.33.t:0 "Farbrook Commune requests that we join N.E.S.U"
FBK.33.d:0 "The newly-installed Communist government of Farbrook has emerged from the turmoil of revolution and is now looking outwards to spread their revolution. They have come forward with a proposal that we join together in revolutionary fellowship, and join a socialist economic and military union of the Northeastern states."
FBK.33.a:0 "Of course, Comrades!"
FBK.33.b:0 "This sounds too reactionary for us"
FBK.34.t:0 "[From.GetName] joins N.E.S.U!"
FBK.34.d:0 "Excellent news, Comrade-Secretary! [From.GetName] has seen the value in socialist brotherhood, and has agreed to join N.E.S.U."
FBK.34.a:0 "Wonderful!"
FBK.35.t:0 "[From.GetName] rejects us"
FBK.35.d:0 "Dire news, Comrade! [From.GetName] has foolishly spurned our offer of socialist friendship and has refused to take part in N.E.S.U!"
FBK.35.a:0 "Revisionists! Class traitors! The workers must unite, or they will be enslaved again!"
FBK.35.b:0 "It would not be very socialist of us to force them to unite by violence"
