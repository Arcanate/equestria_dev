FIR_shinespark:0 "Shinespark Returns From Exile"
FIR_shinespark_desc:0 "The notorious rogue mage, Shinespark, has returned from exile in the North. Shinespark has spent the intervening time studying magic of the foulest and darkest kind, and has attracted a cadre of disciples devoted to her ideas of unicorn supremacy. Bloody rebellion is all but certain."
FIR_harmony_wins:0 "A Victory For Harmony"
FIR_harmony_wins_desc:0 "After a short but bitter war, Shinespark's forces have been routed, and she has been captured. The Grand Elder will soon decide her fate, but for now, peace returns to the land."
FIR_shinespark_wins:0 "A Victory For Shinespark"
FIR_shinespark_wins_desc:0 "The war was short, but bloody. Shinespark's loyalists overpowered the Elder's troops and have captured all village leadership. The fate of the people now lies in the capable hooves of Shinespark. All hail our great leader!"
FIR_shinespark_trial:0 "Shinespark's Trial"
FIR_shinespark_trial_desc:0 "Shinespark has been captured, and brought before the whole people of Firtree. In front of all, the Elder pronounces his judgment - that her sins are scarlet, and that the only recompense possible for such grave evil is death."
FIR_promote_harmony:0 "Promote Harmony"
FIR_promote_harmony_desc:0 "Shinespark's poisonous ideology has created a terrible rift in our society. By trying to turn unicorns and non-magic users against each other, she has inflicted deep wounds on our society. We must be better than she would have been. We must rebuild the harmony of our people, and heal this rift."
FIR_rebuild_villages:0 "Rebuild the Villages"
FIR_rebuild_villages_desc:0 "The fighting in the recent war has taken a brutal toll on the villages of Firtrees. Loyalist warriors and Golden-Horns alike raided and seized supplies from farmers, and engaged in brutal reprisals against those perceived to be helping the other side. We must undo this damage."
FIR_suppress_magic:0 "Clamp Down On Magic"
FIR_suppress_magic_desc:0 "Shinespark's actions have proven that magic is far too dangerous for ponies to be allowed to practice it freely. We must ban books on magic and strictly forbid unicorns to use it, except within very specific limits."
FIR_oaths:0 "The Oaths Of Loyalty"
FIR_oaths_desc:0 "Shinespark was able to gain substantial support even among non-unicorns, because the local chiefs were so independent, and possessed of such little loyalty to the people as a whole that they were willing to put their personal gain ahead of their people's. We must force the village leaders to take oaths of loyalty to the Grand Elder, in order to prevent another such revolt."
FIR_orphans_and_widows:0 "The Orphans and Widows of War"
FIR_orphans_and_widows_desc:0 "The war, though short, was very brutal, and many young stallions will never return to their families. We must provide for the widows and orphans made by the war, so that their sorrow may be less."
FIR_firtree_stands_tall:0 "Firtree Stands Tall"
FIR_firtree_stands_tall_desc:0 "At last, most of the wounds caused by the civil war have been healed. At last, Firtree can stand tall again, and begin to look outwards."
FIR_unicorn_paramilitaries:0 "Unicorn Paramilitaries"
FIR_unicorn_paramilitaries_desc:0 "The Grand Elder's forces may have surrendered, but Shinespark's power is not yet entirely secure. We cannot rely on the village chieftains and their warriors - we must establish a group of unicorn soldiers that are loyal to Shinespark, and to her alone, to ensure that her will is enforced."
FIR_magocracy:0 "Establish Magocratic System"
FIR_magocracy_desc:0 "It is obvious from the nature of things that those who wield magic are superior to those who do not. The idea of anyone other than magic users ruling society is laughably absurd - this is the doctrine of Shinespark, and we will restructure our society around it."
FIR_hunt_down_rebels:0 "Hunt Down Rebels"
FIR_hunt_down_rebels_desc:0 "Though the Grand Elder's forces have been defeated, many ponies resent our rule and struggle against us in secret, both violently and non-violently. We cannot allow such disobedience - the dissenters must be purged."
FIR_slave_soldiers:0 "Slave Soldiers"
FIR_slave_soldiers_desc:0 "While unicorns will always be the heart and soul of our forces, we realise that there simply are not enough of them to comprise our entire army. We must, begrudgingly, allow our slaves to serve as frontline warriors, to shield our real troops. Of course, we will only give them magically-created weapons, so that we can take them away at a moment's notice..."
FIR_caste_system:0 "Caste System"
FIR_caste_system_desc:0 "A necessary corollary of our belief in the superiority of mages is that society should be properly ordered to recognise this truth. We will establish a social caste system, with powerful unicorns at the top, followed by lesser unicorns, then loyal non-mages, then the untrustworthy at the bottom as slaves."
FIR_pro_unicorn_propaganda:0 "Pro-Unicorn Propaganda"
FIR_pro_unicorn_propaganda_desc:0 "It seems that some of our subjects still do not see the benefits of our magically-ordered society. We should properly distribute correct information to ensure that they come to understand the righteousness of our society."
FIR_magocracy_rises:0 "The Magocracy Rises"
FIR_magocracy_rises_desc:0 "At last, our rule has been solidified. Those who oppose us dare not do so openly, and the number of genuine Golden-Horns supporters grows day by day. At last, we can turn our eyes away from internal matters and deal with the outside world."
FIR_isolation:0 "Isolationist Policy"
FIR_isolation_desc:0 "We have decided that external influence can only be a bad thing for our country. We will close our borders, trying to keep out all corrupting presences."
FIR_looking_outwards:0 "Looking Outwards"
FIR_looking_outwards_desc:0 "We can no longer afford to ignore the world beyond our borders, however much we might want to. External forces are going to come looking for us, whether we look for them or not, and it's always better to be prepared than taken unawares."
FIR_harmony_isolation:0 "A Strong and Gentle Hand"
FIR_harmony_isolation_desc:0 "The Grand Elder's protection is the only reason why we survived Shinespark's attack. Why would we ever wish to elect anyone else? Should we throw away our propserity, dispose ourselves of our protector? We should crown the Grand Elder as King of Firtrees, to rule and protect forevermore!"
FIR_fascist_isolation:0 "Perfect Our Magic"
FIR_fascist_isolation_desc:0 "Shinespark is not interested in war and conquest - all she cares about is power, and the study of magic. We should isolate ourselves behind magical barriers, so that we can perfect our society and advance our study of the magical arts."
FIR_harmony_outwards:0 "Dealing with our Neighbours"
FIR_harmony_outwards_desc:0 "Our neighbours, the villages of Farbrook and Watertowns, should be our first port of call. We must ensure that they are not a threat to us, one way or the other."
FIR_fascist_outwards:0 "We Need More Slaves"
FIR_fascist_outwards_desc:0 "Shinespark wants more power, and more power means more magic, and more magic means more energy, and more energy means more slaves. We must crush the nearby villages, and take what is theirs!"
FIR_farbrook_friends:0 "Befriend Farbrook"
FIR_farbrook_friends_desc:0 "The hillponies of Farbrook have always been good to us. We should reach out to them, to establish more formal relations, helping to mutually ensure the safety of both our peoples."
FIR_crush_farbrook:0 "End the Threat From Farbrook"
FIR_crush_farbrook_desc:0 "Farbrook and Firtree have had a generally good relationship over the years, but it has soured remarkably in the last few years. A new, radical government has taken power, and gazes upon our lands with greedy eyes. We must strike them first, to protect our freedom."
FIR_watertown_friends:0 "Peace With The Commune"
FIR_watertown_friends_desc:0 "The northeren ponies of Watertowns have always been friendly and peaceful. There is no need for there to be violence or mistrust between us. Let's be friends!"
FIR_crush_watertown:0 "The Commune Cannot Be Trusted"
FIR_crush_watertown_desc:0 "The ponies of Watertown have traditionally been peaceful, but that has changed in recent years. A more bellicose, aggressive leader has taken charge, and poses a clear threat to our safety. This cannot be allowed to stand - the Commune must be brought to order."

### EVENTS #################################
###########################################
FIR.1.t:0 "Shinespark's Return"
FIR.1.d:0 "The notorious mage, Shinespark, was exiled from Firtree for advocating that magic-users should rule over non-magical ponies. Though we thought she would surely perish in the North, she did not, and has learned many foul magics. She has gathered a cadre of like-minded followers, and has returned to her ancestral home in order to seize power. Blood and strife have descended upon Firtree, as they have not done in an age."
FIR.1.a:0 "The Great Elder will save us from this madness!"
FIR.1.b:0 "Unicorns are the superior race!"
FBK.2.t:0 "Power Struggles within the Council"
FBK.2.d:0 "The Council has rejected the experienced leadership of Cenhelm - but who will they choose to replace him?"
FBK.2.a:0 "The Communists have some interesting ideas - let's invite them into the Council"
FBK.2.b:0 "Chief Gering shows promise - he will lead us through this difficult time"
FBK.3.t:0 "A Proposal From The East"
FBK.3.d:0 "An pony envoy sought an audience with the Regent today, and offered a most interesting proposal. She claimed to come from the far east, from a backwards nation called Farbrook. We recognised the name as one of the clans of savages that the Knightly Orders have been charged with guarding our Eastern border from for centuries now. The envoy claimed that Farbrook regrets their history of animosity with us, and claims her leader, Hermane Gering, asks for help. Gering wishes to unite the Ponies of the Eastern Hills and plains, but the River Federation is posing a major obstacle to this, and he asks for our aid in defeating them. In exchange, Gering offers his obedience to the crown, offering the Eastern lands to us if we will but allow him to administrate them."
FBK.3.a:0 "Offer him weapons and technical assistants. We have much to gain and little to lose"
FBK.3.b:0 "We are not interested in the affairs of savages"
FBK.4.t:0 "Divide and Conquer"
FBK.4.d:0 "A messenger came from the frigid North today. He claimed to speak on behalf of Hermane Gering, Chieftain of the hillponies of Farbrook. Chieftain Gering is offering us a simple deal: agree to go to war with the Federation alongside Gering, and we will be granted a large chunk of the spoils, gaining access to the rich floodplains and FBKmlands of the River Valleys. What will our response be?"
FBK.4.a:0 "The lands are fertile...tell him we accept"
FBK.4.b:0 "This isn't in our best interest"
FBK.5.t:0 "Divide and Conquer"
FBK.5.d:0 "A messenger came from the frigid North today. He claimed to speak on behalf of Hermane Gering, Chieftain of the hillponies of Farbrook. Chieftain Gering is offering us a simple deal: agree to go to war with the Federation alongside Gering, and we will be granted a large chunk of the spoils, gaining access to the rich floodplains and FBKmlands of the River Valleys. What will our response be?"
FBK.5.a:0 "The lands are fertile...tell him we accept"
FBK.5.b:0 "This isn't in our best interest"
FBK.6.t:0 "The Empire is Interested"
FBK.6.d:0 "Our messenger arrived from Griffonheim yesterday, with excellent news - the Empire has accepted our offer. Military advisors, weapons, and personnel will be delivered to us for the war effort, though the Empire is not willing to commit itself personally to a war in the East. Of course, they DO expect our pledge of alleigance in exchange..."
FBK.6.a:0 "Of course, of course, whatever they want"
FBK.7.t:0 "Imperial Scorn"
FBK.7.d:0 "Ill news has returned to us this day: the Empire is not interested in helping us against the Federation. They are unwilling to commit themselves to a war in the East without better hope of a profit for themselves."
FBK.7.a:0 "We will have to look elsewhere"
FBK.8.t:0 "The Gryphian Host signs the River Pact"
FBK.8.d:0 "Excellent news! The Gryphian Host has agreed to our terms, and will attack the Federation alongside us. However, they will demand part of the Federation's land in exchange for this."
FBK.8.a:0 "I can already hear Lake City burning!"
FBK.9.t:0 "The Gryphian Host isn't interested"
FBK.9.d:0 "Sad news came from the South today - the Gryphian Host refused to join our offensive pact to partition the River Federation."
FBK.9.a:0 "Never trust a Griffon!"
FBK.10.t:0 "The Zebras sign the River Pact"
FBK.10.d:0 "An envoy arrived this morning, bring word from the Zebra nation that they have accepted our deal. In return for land, they will help us to defeat the River Ponies."
FBK.10.a:0 "They may look odd, but they will be useful nonetheless"
FBK.11.t:0 "The Zebras turn their noses down at us"
FBK.11.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Zebras have sent a messenger telling us that they have no interest in our pact to partition the River Federation."
FBK.11.a:0 "We should've known they were cowards"
FBK.13.t:0 "The Deer sign the River Pact"
FBK.13.d:0 "We received word from the South today that the Deer are willing and eager to support us in our war with the River Federation."
FBK.13.a:0 "The Federation's days are numbered!"
FBK.14.t:0 "The Deer ignore our proposal"
FBK.14.d:0 "Bad news arrived today - the Deer are not interested in joining with us against the River Ponies."
FBK.14.a:0 "Damn their eyes"
FBK.15.t:0 "Military Mission From Farbrook"
FBK.15.d:0 "In view of our new alliance with Hermane Gering, Farbrook has sent some of its finest military minds on a mission to our nation. This should significantly improve the quality of our officer corps."
FBK.15.a:0 "Maybe those northerners aren't so bad after all"
FBK.16.a:0 "The Coldmouth Corridor"
FBK.16.t:0 "Farbrook Demands Coldmouth Corridor"
FBK.16.d:0 "Hermane Gering's rhetoric has been getting more and more inflammatory as of late. He has been speaking for months about how the land from Coldmouth to the sea is, and always has been, hill pony land, and that all hill ponies should be in one nation. Now, an ultimatum has been delivered to us - cede this territory to Farbrook's regime or face open war."
FBK.16.a:0 "We have no choice. Surrender the land"
FBK.16.b:0 "Over my dead body!"
FBK.17.t:0 "Firtree Folds"
FBK.17.d:0 "Intimidated by our great might, Firtree has willingly ceded the Coldmouth Corridor."
FBK.17.a:0 "As it should be"
FBK.18.t:0 "Firtree Defiant"
FBK.18.d:0 "Foolishly, the ponies of Firtree have refused our generous offer to unite all hillponies under one nation."
FBK.18.a:0 "Do they think the Federation will protect them? Hah!"
FBK.19.t:0 "Famine Strikes!"
FBK.19.d:0 "Unfortunately, Moonblossom's policies of forced technological regression have had entirely predictable effects. Our food production is no longer able to keep up with our population, and food is rapidly running out. Babes are wailing in hunger, mothers have nothing to give them. Riots are breaking out all over the country, and all eyes turn to Moonblossom's tent, seeking a way out of this disaster."
FBK.19.a:0 "If only we had known!"
FBK.20.t:0 "Farbrook Begs For Food"
FBK.20.d:0 "A desperate envoy arrived this morning, famished and gaunt, like a skeleton. He told us that Farbrook's leader, Moonblossom, had enacted policies of agrarianism and primtivism that had resulted in a terrible famine that will surely kill thousands of ponies if nothing is done about it. Farbrook begs us to come in and take care of them - all government has collapsed entirely, rioting is commonplace, and the strongest steal and hoard what food remains for themselves. The situation is extremely dire, and only a complete takeover is likely to prove effective at this point."
FBK.20.a:0 "This is a humanitarian disaster! Taking over their land would be, not imperialism, but mercy"
FBK.20.b:0 "Sorry, but we simply cannot afford to take on this much responsibility"
FBK.21.t:0 "Upon Deaf Ears"
FBK.21.d:0 "Our offer has been rejected. [From.Owner.GetName] is not interested in taking care of us, and we can expect no help from them."
FBK.21.a:0 "Can we ever catch a break?"
FBK.hillwarriors.t:0 "The Farbrook Hill Warrior Corps"
FBK.hillwarriors.d:0 "Farbrook has today announced that they have established a corps of mountaineers, drawing upon the military experiences of their ancestors. As they are a Federation member, they have sent these soldiers to be part of our joint military, so that the whole Federation can benefit from their skill."
FBK.hillwarriors.a:0 "Excellent news!"
FBK.22.t:0 "Farbrook institutes Federation Day"
FBK.22.d:0 "Farbrook has officially inaugurated today as Federation Day - a national holiday celebrating the greatness of the River Federation and its members. This infectious celebration of civic nationalism has boosted morale slightly across the nation."
FBK.22.a:0 "If only our other States were more like them!"
FBK.23.t:0 "Farbrook secedes from the Federation"
FBK.23.d:0 "Disastrous news! The Regional Governor of Farbrook today declared his state independent of the Federation, claiming they were reclaiming their sovereignty from the 'overbearing hand' of River City. While proclaiming a desire for peaceful relations, he stated in no uncertain terms that Farbrook will decide her own future."
FBK.23.a:0 "Traitors! After all we've done for them! To war!"
FBK.23.b:0 "Lodge a diplomatic protest"
FBK.24.t:0 "The Time Has Come"
FBK.24.d:0 "Our allies are at war with The River Federation. As per our pact, we are now obliged to join them in this endeavour."
FBK.24.a:0 "To war!"
FBK.24.b:0 "On second thought..."
FBK.25.t:0 "[From.GetName] Honors The River Pact"
FBK.25.d:0 "[From.GetName] has honored our pact and is now at war with the River Federation."
FBK.25.a:0 "Excellent!"
FBK.26.t:0 "[From.GetName] dishonors The River Pact"
FBK.26.d:0 "[From.GetName] has dishonored the River Pact, and has declined to help us in our war against the River Federation."
FBK.26.a:0 "May the crows eat their eyes!"
FBK.27.t:0 "Reorganising The Taken Land"
FBK.27.d:0 "We have won our victory against the River Federation, and now the time has come to distribute land to our allies as we promised. We have taken temporary custodianship of the conquered territory as per the treaty."
FBK.27.a:0 "The spoils of war!"
FBK.28.t:0 "The Spoils Of War"
FBK.28.d:0 "These territorial demands were negotiated prior to the war, and were part of the River Pact."
FBK.28.a:0 "Our allies shall have what they deserve"
FBK.29.t:0 "Farbrook delegates desire the secret of gunpowder"
FBK.29.d:0 "The ponies of Farbrook are laughably primitive, still fighting primarily with spears and blades. They have heard of our guns, however, and now a group of their richest nobles have arrived in River City, asking to purchase the secrets to gunpowder technology. Most see this as harmless, as the Farbrookians are too few and disunited to be a threat. In addition, it would provide a slight bonus to the local economy."
FBK.29.a:0 "It'll be funny to see them marvel over our cast-off muskets and cannons!"
FBK.29.b:0 "I'm not too keen on giving the savages better weapons, even if they're friendly savages..."
FBK.30.t:0 "We Return With Firearms"
FBK.30.d:0 "Success! We have returned with weapons! Furthermore, we have learned much about the manufacture of guns and cannons - we now have access to these useful technologies!"
FBK.30.a:0 "Excellent!"
FBK.31.t:0 "Limited Success"
FBK.31.d:0 "Distressingly, the River ponies attempted to limit our ability to purchase guns from them, or to learn about them. Still, we made off with a fair few, and we have learned much about their manufacture regardless."
FBK.31.a:0 "Darn riverfolk...!"
FBK.32.t:0 "The Riverfolk assimilate"
FBK.32.d:0 "It seems that our policy of tolerance and forebearance has begun to bear fruit. Though they still fear and dislike us, some of the Riverponies have come to accept our dominance as simply the way of things, and are now focussing on trying to live their lives as best they can under our rule. Though it is small, this represents a real and substantive step toward establishing our full control over the Riverlands."
FBK.32.a:0 "Our Empire comes a step closer to stability"
FBK.33.t:0 "Farbrook Commune requests that we join N.E.S.U"
FBK.33.d:0 "The newly-installed Communist government of Farbrook has emerged from the turmoil of revolution and is now looking outwards to spread their revolution. They have come forward with a proposal that we join together in revolutionary fellowship, and join a socialist economic and military union of the Northeastern states."
FBK.33.a:0 "Of course, Comrades!"
FBK.33.b:0 "This sounds too reactionary for us"
FBK.34.t:0 "[From.GetName] joins N.E.S.U!"
FBK.34.d:0 "Excellent news, Comrade-Secretary! [From.GetName] has seen the value in socialist brotherhood, and has agreed to join N.E.S.U."
FBK.34.a:0 "Wonderful!"
FBK.35.t:0 "[From.GetName] rejects us"
FBK.35.d:0 "Dire news, Comrade! [From.GetName] has foolishly spurned our offer of socialist friendship and has refused to take part in N.E.S.U!"
FBK.35.a:0 "Revisionists! Class traitors! The workers must unite, or they will be enslaved again!"
FBK.35.b:0 "It would not be very socialist of us to force them to unite by violence"
