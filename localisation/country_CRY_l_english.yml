CRY_bunker_building_desc:0 "In order to delay the enemy advance deeper into our territory and to stress his logistics, the order has been given to construct fortifications across our nation in strategic positions. We will force any invader to lose momentum and trade more casualties for every piece of land taken from us while we safely retreat from bunker to bunker to make the invader's life as awful as possible. Additionally, our units will be able to reorganize and conduct counterattacks easier due to frontline depots on the weaker, more spread out enemy forces.\n\nThe lands of our Crystal Empire are vast and empty. We can give part of them to the enemy and see how long he can survive in its harsh conditions."
