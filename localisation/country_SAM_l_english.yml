SAM_iron_regency:0 "The Iron Regency"
SAM_iron_regency_desc:0 "Herra Manfred Vanistö, regent of Sambar, took power following the events of 1005, but has refused to coronate a new Yaril ever since. The sheer brutality of Vanistö in his quest to eradicate native rebellion has led him to be known as the "Iron Regent" - a hero among the Olenian settlers that saw their towns ravaged by the Summer Revolution and a fierce warrior of Ukko. The natives, of course, have a different idea, and even much of the nobility has begun to disagree with the methods of Vanistö in his quest to return Sambar to the old way.\n\nOne thing is clear, however - Vanistö must choose a new Yaril for Sambar soon."
SAM_shattered_yarildom:0 "Legacy of '05"
SAM_shattered_yarildom_desc:0 "Native princes, Doehlian insurgents, and Macawian-backed democrats revolted against the Sambari government in a harrowing event known as the "Summer Revolution", where the Yaril was murdered and the government of Sambar itself was briefly replaced by a native council. Pledging to institute a princely federation in the style of Doehli before a further government could be chosen, the native council recieved broad support from Sambar's Hindian class, who still grieve its loss. Although with the help of the navy, our glorious leader Herra Manfred Vanistö eventually brought an end to the rebellion, the damage was already done. The direct patrilineal line of the Yarils of Sambar was extinguished, and Vanistö found himself ruling a city of ashes and a country torn aoart by the effects of the revolution.\n\nThe natives have not forgotten the crackdowns of Vanistö nor the glories of their first revolution, and are determined to set Sambar right once more - whatever the cost." 
SAM_jewel_of_sambar:0 "The Jewel of the Sambari"
SAM_jewel_of_sambar_desc:0 "Sambar's great navy, affectionally titled "Samambarhee Ka Gahana", or "the Jewel of the Sambari", has never been defeated by rival vikings, Macawian pirates, nor foreign peacekeeping forces. The fact that Sambar has faced so many revolts, harsh summers, and failed industrialization policies makes its navy a symbol of stability and order in a chaotic landscape. However, not all is well within the ranks of the navy - its bloated budget has seen Sambari suffer to conserve their jewelk, and the commanders themselves have shown displeasure for the violent, hostile actions of Regent Vanistö and his zealous reliance on the admirality to do his dirty work.\n\nAs long as Herra Manfred has the navy on his side, there is little chance any petty revolt could stop him - but if the admirals ever had an interest in ending the regency, there would be nothing to stop them."
