NLR_moonshine_weaponstealers_3:0 "Hidden Supply Depots"
NLR_moonshine_weaponstealers_3_desc:0 "Thanks to Luna's Royal codes, we were able to make repeated daring raids on Equestrian supplies, even as they fruitlessless tried to stop us. Much of Equestria's military supplies are now hidden in a network of depots across the nation."
NLR_moonshine_weaponstealers_2:0 "Hidden Weapons Caches"
NLR_moonshine_weaponstealers_2_desc:0 "We made several daring raids to steal Equestrian equipment, followed by raids on older, less guarded equipment. As a result our troops are supported by a hidden network of weapons caches."
NLR_moonshine_weaponstealers_1:0 "Minor Hidden Weapons Caches"
NLR_moonshine_weaponstealers_1_desc:0 "We initially made several daring raids to steal Equestrian equipment, but quickly moved to more cautious methods. As a result we have small but helpful collection of supply caches to assist in supporting our troops."
NLR_moonshine_weaponstealers_0:0 "Stolen Weapons Stolen"
NLR_moonshine_weaponstealers_0_desc:0 "With the discovery of Nightmare Moon's plot, the Equestrian army moved quickly to recover many missing weapons shipments. Our stolen weapons have been stolen, and we are now attempting to execute battleplans that expected supplies we do not have."
NLR_moonshine_workers_3:0 "Hardworking Workers"
NLR_moonshine_workers_3_desc:0 "Luna's hard work in campaigning for civil rights established a strong grassroots presence among the workers on the east coast. Production is good and many strongly believe our official narrative about the war, hoping to help "Luna" save Celestia by banishing "Daybreaker"."
NLR_moonshine_workers_2:0 "Supportive Workers"
NLR_moonshine_workers_2_desc:0 "Luna's work in campaigning for civil rights established a grassroots presence among the workers on the east coast. Production is above average and most accept our official narrative about the war, hoping to help "Luna" save Celestia by banishing "Daybreaker"."
NLR_moonshine_workers_1:0 "Confused Workers"
NLR_moonshine_workers_1_desc:0 "Although Luna campaigned effectively on the east coast generating strong support, her weak minded focus on Friendship and kindness left many workers confused and unsure how this war reflects those values. Fortunately "Luna"'s true identity remains only a whispered rumour and production continues mostly unchanged. "
NLR_moonshine_workers_0:0 "Disloyal Workers"
NLR_moonshine_workers_0_desc:0 "With the prior discovery of Nightmare Moon's plot, some workers openly discuss their suspicions of "Luna"'s true identity and question the claims of Celestia's evil. Production is suffering."
NLR_moonshine_bats_3:0 "Full Thestral Readiness"
NLR_moonshine_bats_3_desc:0 "The thestral forces were fully committed to a possible military conflict and are contributing well to the civil war."
NLR_moonshine_bats_2:0 "Partial Thestral Readiness"
NLR_moonshine_bats_2_desc:0 "The thestral forces were partially mobilised when war broke out. They are contributing to the civil war."
NLR_moonshine_bats_1:0 "Unprepared Thestral Forces"
NLR_moonshine_bats_1_desc:0 "Thestral planning for any conflict was mostly limited to defensive and isolationist plans. The national nature of the civil war has taken them off guard and their contibution to the war effort is lacking."
NLR_moonshine_bats_0:0 "Isolated Thestral Forces"
NLR_moonshine_bats_0_desc:0 "With the discovery of Nightmare Moon's plot, Equestrian forces moved to prepare for any conflict with the batpony mountain holds, leaving us at a disadvantage. Our communication with them is poor and they are suffering defections. "

lunas.2.t:0 "Rebels in the South"
lunas.2.d:0 "We're losing control over our southern regions, different groups are taking up arms to violently protect their ideals."
lunas.2.a:0 "Can we do something?"

lunas.3.t:0 "Tall Tale counter-revolt"
lunas.3.d:0 "We've lost control over Tall Tale and its surrounding territories - the loyalist traitors took city in their hooves."
lunas.3.a:0 "We will not forget."

lunas.5.t:0 "The War is coming to an end"
lunas.5.d:0 "With help of Nightmare Moon's faithful subjects, we've defeated so called Celestial State in the south. The organisation of Disciples of the Night has served its purpose."
lunas.5.a:0 "Truly."

lunas.6.t:0 "The South-East Intervention"
lunas.6.d:0 "Our garrison in south-eastern Equestria has been struggling for a long time now, with communist rebels rising up in Baltimare, natives rallying behind Doctor Caballeron and Celestial loyalists driving our forces out of Stableside. But so far Stars Whirl and her subordinates have performed admirably, holding the line long enough for us to defeat Celestia's primary forces. Now we can finally come to their aid and restore peace and order in the burning jungles."
lunas.6.a:0 "Onwards to victory!"

lunas.7.t:0 "An Exile From The Lunar Empire"
lunas.7.d:0 "Rumours have spread that the Lunar Empire is currently holding trials for captured generals from the opposing side. Princess Celestia's loyalists seem to receive little mercy and are either imprisoned or exiled. One such banished pony has now arrived in our country, offering us his services as an officer in the army. He swears loyalty to us and seems trustworthy enough."
lunas.7.a:0 "He can be useful to us."

lunas.9.t:0 "Lunar Volunteers"
lunas.9.d:0 "On a field used for playing buckball in peacetime, a large crowd had gathered, huddled together in the cold evening rain. Most of them were thestrals, but among them were earth ponies, pegasi and unicorns. All of them had a weapon of some sort; a rifle, a pistol, or something crude like a musket or even a pitchfork. The chatter among them stopped when a bat pony officer appeared and shouted "Attention!"\n\nOut of all the ponies on the field, he was the only one wearing a shiny new uniform. His duty was now that of an officer, and he would organize this rabble into a proper fighting unit.\n\n"Disciples of the Night! I am Lieutenant Silent Peaks. You have all come here to fight for equality between the four tribes, for the emancipation of the thestral race, and for the defence of our families against reprisals from Celestial loyalists. And it is a noble cause indeed, but a noble cause is not enough to make you good fighters. This is why you will be drilled, and I will turn you donkeys into a battalion worthy of our Empress. Discipline is needed if we wish to be victorious in this war, and discipline requires harshness. Think twice if you are ready for it, and for the horrors of battle. If not, then stop wasting my time and get out of my sight. The rest of you, step forth. We have prepared proper equipment for you, and lodgings for rest. Tomorrow the training will start. My task is to prepare you for the frontline as quickly as possible. It won't be easy for any of us, but by the end of it, you will resemble soldiers instead of angry peasants. Speaking of which, drop those damn pitchforks and come get actual weapons, you maggots!""
lunas.9.a:0 "Perhaps their skill will match their eagerness."

lunas.10.t:0 "Mission Briefing"
lunas.10.d:0 "Misty Night entered Lieutenant Silent Peak's tent and stood at attention. He was sitting behind her desk, reading reports on military operations in the sector. Next to the papers was a framed drawing of his daughter. Five minutes Misty Night stood, waiting patiently, until he finished reading and lifted his gaze. "Good, you didn't interrupt me. Now I am even more convinced you are the pony for the task."\n\nMisty Night nodded. "What is your command?"\n\n"I read from your background that you received training from fellow Disciples before taking part in several arms thefts as well as ambushes against Celestial loyalists before you volunteered to join the Lunar Army. I think you will be capable of fulfilling this task. The Empress has requested me to prepare ponies to escort a shipment of weapons to our fellow soldiers fighting against insurgents in the south-east. You will lead them and ensure you are not discovered by our enemies. Do you understand?"\n\n"Yes, sir."\n\n"Good. This mission is critical. Failure will be punished. Do not forget this."\n\n"I will not, sir. I would prefer death over failing my Goddess."\n\n"Death may well be your punishment. Now go and get your equipment. You will be leaving in an hour. The shipment is ready."\n\nShe bowed deeply, turned around and left. Silent glanced at the drawing on his desk.\n\n"I hope I can see her again soon," he mumbled quietly."

It is a choice between Canterlot, the capital of Equestria where Lunar symbols and monuments to civil war heroes are already replacing statues of Celestia; Manehattan, the hub of Luna's reform efforts and the most loyal supporter during the civil war; or the Castle of the Two Sisters, the ancient home of the monarchy where Luna and Celestia once lived together, and where our Empress fatefully turned into Nightmare Moon and tried to usurp her sister."
lunas.11.a:0 "Canterlot."
lunas.11.b:0 "Manehattan."
lunas.11.c:0 "Castle of the Two Sisters."

lunas.12.t:0 "The Fate Of [CRY.GetNameDef]"
lunas.12.d:0 "Beyond the northern border of the Lunar Empire lies another Empire of the crystal ponies. While they did not actively oppose us during the civil war, it is questionable if we can truly trust [CRY.GetLeader]. They might harbour sympathies for Celestia and her followers and could be plotting against us at this very moment. [CRY.GetNameDef] has barely any thestrals living in it, so why would they care for their plight?\n\nSomething must be done to ensure the safety of the northern frontier. The Empress' advisors have proposed two actions, one of which must be chosen. Either a swift military offensive needs to bring the crystal ponies under direct Imperial rule, or more peacefully, an envoy will be sent, asking them to become our loyal subjects. Of course, [CRY.GetLeader] might not be happy to bend the knee, but it is not like they have a choice. The Empress, however, does, and now she must decide before it is too late."
lunas.12.a:0 "Crush them swiftly."
lunas.12.b:0 "We shall demand their subservience!"
lunas.12.c:0 "Perhaps I should ask a friend for help..."

lunas.13.t:0 "The End of Civil War"
lunas.13.d:0 "[GetMonth], [GetYear]. The war is over and we are victorious. The last holdouts of the Equestrian Army have capitulated and Celestia herself has been captured. While pockets of resistance remain, they are scattered and disorganized. Our Empress is now preparing a ceremony in Canterlot where she will officially succeed her sister as the sole monarch Equestria, now known as the Lunar Empire. The time has come to rebuild and mend our wounds before our enemies take advantage of our weakness and war exhaustion."

It was very succinct, and its main demand was clear: Bend the knee or be destroyed.\n\nThe Empress wishes to eventually send a governor to ensure our everlasting loyalty to her, which would most likely endanger our sovereignty. However, if we refuse, we will be considered traitors who will receive swift justice from the Lunar Army. [CRY.GetLeader] should consider their response carefully, for the fate of our nation hangs by a very thin thread."

"Ah, yes, some biscuits, please."\nThe unicorn scoffed at her response and rolled her eyes. "You know precisely what I mean."\nNightmare Moon levitated the cup and blew into the steaming liquid. Rarity glared at her. Slowly, the cup rose, and the Empress sipped.\n"Mm, delicious. Now where are those biscuits?"\n"Uuugh, fine, you can have your accursed confection." She turned around to get a box of sweets.\n"Thank you. And yes, I need you for a very special task, Rarity. One that I can entrust on nopony else."\nShe sighed and gave the box to the Empress. "Goodness gracious, finally. Did you really need both tea and biscuits before you could tell me that?"\n"Why, yes. Manners, Rarity. We shouldn't rush into chatting before properly starting our teatime." She smirked smugly.\n"Oh yes. Of course. How very rude of me," Rarity mumbled in a monotone voice. "Now if you may excuse me for so impolitely inquiring directly, what task do you need me for?" she asked in an exaggeratedly mannered voice.\n"I need you visit [CRY.GetLeader], ask them to become our subjects, and to eventually govern the Crystal Empire in my name. That's all."\nRarity blinked twice, then fainted.\n"I'll take that as a yes," the Empress said and sipped some more tea."

While some voice displeasure at the possibility of aligning ourselves with such an upstart there are others who see promise in the repeatedly resurrected monarch.

Sombra laid out his feelings for all to see, and spoke very highly of Nightmare Moon and her nation. It seems that he wants to marry her, and in so doing create an alliance to shake the world. However, some aides remind Her Majesty of the rumors that Sombra once courted Celestia, and they ask if she really wants to risk ending up with her sister's leftovers."

However, changing its name back to how it was before the Winter Revolution is also out of the question. Princessyn makes ponies think of Celestia, and there are no princesses in Equestria anyways, only an Empress. The populace of the city will not react to the name change happily as they cling on to their foolish revolutionary ideas. Perhaps it would be best to punish them by demolishing the city entirely and deporting its population to the surrounding countryside. While extreme, this would effectively quell any thoughts of resistance.\n\nWhat shall the fate of the city be, your majesty?"

Regarded as a center of the modern arts before the war, the Lunar Government is doing its best to help the theatrical arts reclaim their title. Today across the Empire, one of the major studios, Warner Colts Pictures, put out a large scale advertisement campaign, looking to hire new actors, writers, and film staff, in preparation for a grand re-opening next year. Already, one of the studio's directors, Moon Flower, has announced a film she plans on creating, based on exploits of a heroic squad of bat ponies and Manehattan idealists during the civil war, who began at each other's throats, but by war's end were one of the finest teams of soldiers serving the Empire. "I plan on staying as faithful as possible to the original source material," Flower went on record to say, "so I have been in constant and frequent contact with the surviving members of the squad. All in all, I cannot wait to see this dream become reality, and for a new era of film to be a part of our corner of the world moving forward.""

While they had aided her treacherous older sibling during the war, perhaps they could yet be redeemed. The companies they owned employed many talented workers and owned many facilities, after all, which could benefit the Lunar Empire greatly.\n\nOf course, on the other hoof the companies could simply be dissolved and their assets confiscated, and the industrialists themselves thrown into the deepest dungeons, but without the skill and experience of the concerns their facilities couldn't be utilized to their full potential.\n\nWhat is the Empress' decision?"

We are no longer rag-tag groups of supporters fighting with guerilla tactics, we must be a single united force. On the recommendation of our advisors from Chiropterra, we shall call a conclave of our most experienced commanders to appoint a Warmaster for the Army. This Warmaster will be in charge of determining our nation's doctrine and craft our warfare style to their will. So as the conclave drags on, four plans have come out on top.\n\nFirst is Marshal Speck. Speck has received the most conventional military training out of the four candidates and favors warfare similar to the fledgling Equestrian army, with planning and logistics being essential for its conduct.\n\nSecond is Selenite. An extremely young officer, but fanatically loyal, Selenite has stated that the lives of the lunar faithful are too valuable for the war tactics of old to be used. She suggests to take full advantage of the new wonders of modern weaponry and refine it into a storm of iron and gunpowder. She argues her strategies save lives and are more effective in the modern era.\n\nThird is General Tempest Wind. Much like Selenite, Wind's doctrine is rooted in the reality of modern war, but approaches it from a different direction. Tempest says that the weapon that shall win the wars of the second millennium is the tank. After studying both the Stalliongradian and Changeling militaries, she has stated that their heresy aside, their ideas on war are worth adopting as our own.\n\nLast comes Midnight Oil. He bluntly declares that the Empire has two resources that it can use to emerge victoriously. It's large supply of ponypower, and its near unrivaled industrial capacity. He has combined this with his own theories about the nature of warfare regarding large front operations. Some call his doctrines barbaric, he calls them effective."

Once Luna returned she joined her "guard", a militia of batponies that wanted to protect her.\n\nNow in the times of war and chaos Bipen can prove her worth to her princess by fighting the enemies of the Night. She also dreams of a bright future after the war where thestrals will be finally treated as equals with the Three Tribes.§!"

Once Luna returned she joined her "guard", a militia of batponies that wanted to protect her.\n\nShe eagerly joined Luna's civil rights movement and participated in her campaigning. For all her efforts, she was rewarded with a high-ranking position in the Night Guard. Now, she is the Princess' most loyal guardian.§!"
NLR_selenite_desc:0 "Selenite was born on the 21st of December 980 ALB and was raised in a small town in the mountains of central Equestria. Despite excelling at most of the academic subjects at school she lived a fairly mundane foalhood, but once Luna returned she immediately moved to Canterlot and sought to serve her princess.\n\nBy the start of the year 1007 ALB, she's a leading armour officer in Equestria's first tank divisions. Whatever comes next for Equestria, Selenite will be sure to put her all towards loyally serving the Princess of the Night as well as fighting for an Equestria where all pony tribes live as equals.\n\nPortrait by Scroup"
