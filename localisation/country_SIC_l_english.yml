 SIC_urgent_parish_meeting:0 "The 1st 1007 Conclave of the Parishes"
 SIC_urgent_parish_meeting_desc:0 "Fears and tension caused by the chaos across the Griffonian continent over the last 40 years have finally come to a head in Sicameon. The two houses of our legislature, the Tribunal Urbes and the Parratoria, have come together to grant our previously highly decentralized national government more power than it has ever wielded before. How should we proceed?"
 SIC_midoria_plan:0 "The Midoria Plan"
 SIC_midoria_plan_desc:0 "Named for the greater level centralization it entails, its' favor with the city tribunes and spearheaded by the Tribune of Midoria Remige Plumar, this plan proposes a radical empowerment of our central government as desired by the PIS-R. While it would shake our national tradition of placing personal liberty above all else, the radicals insist that we must vest this power to have a hope of maintaining at all."
 SIC_epios_plan:0 "The Leve Plan"
 SIC_epios_plan_desc:0 "Named for the conservative approach to centralization favored by the moderate PIS-M and the majority of the parroquias, this plan proposes a more graduated approach to empowering our central government, to prevent potential abuses of power. The overall weakness of the government as prescribed in the Carta Federal is to balance the power between the parishes and capitol, this balance can be maintained."
 SIC_aggressive_foreign_policy:0 "Pursuing Aggressive Foreign Policy"
 SIC_aggressive_foreign_policy_desc:0 "An aggressive, proactive foreign policy is vital to the Midoria Plan. Long have we sat back and been a responsive force rather than taking initiative in our foreign affairs."
 SIC_sweeping_power:0 "Sweeping Executive Power"
 SIC_sweeping_power_desc:0 "A strong central government in Midoria is both vital and viable in this coming age. With telegraph and telephone wires and radio, we no longer are forced to rely on deferring to the Parishes for many issues, and thus we can direct the nation much more efficiently."
 SIC_checks_balances:0 "Checks and Balances"
 SIC_checks_balances_desc:0 "By creating a complex system of where the legislature, the dux, and the federal courts can counteract each other if one steps out of line, we can ensure that no one part of our national government will be able to seize all power, while unanimously beneficial decisions will always pass through."
 SIC_defensive_foreign_policy:0 "Defensive Foreign Policy"
 SIC_defensive_foreign_policy_desc:0 "Contrary to what is believed within the PIS-R, a defensive foreign policy is still viable. We should be willing and open to approach nations that we previously have been on tense terms with to secure allies, rather than rattling the saber with demands."
 SIC_commander_in_chief:0 "Dux, Commander-in-Chief"
 SIC_commander_in_chief_desc:0 "The Dux historically has been nearly a ceremonial post, acting as a mere advisor to the legislature, as our national representative to foreign powers, and as the symbolic supreme commander of the militias. Our national executive’s responsibilities should be expanded to be a more decisive force."
 SIC_separation_of_militias:0 "Separation of Militia and Central Government"
 SIC_separation_of_militias_desc:0 "The parish militias have always been a distinctly locally managed institution. While we may introduce more strenuous standards and assist the parishes in funding and equipment uniformity, we should not interfere with the local defense forces unless the situation absolutely requires it."
 SIC_standing_national_guard:0 "A Standing National Guard"
 SIC_standing_national_guard_desc:0 "While we have not necessarily been without a national army, the Guardia Nacional de Sicameon has since its inception almost always been a small force, the sole exception being the Imperial Invasion of 799 ALB. Laying the ground work for greater reliance on our professional military rather than the parish militias will be vital in this coming era."
 SIC_integrate_militias:0 "Integrate the Parish Militias"
 SIC_integrate_militias_desc:0 "The defense of our nation has always relied on the common griffon willing to defend their home, but while valiant, the reliance on individual militias within each parish makes our a disorganized mess in both coordination and logistics. Integrating them into a standardized national system would make these local defense forces far more effective."
 SIC_federal_supremacy_clause:0 "The Federal Supremacy Clause"
 SIC_federal_supremacy_clause_desc:0 "Our national government has always deferred to the parishes in the grand majority of affairs, each and every parish treated as the federal government’s equal. By establishing the central government as the supreme authority, we can enforce far more consistent standards and uniformity."
 SIC_rights_people_parishes:0 "Rights of the People and the Parishes"
 SIC_rights_people_parishes_desc:0 "The parishes and the griffons that live within each parish have fundamental rights that should be upheld, for the national government derives all power from them. While federal actions can be streamlined to increase their effectiveness, every griffon and every parish shall still have their say."
 SIC_strong_gov_strong_nation:0 "A Strong Government, A Stronger Nation"
 SIC_strong_gov_strong_nation_desc:0 "While the voice of every parish and every griffon within them will still be valued and acted upon as they have always been, the long overdue establishment of a swift, supreme authority within our republic will finally allow us to truly contest the power of our neighbors and harness the true powers of our liberty."

 SIC_industrial_base_desc:0 "While initially we were able to keep with the pace of industrialization, especially compared to our neighbors to the east, gradually our modernization efforts have fallen to the wayside. Using our federal government's now increased power, we should create new economic impetuses to resume progress."
 SIC_school_system:0 "Revising the School System"
 SIC_school_system_desc:0 "While we have been far more progressive than our former Imperial neighbors in having public schooling systems for centuries now, it's rapidly becoming clear that religious schooling is becoming insufficient in the increasingly technologically reliant world. A considerable amount of reform will have to be undertaken to ensure the continued effectiveness of our education system."

We will launch a federal study to observe what needs to be done."
 SIC_unifying_science_guilds:0 "Unifying the Scientific Guilds"
 SIC_unifying_science_guilds_desc:0 "The sciences within our nation have proven to be a highly competitive affair, with inventors, engineers, and scientists of all kinds banding together within their own guilds attempting to one up each other, to the detriment of our scientific community as a whole. We need to consolidate these groups if we are to make any real scientific progress."

 SIC_capital_concentration:0 "Capitol Concentration"
 SIC_capital_concentration_desc:0 "Despite the high symbolic importance placed on the equality of the founding Five Cities, Midoria was chosen as the capitol of our federation for a highly strategic reason: being the farthest possible point from any land invasion on the peninsula. While concentrating our industry there would be a break from tradition, it would keep our industrial base safer in the event of war."
 SIC_standardize_weights_measures:0 "Standardizing Weights and Measures"
 SIC_standardize_weights_measures_desc:0 "Across the Griffonian continent, there is an absolutely disorganized mess of measurement systems and standards, with only the Griffonian Empire limitedly successful in creating a uniform system. We should establish a standard national metric system, and with our maritime connections, hopefully this will spread to our neighbor nations."
 SIC_new_school_buildings:0 "Constructing New School Buildings"
 SIC_new_school_buildings_desc:0 "Traditionally we have schooled our youth within our goddess' sanctums, but as our population swells and the need for more specialized teaching facilities and staff only grows, we must construct dedicated school buildings."
 SIC_develop_islands:0 "Develop the Western Islands"
 SIC_develop_islands_desc:0 "Scarlet Island, despite being a founding member of our federation, has generally been underdeveloped. This combined with the recently liberated Jojo Islands being mostly ignored by the Falcorian government other than as a naval post, leaves a great deal of undeveloped territory waiting to be exploited off of the mainland."
 SIC_develop_heartlands:0 "Develop the Peninsular Core"
 SIC_develop_heartlands_desc:0 "Historically our inland territory has been one of rural idyll, covered in sprawling fields of grain, produce, and grazing livestock, only interrupted by the occasional hill and the Leve Forest. While it is a shame to ruin such natural beauty, the demands of a modern economy require that we develop the region."
 SIC_develop_mountains:0 "Develop the Northern Mountains"
 SIC_develop_mountains_desc:0 "The tall Arahno and Snowtop Mountains on our northern border to our present knowledge are relatively bare of useful resources other than magic crystal and the terrain is too rough to build much of use, but with modern construction and mining technology, there may be untapped natural resources now within our grasp."
 SIC_scarlet_lab:0 "Found the Laboratoria de Isla Escarlata"
 SIC_scarlet_lab_desc:0 "Due to Scarlet Island's relatively low population and isolation from the mainland, our surveyors have determined that it is safe to set aside an area of the island to perform various scientific and magical experiments that we wish to keep relatively claudestine.

 SIC_resource_survey:0 "The National Natural Resource Survey"
 SIC_resource_survey_desc:0 "Our economists and logisticians have predicted that in the event of absolute total war breaking out across the continent, every last cache of available war material will be invaluable.

 SIC_practical_curriculum:0 "Emphasizing Practical Curriculum"

 SIC_SESC_project:0 "The S.E.S.C. Project"
 SIC_SESC_project_desc:0 "Our top scientists within the Scarlet Laboratory have come with a potential breakthrough in fluidic computing. They have proposed a revolutionary kind of machine, one that can display our entire economic cycle, predict future trends, and provide simulations on how we can influence it. They call it S.E.S.C., or the Sicameon Economic Simulation Computer, and it could be a boon to our economy if built."
 SIC_crystal_transistors:0 "Prototype Crystal Transistors"
 SIC_crystal_transistors_desc:0 "Through the fine manipulation of magic power and precisely engineered crystal components combined with our current knowledge of electronics, our researchers have built a device much more useful, though more expensive, than the vacuum tube currently being developed. While a technological equivalent can't be feasibly made now, there is much to be learned from these magic prototypes."

 SIC_mortal_backs_hearts_minds_desc:0 "With perhaps the exception of the Idol of Boreas, Griffonian civilization has been built by the countless generations of mortals who have lived and died over the ages. There has been and will not be any divine intervention, our nation is built on the backs, hearts, and minds of the living, mortal people."
 SIC_federal_reserve:0 "Founding the Sicameon Federal Reserve"
 SIC_federal_reserve_desc:0 "With our central government's growing role within the national economy, the legislature has passed an act to establish a central bank, the Banco de la Reserva Federal. This new institution should allow us to stimulate and regulate the economy more effectively."
 SIC_city_universities:0 "Expanding the City Universities"
 SIC_city_universities_desc:0 "Despite having our pioneering public school system well in advance of many Griffonian nations, most higher educational opportunities were restricted to the Five Cities, or to study abroad. With the great expansion and reform of our public schools, there will be many more graduates seeking post-secondary education, and we must fund the city universities to expand in turn."
 SIC_FBIC_act:0 "Passing the SSBF Act"
 SIC_FBIC_act_desc:0 "With the general success of the new Reserva Federal, the legislature has put forward another act to expand the bank's function to that of a national insurance agency as the Sindicato Seguros del Banco Federal, both for the lower banks and for public companies. This should decrease risk across the board and help our economy grow with greater ventures."
 SIC_research_grants:0 "Public Research Grants"
 SIC_research_grants_desc:0 "The final step in our vast body of educational reform, we should create a wide number of public grants to be issued on a competitive basis for various independent research projects, for the future generations who will have gone through the reformed schooling system and obtained a post-secondary degree, to maintain this new scientific momentum for the years to come."
 SIC_modern_peasant:0 "The Modern Peasant"
 SIC_modern_peasant_desc:0 "For all our great efforts, the Sicameonese 'peasant' is no longer merely a farmer toiling in the fields, nor an unskilled worker on the industrial assembly line, but a well-to-do, worldly, and educated middle-class griffon, and we have the greatness, wealth, and modernity of our federation to show for it."

 SIC_examine_militia:0 "Examining the Parish Militias"
 SIC_examine_militia_desc:0 "Ever since our nation was founded, the defense of Sicameon has always relied on the willing fighting griffons of the local parish militias, with little central oversight. With new national authority established, we should take steps toward a national standard, beginning with taking stock of these defense forces."
 SIC_expand_national_guard:0 "Expanding the Standing National Guard"
 SIC_expand_national_guard_desc:0 "The Guardia Nacional has historically been a small force, in peace meant to guard the Dux, the parroquias, and the tribunas and to serve as national police, while in war they are meant to be the professional core of our army. By expanding the Guardia, we can build an army more in line with western Griffonian nations."
 SIC_standardize_militia:0 "Standardizing the Militias"
 SIC_standardize_militia_desc:0 "Issuing new guidelines for uniforms, training, and drilling, and establishing new standards for firearms and their ammunition, and other military kits, and creating a more formal command structure will go a long way to turn the militias into a semi-professional force."
 SIC_grand_defense:0 "A Grand Defensive"
 SIC_grand_defense_desc:0 "As we modernize our forces, there are those that believe we should maintain the old mission of the parish militias and the Guardia Nacional of deterrence, repulsion, and defense, rather than develop a balanced doctrine. Will we heed to doctrinal tradition?"
 SIC_professional_army:0 "A Professional Army"
 SIC_professional_army_desc:0 "As we modernize our forces, there are those that believe that we should fully commit to fielding a fully professional army who are equally adept in offensive and defensive operations. Will we follow these doctrinal ambitions?"
 SIC_abolish_grover_tactics:0 "Abolishing Obsolete Groverian Tactics"
 SIC_abolish_grover_tactics_desc:0 "The age of lines and squares of griffons marching in step, of loading and firing and charging on command, of dash and fire, die schönen säbel, los hermosos sables, is over. This large body of knowledge has been rendered obsolete with the advent of modern war; though we have never fought conventionally in the eyes of our adversaries, we should take care not to employ now suicidal strategy."
 SIC_sycaecia_sappers:0 "The Zapadores of Sycaecia"
 SIC_sycaecia_sappers_desc:0 "Originally the name for the brave peasants who had risked themselves by releasing the levees and dikes to flood out Grover II’s invasion force at the 2nd Battle of the Keowen River, this name has been carried on by our military engineer corps. Combat engineering is proving to be essential in modern warfare and it is paramount that the Sappers are well equipped to maintain their legacy on the modern battlefield."
 SIC_arahno_montaneros:0 "The Arahno Montaneros"
 SIC_arahno_montaneros_desc:0 " Our hardy griffon mountaineers that live in the valley of Arahno Ridge, between the Arahno Mountains and the Snowtops, have always been some of our best troops, often being the first to engage in our storied historic battles. We should mold these units into modern fighting forces who will be unmatched no matter what peak they fight on."
 SIC_scarlet_marinas:0 "The Escarlata Marinas"
 SIC_scarlet_marinas_desc:0 "The Scarlet Marines have their origins in the defenders of the old Protectorate of Isla Escarlata. The island is a natural barrier to the mainland, the griffons who live there skilled at fighting on the beaches and boarding hostile vessels, protecting the peninsula from raiders. Their legacy lives on, and they deserve no less than the best should we need them to defend the Armada or to storm a foreign beachhead."
 SIC_wireless_coordination:0 "Wireless Coordination"
 SIC_wireless_coordination_desc:0 "The practicality of radio for use on land is only just becoming viable in our nation, with some of our first radio commercial towers still under construction in our cities. Despite this, we have seen the value of wireless coordination in the Armada Nacional’s experimental operations aboard ships and should make attempts to miniaturize this technology for the militias and Guardia Nacional."
 SIC_defensive_dykes_focus:0 "Defensive Dikes"
 SIC_defensive_dykes_focus_desc:0 "We have always proven to be able to throw up a defense with whatever may be on hand, famously the sea dikes and river levees around the city of Keowen. Even in this new age of tanks and trucks, we can still hone this tactic of sudden fortification to put up stiff defenses anywhere."
 SIC_unconventional_mobility:0 "Unconventional Mobility"
 SIC_unconventional_mobility_desc:0 "We have never truly fought toe to toe with a large enemy force when we could dictate the terms of engagement, instead always opting to be on the move, striking at the flanks and encircling to sow confusion, through seemingly impassable terrain with novel solutions. It is this mobile ingenuity that we can hone to become a lightning army that can envelope a target before they know what's happening."
 SIC_peasants_not_knights:0 "Peasants, Not Knights"
 SIC_peasants_not_knights_desc:0 "Anywhere else in Griffonia, to be called a peasant is to be called a poor, lowly soul, hardly a griffon at all. But here in Sicameon, we carry such a title with pride, for we can fell any knight, lord, or kaiser should they come our way, we can prosper without such insane notions of feudalism and royalty. And our finest griffons, the Rediarios, are ever ready to ensnare and slay any foolish Seguidor!"
 SIC_procure_modern_equipment:0 "Procuring Modern Equipment"
 SIC_procure_modern_equipment_desc:0 "While our military forces are not the least advanced in the world, the pace of arms and equipment innovation is accelerating rapidly. We should strive to equip our troops with the latest in repeating firearms, smokeless powder, protective helmets, etc."
 SIC_repurpose_agricultural_machines:0 "Repurpose Agricultural Machines"
 SIC_repurpose_agricultural_machines_desc:0 "The mechanization of agriculture has proven to be a boon for our inland farmers, exponentially increasing productivity with their power to move mass quantities of material and prepare greater areas for growing. We can harness these trucks and tractors to move men, supplies, and equipment instead, and thus create much more mobile forces."
 SIC_refit_old_cannons:0 "Refitting Old Cannons"
 SIC_refit_old_cannons_desc:0 "While our artillery corps is largely outdated, mostly consisting of rifled muzzleloaders and breechloaders still firing outdated ammunition, these old guns can be retrofitted with modern carriages, gun shields, recoil mechanisms, and in some cases be rebored, reinforced, and rechambered to fire modern ammunition."
 SIC_allinas_process_modernization:0 "Allinas Process Modernization"
 SIC_allinas_process_modernization_desc:0 "Developed by prolific Allinas Aceropico at Estrella Arms, the Allinas Process is a set of modernization plans for most old firearms in parish and national arsenals to methodically update them to all fire smokeless powder and become either single shot breechloading rifles for reserve use or bring them up to date with the current national service weapon standards."
 SIC_knight_killing_machine:0 "A Knight Slaying Machine"
 SIC_knight_killing_machine_desc:0 "By applying armor plating and a heavy weapon such as a light artillery cannon in such a manner as we would with a warship onto a heavy truck or tractor, we can create a vehicle that is tougher, more heavily armed, and more mobile than any knight. Such machines are already being adopted here in Griffonia and across the sea."
 SIC_adapting_naval_artillery:0 "Adapting Naval Artillery"
 SIC_adapting_naval_artillery_desc:0 "The Armada Nacional has always been leagues ahead of the militias and the Gaurdia Nacional in terms of equipment and weaponry. Some of the lighter secondary batteries could be easily adapted for use on land as field guns, as a ready source of artillery and artillery designs for the militias, and create a degree of standardization with the navy."
 SIC_sycamore_armory:0 "Founding the Sycamore National Armory"
 SIC_sycamore_armory_desc:0 "Sicameon up until this point has never had a national arms factory, as with most other functions of government we have always deferred arms and equipment production to city armories, and more recently, indigenous arms companies such as Estrella. In our bid to increase federal level military capability and self reliance, we should establish a national armory to fulfill the equipment needs of the Guardia Nacional."
 SIC_plowshares_to_swords:0 "Plowshares to Swords"
 SIC_plowshares_to_swords_desc:0 "The Sicameonese people have always had a culture of duality. In peace, we have wielded the trident and the pitchfork to fish and farm to feed our families. In war, we wielded the same to hold the enemy back and defend our liberties. Let us embrace that fact in this new era, as we prepare for the inevitable wars to come!"
 
 ##navy tree
 SIC_unify_flotillas:0 "Formally Unify the Armada Nacional"
 SIC_unify_flotillas_desc:0 "The nation’s navy has historically been far more unified than the parish militias and the Guardia Nacional, because the founding Five Cities were the only entities wealthy enough to fund naval projects, and they all shared the mutual goal of fending off raiders and pirates from the very beginning. Still, the Armada Nacional is divided along the lines of the old city flotillas, these old systems should be replaced to promote unity, end city rivalries, and ease administration."
 SIC_new_naval_infrastructure:0 "New Naval Infrastructure"
 SIC_new_naval_infrastructure_desc:0 "While Sicameon is by no means a navally primitive nation with its historically important trade ports and sole worship of the griffon sea goddess, the ever expanding specialized needs and ever growing overall size of modern ships demand ever more advanced construction and maintenance facilities and more deeply dredged harbors."
 SIC_naval_base_1:0 "Expanding the Escarlata Naval Base"
 SIC_naval_base_1_desc:0 "Isla Escarlata has long stood as a natural defensive barrier between the western seas and the peninsular mainland, and as a good naval post and staging ground for sailing westward as well. These facilities should be modernized for continued service for the foreseeable future."
 SIC_naval_base_2:0 "Expanding the Midoria Naval Base"
 SIC_naval_base_2_desc:0 "Our nation’s capitol has always been a great port of call for seafarers of all kinds, sitting at the geographical center of the southern coast of Griffonia, and the closest continental mainland port to Zebrica. The naval facilities in Midoria should be continuously modernized and expanded with this importance in mind."
 SIC_dockyard_expansion_2:0 "Expanding the Queruscos Shipyards"
 SIC_dockyard_expansion_2_desc:0 "Queruscos has long held the title to have both the finest and the most productive heavy shipyards within the federation. Historically, the city arsenal created an innovative proto-assembly line system that could create an entire ship within a day, where other cities could take weeks and other nations months. Such a legacy of industry should be upheld by expanding and modernizing the cities shipbuilding facilities further."
 SIC_dockyard_expansion_1:0 "Expanding the Eritocefalia Drydocks"
 SIC_dockyard_expansion_1_desc:0 "Long benefitting from trade with Griffonia's eastern nations and always in constant competition with the capitol of Cyanolisia, Eritocefalia's shipyards have been well renowned its' for smaller, nimbler, and more efficient clippers and frigates. Thus naturally the city has supplied the Armada Nacional with many of its' fine fast craft, and modernizing and expanding the city's drydocks is a high priority."
 SIC_light_dockyards:0 "Light Dockyard Standardization"
 SIC_light_dockyards_desc:0 "By cementing our naval doctrine into solely lighter vessels as we have in the past, we have the choice to standardize all of our shipbuilding and maintenance facilities to these smaller craft, resulting in smaller, more efficient, and cheaper infrastructure, but at the cost of our ability to build heavier ships."
 SIC_flexible_dockyards:0 "Flexible Dockyard Standardization"
 SIC_flexible_dockyards_desc:0 "With the major expansions of our navy into much larger ship designs than the past, we now have the experience to standardize our shipbuilding and maintenance facilities to streamline production all kinds of naval craft."
 SIC_naval_review:0 "The New Millennium Naval Review"
 SIC_naval_review_desc:0 "The purpose of a naval review is twofold: to celebrate our long held connections and traditions with the sea and our beloved goddess, and functionally to amass the Armada Nacional for review by our admiralty. Historically it’s been a day of competition between the city flotillas, but this time the fleet sails as one!"
 SIC_analyze_merchant_marine:0 "Analyze the Marina Mercante"
 SIC_analyze_merchant_marine_desc:0 "Being a major trading nation has meant that historically our merchant marine has always been an incredibly important asset to us, both economically and to our maritime defense. While we cannot build merchant ships equivalent to the old East Hindiagriffs of old, we can still look into integrating precautions and developing special tactics for our navy to better protect our merchants on the high seas."
 SIC_prepare_against_piracy:0 "Preparations Against Convoy Raids"
 SIC_prepare_against_piracy_desc:0 "The Marina Mercante has developed based on historical experience a modernized version of our coastal defensive patrols to defend our convoys on the open seas, extending Sycaecia's protecting wing far beyond our coasts."
 SIC_merchant_cruiser:0 "The Destroyer Escort"
 SIC_merchant_cruiser_desc:0 "The history of battle on the seas has repeated itself, only instead of pirates and privateers preying on well to do merchants for personal gain, it’s one nation’s destroyers and submarines and aircraft against another’s civilian convoys. This time however, we can amass a fleet of escorts that is both economically feasible and long enough ranged to protect our convoys anywhere."
 SIC_new_screens:0 "New Screening Vessels"
 SIC_new_screens_desc:0 "From mere sailing sloops to swarming torpedo boats to anti-submarine destroyers and anti-aircraft light cruisers, the naval screen has evolved immensely over the last century and a half, and we have been able to keep pace with it. But the march of progress never stops, even on the waves, so we must continue the designing, innovation, and construction of these steadfast vessels."
 SIC_ASW_warfare:0 "Spearing the Modern Sea Serpent"
 SIC_ASW_warfare_desc:0 "The invention of the fully submersible ship, while wondrous, has opened up a vast new element of naval warfare where an enemy can stalk our merchants and battlefleets like the mythic sea monsters of yore. New weapons and detection systems will have to be developed to hunt down these new steel sea predators."
 SIC_mine_warfare:0 "The Venerable Sea Mine"
 SIC_mine_warfare_desc:0 "The naval mine at this point is an aging invention, but one that has proven still deadly and only growing more lethal despite advances in underwater protection. Minefields have long been part of the theoretical defense of our coastal waters and ports, sitting in many narrows and natural bays, and these plans and their related technologies should continue to be modernized."
 SIC_cruiser_tradition:0 "Sicameonese Cruiser Tradition"
 SIC_cruiser_tradition_desc:0 "Historically, the cruiser has been our capital ship, our nation’s naval pride. While this mantle may pass onto larger and more powerful ships in the future, the cruiser still has a crucial role to play in this new, modern maritime age with its’ great flexibility."
 SIC_aircraft_carrier:0 "An Aircraft Carrier"
 SIC_aircraft_carrier_desc:0 "Many of the younger officers who have grown up with the latest innovations of mechanized flying machines have proposed the idea of creating a ship that is in essence a floating airfield. The concept has already been proven overseas in Equestria and by the Empire before it had collapsed on itself, and we have concluded some of our own first tests of launching aircraft off of an armed warship successfully. Despite the skepticism of some of our older officers, such a dedicated ship might prove to be a potent weapon in the future"
 SIC_secondary_battery_research:0 "A Secondary Education"
 SIC_secondary_battery_research_desc:0 "As our ships grow further and further in size, we find ourselves actually somewhat lacking in one aspect of naval design: secondary batteries. But we are learning quickly, and adapted weaponry from our smaller craft should fit the role soundly."
 SIC_undersea_patrol:0 "An Undersea Patrol"
 SIC_undersea_patrol_desc:0 "The idea to build a ship that can swim within Sycaecia’s vast seas as the fish and other aquatic denizens do is an old one in our mythology, but only became possible relatively recently. While we have already achieved such a marvel of engineering, continuing to pursue advances in submarining will allow us to protect our waters in ways never thought possible before."
 SIC_torpedo_research:0 "The Ship Killing Harpoon"
 SIC_torpedo_research_desc:0 "Ever since the invention of the motorized torpedo, the maritime power balance of the world has been greatly shaken. This little revolution has most benefited smaller nations such as ourselves, with mere boats being able to sink the largest capital ships. While the advantage has slowly waned with improvements in underwater protection, the torpedo is still a lethal weapon that we should continue to hone."
 SIC_study_capital_ships:0 "Studying Modern Capital Ship Design"
 SIC_study_capital_ships_desc:0 "Our naval doctrine has never truly had a place for large capital ship design. Larger ships were always deemed too unwieldy and slow, and most importantly too expensive when the objective was deterrence and fending off coastal raids. However, with the rising continental tension, mere deterrence may not suffice, there is now an incentive to study and begin such ships, beginning with modified Imperial examples."
 SIC_our_own_capital_ship:0 "Our Own Capital Ship"
 SIC_our_own_capital_ship_desc:0 "Our studies have turned up positive. More recent technological developments have proven that a large, fast, well armed, reasonably well armored, and reasonably priced capital ship is possible, and our shipyards are ready to construct a prototype."
 SIC_fast_battleship_committee:0 "The Fast Battleship Committee"
 SIC_fast_battleship_committee_desc:0 "Our research into capital ship design has grown beyond a mere project to a very important section of the Armada Nacional. The admiralty has recommended we formalize this group into a proper committee to better organize these efforts going into the future."
 SIC_modernize_command_structure:0 "Modernize the Command Structure"
 SIC_modernize_command_structure_desc:0 "A newly unified navy also needs massive restructuring in the command structure. Consolidating all of the separate city commands into a single national structure will take a considerable amount of time, but we will reap the benefits of centralized coordination."
 SIC_skirmish_theory:0 "Skirmish Theory"
 SIC_skirmish_theory_desc:0 "Traditionally, we have tried to never engage enemy fleets in an equal pitched battle, for our main enemies have always had greater manpower reserves and industrial capacity to absorb losses. As such we’ve always attempted to skirmish and dictate the terms of battle with our fleet’s speed, and we can hone this doctrine by adding blending traditional battlefleet strategy into ours."
 SIC_carrier_theory:0 "Carrier Theory"
 SIC_carrier_theory_desc:0 "Proponents from our fledgling mechanized air corps have suggested and steadily pushed the idea of a floating airfield ship, delivering rounds not by gunpowder and rifled barrels, but by piloted aircraft instead. It is not an entirely new idea, as both the Empire and Equestria have experimented with such aircraft carriers, they may prove to be a dominant naval weapon if we have the capacity to support them."
 SIC_midoria_naval_academy:0 "Founding the National Naval Academy"
 SIC_midoria_naval_academy_desc:0 "Now that we have consolidated our command structure, it’s time to consolidate our officer training program. In line with much of our centralization restructuring, the Midoria Naval Academy will be designated and expanded for this purpose."
 SIC_next_generation_officers:0 "A New Generation of Officers"
 SIC_next_generation_officers_desc:0 "The first generation of naval officers have graduated after our extensive series of reforms, and our instructors report that the decks will be awash with new doctrinal ideas."
 
 ##air force tree
 SIC_found_air_corps:0 "Founding the Mechanized Air Corps"
 SIC_found_air_corps_desc:0 "Griffons have always had winged regiments within their militaries, but the advent of powered flight has propelled the air into a theater of war far vaster than ever realized before. We must keep the pace by establishing a mechanized air corps if we wish to keep the skies as free as our land and sea."
 SIC_dusters_to_fighters:0 "From Dusters to Fighters"
 SIC_dusters_to_fighters_desc:0 "A small group of our inland farming communes have purchased high performance aircraft for spreading seeds, fertilizer, and pesticides across their fields with remarkable speed. We should purchase some examples of these aircraft for modification into our first fighters."
 SIC_first_bomber:0 "Our First Bomber"
 SIC_first_bomber_desc:0 "Eyewitnesses from our troops during our occupation of the Jojo Islands of Wingbardian aircraft bombarding Falcorian positions during their 985 ALB war have proven that aerial bombing could be a powerful tactic in the near future. Modifying a civilian transport aircraft will be a good start for our own bombers."
 SIC_arahno_school:0 "Establishing the Arahno Air School"
 SIC_arahno_school_desc:0 "Establishing a new air school in northern Leve province provides a number of benefits: all types of regions for new pilots to fly over within the nation, a useful northern airbase, and a place to develop new mechanized air doctrine."
 SIC_radio_detection:0 "Developing Radio Detection"
 SIC_radio_detection_desc:0 "As radio towers continue to be erected across the federation, our naval engineers have tinkered with the novel idea of detecting objects through radio signal pulses. Such experimental devices have been mounted both on civilian and naval ships as early collision warning systems, and our aviation engineers believe this could be useful for detecting aircraft."
 SIC_strafing_talent:0 "Natural Strafing Talent"
 SIC_strafing_talent_desc:0 "Being the natural brethren of those low flying seabirds who skim the ocean surface and even dive underwater for fish, our pilots have a natural grasp of low flying air attacks. We should capitalize on this natural gift and develop our close air support tactics."
 SIC_adapting_patrols:0 "Adapting the Coastal Patrol"
 SIC_adapting_patrols_desc:0 "Our city militias have historically been charged with the task to provide coastal security in the form of patrol groups of griffons who fly along the shoreline, keeping an eye out for suspicious goings-on. Such experience could be adapted to suit our new air corps as coastal defense against enemy naval vessels."
 SIC_support_doctrine:0 "Close Support Doctrine"
 SIC_support_doctrine_desc:0 "Our pilots' natural talents have been honed into true battle strategies. From this point on, they only need to be honed in battle and tempered through combat experience."
 SIC_sea_hawkeyes:0 "The Seahawkeyes"
 SIC_sea_hawkeyes_desc:0 "The title of a Sea Hawkeye was one only reserved for the finest patrolgriffs, marines, and sailors with astounding senses and combat prowess. But now it graces our best naval air combat squadrons, taking on a far more important role than ever before, taking mechanized airpower to combat our enemies on the high seas."
 SIC_barnstormer_squadron:0 "The Barnstormer Squadron"
 SIC_barnstormer_squadron_desc:0 "Taking the name from skilled and daring crack stunt pilots, the Barnstormer Squadron makes up of our finest fighter pilots, making use of risky and unorthodox tactics as their namesake implies."
 SIC_floating_airfield:0 "A Floating Airfield"
 SIC_floating_airfield_desc:0 "Collaborating with our younger naval officers, our aviation staff have pushed the idea of deploying combat squadrons from specially designed ships that act essentially as floating mobile airfields. The ability to project airpower in such a way is undoubtably a very powerful one, and is also being explored by foreign powers. Resources permitting, we should experiment with adapting aircraft and ships to such a task."

Its populace suffered greatly and the islands lost half of their population, most of whom fled to Sicameon in desperation. After the war, the remaining islanders decided to hold a referendum about seceding from Falcor and joining our Federation. They never received permission from the Princess to do so, but went through with their plans anyways. The referendum passed and the islands requested us to annex them, which we did in the name of democracy. The ravaged and war-exhausted Falcorian army and navy could do little to resist us. However, to this day the monarchy has refused to acknowledge the annexation as legitimate. Our relations with the Principality are strained at best.\n\nSome of our diplomats are now proposing something rather radical, if we ever wish to earn Falcor's trust and friendship. We could cede them the islands as a gift. While many protested this idea, many others saw that it might be the only option if we wish to mend our fences."
