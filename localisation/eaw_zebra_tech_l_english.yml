    tech_spirit_warriors_desc:0 "Why should we stick to conventional warfare when the spirits themselves are on our side? We could create cadres of fighters to use voodoo to wreck havoc on our forces"
    tech_spirit_warriors2_desc:0 "Not all alchemy is strictly voodoo. Conventional remedies and healing potions should keep them fighting long after others would drop"
    tech_spirit_warriors3_desc:0 "Alchemy and voodoo will only get you so far. Providing better equipment will make help our warriors survive"
    tech_spirit_warriors4_desc:0 "True voodoo is a powerful art, but incredibly dangerous. We are ready to begin taking the first steps to harness our traditions to make our chargers the greatest fighters of all time"
    tech_spirit_warriors5_desc:0 "More refined ingredients, better training, improved equipment. As always, there are a number of small things that can be improved to add up to a larger increase in effectiveness"
    tech_spirit_warriors6_desc:0 "We have reached the endpoint of our craft; this our magnum opus. Our chargers are more resilient than ever"
    tech_zebra_climate_desc:0 "Zebras are a fairly versatile species. We can live comfortably in jungles and deserts. We should take maximum advantage of this where possible"
    tech_zebra_jungle_desc:0 "Jungles are hot, humid, and above all else, hellish. For everyone else. For us, they need not be such barriers."
    tech_zebra_jungle2_desc:0 "The dangers of the jungles are our boons. With a little resourcefulness, we can utilize exotic creatures for our own ends"
    tech_zebra_desert_desc:0 "Deserts are hot, typically open, and full of sand. This may be boring, but we are already well adapted to them. We should take maximum advantage of this where possible"
    tech_zebra_desert2_desc:0 "Another thing about deserts; they tend to be flat. With some effort, we could coordinate a mass charge the likes the world has never seen, where the terrain favours it"
    tech_spirit_warrior_instincts_desc:0 "Our chargers have a sense for danger unlike any other. Training them to hone this sense will make them even more dangerous"
    tech_spirit_warrior_trickeback_desc:0 "Death does not have to be the end. If the proper rituals can be intoned in time, we can save them and return them to duty"
    tech_zebra_alchemy_desc:0 "A little alchemy goes a long way. With some changes to our soldiers diets, we can ensure they will be at their best in battle at all times"
    tech_concentration_potions_desc:0 "It's only logical that a stronger potion will have better effects. Improved refinement techniques will get us there" 
    tech_nigh_vision_potions_desc:0 "It's much easier to attack in the dark if you can see in the dark. These practical potions will help with that"
    tech_hp_potions_desc:0 "Not all potions harm. Some can be quite medicinal. Equipping our warriors with these will only increase their longterm survivability"
    tech_energy_potions_desc:0 "These potions will give our soldiers the strength to carry on through the harshest of conditions and the worst of weather"
    tech_extreme_potion_concentration_desc:0 "These potions are so refined that they could kill a mare on their own, but our warriors can handle them, making them a force to be reckoned with"
    tech_spirit_warrior_anti_tank_desc:0 "Some liquids are extremely dangerous. These particular ones melt through armor as if it were wet paper. Equipping our chargers with these will only increase their effectiveness""
    tech_zebra_crafting_desc:0 "Traditional Zebra methods are spectacular; but we can improve on the old ways."
    zebra_pragmatic_production_desc:0 "Tradition dictates pragmatism over flair. Our tools, though inelegant, are capable of serving more than one purpose."
    zebra_earth_exploitation_desc:0 "The ground is ripe to plunder; with our special techniques, we will prize more from the land than ever, and make better use of it while we're there"
    zebra_alchemical_oil_desc:0 "It might not be the real thing, but it's certainly good enough to serve as a viable substitute"
    zebra_ritual_crafting_desc:0 "These tools are more than tools. Each one was made for a singular purpose, and for that singular purpose it will be used, and it will excel"
    zebra_one_with_nature_desc:0 "Nature provides everything we need; and we only need look to it, to further enhance our careful craft"
    zebra_alchemical_fertilizer_desc:0 "Alchemy need not be all about war and medicine. There are more than a few domestic uses for it"
    zebra_ancient_steel_desc:0 "Others will say what they may, but Zebrica was the first to make steel, and we know how to work it like no others"
    zebra_mass_steel_production_desc:0 "The more steel we can work, the more troops we can arm"
    zebra_soulless_steel_desc:0 "It may mean desecrating our ancient rites, but the benefits outweight the costs..."
    zebra_relicts_of_past_desc:0 "The Witchers are relics of the past. We must continue looking to the future for our answers, for they will provide them in time"
    zebra_steel_rituals_desc:0 "Performing rites and rituals over the steel for our most elite warriors ensures their power and effectiveness"
    zebra_bounded_weapons_desc:0 "Some say our weapons, made as they are, have souls. They may be right, they may be wrong, but those who use them for extended periods of time find them ever more familiar""
    zebra_warriors_of_new_age_desc:0 "Our traditions make us strong, and as we march into a new age, we will bring those traditions with us"
