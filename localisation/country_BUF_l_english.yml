bufstate.9.t_small_traders:0 "The Equestrian Traders."
bufstate.9.d_small_traders:0 "The Equestrian traders are importing more and more goods into our lands. Modern industrial tools, too. There aren't that many of them. However, there are some concerns about the future of our economics."

bufstate.9.d_establishing_production:0 "More and more of Equestrian traders are moving into our land. They're establishing their companies and businesses, they don't pay the buffalos as much as they pay the pony workers. The buffalos are becoming the source of cheap labour for them.

bufstate.12.t:0 "Buffalo Region?"
bufstate.12.d:0 "The chiefs have decided: For the betterment of the buffalo society, [BUF.GetName] needs to become a part of Equestria, to open its borders and accept pony's friendship. Let their princess guide us now."
bufstate.12.a:0 "Full integration."
bufstate.12.b:0 "Autonomous Region."
bufstate.13.t:0 "Ponies protest against regulations"
bufstate.13.d:0 "Several larger corporations have agitated their workers to strike against the regulations imposed by our government. They may disagree, but the regulations are essential to protect our fragile economy and our people from becoming slaves of the monopolies. What shall we do with the strikers?"
bufstate.13.a:0 "Let them be."
bufstate.13.b:0 "Pay them."
bufstate.14.t:0 "The Strikes Continue"
bufstate.14.d:0 "The strikes have continued for weeks, yet the workers, bribed by the companies, do not want to stop their routine of standing with posters in the centers of our villages. The chiefs have decided to send a formal appeal to Princess Celestia to stop this affair."
bufstate.14.a:0 "We'll solve this alone."
bufstate.14.b:0 "Princess Celestia will calm them down."
