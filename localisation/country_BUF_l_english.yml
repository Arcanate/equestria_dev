#farwander election events
bufstate.1.t:0 "Who is Farwander?"
bufstate.1.d:0 "Look, I'm not going to sit here and lie to myself, I'm not a perfect messiah who's come from the more civilized Equestria to save the Buffalo from themselves. Even though I kind of am one.. That is not why I came back, I came back because while the Equestrians have all the land, resources, power and riches one could ask for, my people starve. \n\nWe are set so far back, we're more of a loose confederation of buffalo than a proper nation - a tiny blot on the map ponies mistake for a coffee stain. I have an obligation to help them, an obligation to my people. I've lived in Equestria for a majority of my life, my parents sent me there when I was young so that I could have a better life. Sent to a boarding school in rockville to get an education. \n\n The differences between Equestria and the Buffalo chiefdoms is astounding, while we live in tents and barely survive off our barren lands the Equestrians have so much food that if I were to be placed in the middle of Rockville (only one of the dozens of cities in Equestria!) I could find atleast 60 places to get something to eat.\n\nIn the Chiefdoms we have to wait for harvests, rationing our food just enough so that we can survive till the next one and start the process all over again. We have no time for neither industry or science, because when your starving to death you don't quite have time to sit and think about gravity and machines."
bufstate.1.a:0 "But why do this?"
bufstate.4.t:0 "Friendship Sessions"
bufstate.4.d:0 "The Equestrian agents arrived this night, they bring with them more propaganda than I could ever muster alone, there are many of my people that are suspicious of everything foreign yet never realize that there can ever be domestic threats. When the big bad boogeyman is coming for them they forget that their own kinsmen could be anything but good. They split themselves by tribal lines and whether they like you or not depends on if your one of them or not. \n\nBut not truly... Its not that your not them, its that your a different tribe. But me? Im not in any tribe, I am not bound to any caste and this gives me freedom. They judge me less because im a neutral party, while im not friend im neither foe. \n\nAnd you know what they say, keep your friends close and your enemies far away. While I let Ponies make friends with Buffalo we get connections within the chiefdom, my years outside have left me without a social network but the ponies are loyal to me, they want nothing more than to do what's best for Equestria, and their orders are that what I do is best for Equestria. \n\nAnd so i get the resources of the world superpower behind my back with enough propaganda, connections, money and distance from any tribes that my victory is all but assured. Oh Thunderhoof, Greyhorn, while you may think this is a big game for becoming Chief its really rather not. For you two were never even players, it was all about who the ponies wanted. When your trying to win in a democratic election its all on how many bits you can use to stack the deck."
bufstate.4.a:0 "Sorry Chief, the election was rigged from the start."
bufstate.5.t:0 "Equestrian Co-Operation Begins"
bufstate.5.d:0 "The Equestrians are quite easy to predict, tell them you like harmony, tell them friendship is magical and they cave to your demands faster than you can say 'Dear Princess Celestia'. Technology, industry, resources, power. All of this will be ours when i win, the Buffalo Chiefdoms will no longer be some garbage backwater bunch of tribes. There will be no more of the neutrality or pretending not to pick sides. We have chosen a side and we will stick to it for as long as we gain something. Why should the Equestrians keep all the nice things? I do believe its time for the Equestrians to share some of those sweet sweet bits of theirs... Maybe part ways with some of their schematics, maybe even send us something to eat for lunch. \n\n\n\nAh, the possibilities are endless."
bufstate.5.a:0 "Maybe a hayburger?"
bufstate.6.t:0 "Peace and Prosperity"
bufstate.6.d:0 "War will get us nothing but a nation of headstones populated by bones, the Equestrians out-class us in every single way measurable and beyond, more advanced technologically magically and culturally. They are a titan while we are an ant, the moment we get annoying they will crush us out of existence. Thunderhoof's weakness does nothing but let the nationalists rhetoric sound more and more right, all he does is let Greyhorn and his supporters be correct in saying that it is his weakness that will lead to us becoming more stagnand and corrupt than ever before, letting Greyhorn seize power once and for all. It is nothing but a slow march off a cliff while we put on a blindfold and pretend nothing is happening. 'Oh your just paranoid, it's fine, here ill jump off first and then you alright?' Sheeps to the slaughter the lot of them. \n\nWe must work together with the Equestrians to get what we need, their aid and support will give us a golden age for all Buffalo kind and even if it does not solve many of our woes it will be better than closing our eyes and putting our hoofs to our ears. Enough is enough, the status quo is garbage and im tired of living in the trash."
bufstate.6.a:0 "Peace sounds nice indeed..."
bufstate.7.t:0 "The Great Gallop Forwards"
bufstate.7.d:0 "We do not need to crawl slowly towards the future as we do now, we must not lag behind the world because of 'traditions', we need to stop thinking of the past and finally look to the future. Enough of the reminiscing it's time to look forward! We must not just make great strides but keep a Great Gallop Forwards! We must gallop to the future at the pace we make on our sacred grounds! Enough with the tribal life we have right now, we must invest in the sciences invest in an industry! Move forwards and skip the bronze age and go straight to the industrial one! The Buffalo will no longer be a backwater but a truly modern society that all the world shall adore! Our beautiful tapestries exported for all the world to see as we get assembly line pies cheaply and efficiently!"
bufstate.7.a:0 "The future is now old Chiefs"
bufstate.8.t:0 "Promises of Wealth"
bufstate.8.d:0 "Farwander is holding a speech tonight on the future of the Buffalo, of what she wants to achieve. As the stage is set, the microphone placed and all lights and eyes on her Farwander begins looking at the hundreds of Buffalo who had gathered to listen to her speech. Already much of what she said had resonated with her people, many tiring of the constant poverty, the illiteracy, all of her propaganda was forced to be pictograms as otherwise only one in a hundred Buffalo would actually be able to understand them. \n\nSo as she stood there looking at her people, all staring at her with hope for what she was to say, hope that maybe, just maybe, she would help them.. She felt a lump in her throat as she began and spoke. \n\n"My brothers and sisters, today i have come to tell you the truth. Thunderhoof has done nothing but keep the status quo that we have going, done nothing but keep us poor and dumb so that he can keep his power. Why do we keep doing this? Why do we keep picking leaders who do nothing to change anything yet say they've done it all.. We have to modernise for the good of all Buffalokind, we have to actually advance if we want to stop our mothers and children dying in birth, to stop having to pray to the gods all day and night in hope that the harvest not rot."\n\n It felt horrible, so horrible, a lump in her gut that filled her with sadness as tears started to bubble at her eyes. \n\n"We have to do something lest we all keep losing our loved ones to preventable deaths that we could have stopped had we just stopped being so stubborn.. My own parents died to the pox, had we accepted the Equestrian aid we would have been able to create inoculation stations, stopping the pox from ever spreading. I do not want anyone else to suffer the same fate, and the Equestrians will help us do so, the Equestrians will help us modernize and give us what we have needed for decades. Its time we bite the pie so that our children don't die deaths that we could have prevented." She told them, and many Buffalo empathized, their own family had been struck by the diseases and mortality she spoke of, starving to death in bad harvests and having to pick lots on who gets to survive... \n\nThey wanted change and so did she."
bufstate.8.a:0 "Never Again"
bufstate.9.t:0 "Equestrian Support For Farwander"
bufstate.9.d:0 "The Equestrians adore me oh so much, the cute Buffalo married to a Pony who is now running as a pony friendly candidate in the Buffalo elections, they practically gave me a blank check and told me to fill in the numbers. The entirety of the Equestrian foreign 'diplomats' at my disposal as well, it makes life oh so much easier for me as the moment Thunderhoof coughs i get informed, and when he makes a mistake i let someone leak it to the press, they have their field day and suddenly the surveys say he has dropped, Greyhorn is not immune either and that buffalo is just a gold-mine for controversy. \n\nAnd yet the press get nothing but good news of me, every day i've done some new wonderful positive fact both real and fictional, yet with enough stories no one bothers to check what is and isn't actually happening. I can sit back, relax, and let the good news wash over me while Thunderhoof and Greyhorn fight in the mud over which of them is going to beat me in the election. Oh ill just have to tell them to get back inside before sundown, such children. \n\nNow go off on your merry way, i hear a 'diplomat' knocking on the door."
bufstate.9.a:0 "Sorry to bother you"
bufstate.10.t:0 "The Sacred Texts"
bufstate.10.d:0 "Ever since i was a little Buffalo i loved hearing the stories of our past, my mother would sit besides me in our tent as the campfire flame flickered and tell me the story of how the crow saved us all from eternal winter, tell me the story of the brave Buffalo warriors beating back the strange creatures from the north that would pretend to be one of us, the tale of the Winged Buffalo god who would fly to the skies and give the children pieces of the clouds as a treat... Ah such nice times... \n\nBut nowadays many people get the stories wrong, mistelling them, forgetting bits and pieces and just failing in retelling them, our oral tradition cannot keep going forever when we can record the official stories and make sure that we all have the same foundation we're drawing from. I do not want the Buffalo lore to die but to survive long after we all hit the hay, i want our children to hear the stories the way we heard them.\n\nI want us all to tell each other these stories for centuries more to come."
bufstate.10.a:0 "Yes mother, now tell me the story of the Crow again!"
bufstate.11.t:0 "A Future Together"
bufstate.11.d:0 "And so it begins, I look down to the massive crowd, thousands of Buffalo have gathered here and dozens of Equestrian Journalists flock the front of the massive stage. The stage had been built specifically for this speech, tapestries that cover the bottom to top filled with the stories of the Buffalo which at the top had a model of the rainbow crow in its blackest blacks. The stage floor was of Buffalo carpet, a famous material sold to many rich families and being the main export of the Chiefdoms. Their life in tents lended itself to needing a soft movable floor and so the Buffalo slowly made them into pieces of art, filling them with beautiful patterns that one could sit and stare at for hours. And so as Farwander prepared to begin this already felt more like a show than a speech, untill she began to speak.\n\n"My brethren! My sisters! I see for us a future where we can finally reach the potential that our humble Chiefdoms have! Where we will not starve nor cry for nourishment, where we will not have to dote upon each of our plants as if they were our last, where if one gets sick they will be cured and everyone has a dinner with enough bread cheese and yoghurt for us all! Where we will finally get proper sewage, proper roads, to live like a modern society for we WILL be a modern society! No longer shall we live in antiquity while others gawk at us like a museum being kept alive only to serve others, we will forge our own destiny, but we will not forge it alone. For just as the crow's beauty cannot be seen alone...""
bufstate.11.a:0 "A good start.."
bufstate.12.t:0 "Equestrian Technology"
bufstate.12.d:0 "Curious visitors arrived from Equestria today, invited by Farwander herself. They brought with them all kinds of gadgets and machines and vehicles, which many buffalos were in awe of. How could ponies bend metal into such strange shapes and forms? None of them knew, except for Farwander, who smiled as she saw their reaction. The act hadn't even begun, yet she was already impressing them.\n\nThe two Equestrians, who not only looked alike but dressed alike as well, introduced themselves as Flim and Flam, travelling businessponies. They inquired the buffalo about their daily lives, about how long it took to travel from place to place, how much time it took to craft tools, how many hours one had to spend to gather and grow food. They theatrically emphatized with the buffalos as they described their hard lives and mourned. Flim said "If only life could be somehow made easier!" to which Flam replied "Well, my brother, what if I told you it COULD?" He then stepped aside and presented the miracle machines behind them: The tractor, the machine tools, the car, the radio, the electric light and more. Soon Flim joined him and the two began to sing of the numerous wondrous features of the equipment, about how greatly all of them improved the quality of life. In the song they, of course, kept repeating that only Farwander could offer them such things.\n\nAt the end they bowed before the cheering audience who stomped the ground in excitement. However, one buffalo was not impressed and grunted. Greyhorn called Flim and Flam conponies who told nothing but lies. Those gadgets were too good to be true, he claimed. Farwander quickly responded by hopping on the tractor and driving it around the area, letting young Buffalo and old sit with her as she drove. The buffalo laughed and chanted Farwander's name."
bufstate.12.a:0 "SWIGGITY SWOOTY IM COMIN FOR DAT SUN BOOTY"
bufstate.13.t:0 "Farwander's Ideals"
bufstate.13.d:0 "I want nothing more than to help the Buffalo, to make them into a true Buffalo nation with glimmering cities and beautiful sights. Where every Buffalo will have an equal chance at a good life without fear of starvation nor disease, where every Buffalo big or small can be what they want to be with no fear of rejection. Harmony will reign supreme and i will not have it otherwise, for   order builds, chaos destroys. Peace will be mandatory and i will not let our tribalism craft another schism within us once more. We will be modern, we will be mighty. It will be a golden era for the Buffalo never seen before. That is what i promise my people and it is what i will give them."
bufstate.13.a:0 "Truly ideals to live by."
bufstate.35.t:0 "Why do this, though?"
bufstate.35.d:0 "The most advanced thing I ever saw was old Bigthink's electric lamp... Functioning with a step-pedal that produced just enough energy to make it glow slightly... It was beautiful to me at the time, I would go to his home and pedal away staring at the electrical wonder. It fascinated me, so when my parents sent me to Equestria and I saw how they lived... \n\nIt was like I had travelled five-hundred years into the future. There were street lamps everywhere, massive metal machines moving faster than they could ever run! Everyone had plumbing and in everyone's home they could move a little metal lever and get as much water as one could ever ask for! No more working the pump for an hour to get enough water for the afternoon! \n\nAnd so what first started as wonderment started to turn to guilt, i had everything i could ever ask for while my family, my people.. They had nothing.. So I promised myself that I would do something for them, that I would help my people and stop the starvation. No more of Thunderhoof's isolation, the stubborn oat declined all the Equestrian oats because 'The Buffalo shall not consume anything not grown by and for Buffalo!' \n\nThis will change, I'm going to work with Equestria to wake our lands from their hibernation and bring us forwards to modernity. We must industrialise for the good of all Buffalo."
bufstate.35.a:0 "We must save our people from themselves."
bufstate.36.t:0 "And Thus She Arrives"
bufstate.36.d:0 "And that is when they heard her booming voice, the voice of not a Buffalo but a Princess. The Princess herself Celestia as she flew into the air and hovered in front of the sun called to the Buffalo, 'For it needed the light of the sun to truly shine!'  using her powers in such a way as to make the light hit just right to make the crow's feathers glow in a cascade of colors, as the colors themselves flew into the crowd as a show of light, colors many Buffalo had not even ever seen before all making themselves clear as Celestia stood there, a monument to Equestrian power and regality. A living god helping theirs shine bright. \n\nEven the most uneducated Buffalo understood the symbolism, and they cheered, they cheered and all called her name, "Celestia! Celestia! Celestia!" And the Princess smiled, Farbrook finally got in a sigh of relief as it went well. The Buffalo wanted nothing more than to have a bright future, and finally for the first time in their lives they had seen one."

#Thunderhoof election events
bufstate.2.t:0 "Who is Thunderhoof?"
bufstate.2.d:0 "Chief Thunderhoof has been with the Buffalo tribes since he was a little calf, his father was the chief before him and his father's father was the chief. Thunderhoof had seen the Buffalo through many crises, from the droughts of the past to the great troubles. Where Buffalo split themselves upon tribal lines and neared a civil war over their religious and cultural differences. The great slaughter of 998 nearly caused a war with the Equestrians thanks to Pony immunity to Buffalo laws and customs. \n\nAnd so as the great chief was forced to put out fire after fire that his people kept conjuring and fuelling he started to grow cynical, doubtful of if the Buffalo could ever modernize or become better. Entering a decade of stagnation as social norms stayed and the nation was stuck in the past, not moving neither an inch forward nor an inch backwards. But as the election comes other candidates have put their names on the ballot, forcing Thunderhoof to finally for once take a stand and get to work. Now he has competition, now he must prove that he is the best one to lead the Buffalo."
bufstate.2.a:0 "He may not bring change but he brings stability."
bufstate.14.t:0 "Propaganda Posters"
bufstate.14.d:0 "The Buffalo didn’t notice at first when the posters came. Maybe a single flyer pinned to a board with a nail or a drawing in the sand to catch a passerby’s eye at first. But they increased. Mimeographed pieces of paper or wood showing gruesome or glorious scenes with buffalo in them appeared first on the public boards. \n\nThen they came for the houses. Every wall, sometimes overnight would have one of the posters hanging from the walls. Some were torn down, only for them to be replaced the next day. \n\nAnd then, then they came for the doors. Sometimes, the whole door, or tent was turned into a billboard for Chief Thunderhoof. No one ever found out who was behind them. If someone caught the buffalo putting them up in the act, they would flee. But the posters always remained. Always."
bufstate.14.a:0 "Maybe he's not so bad."
bufstate.15.t:0 "Improving The Status Quo"
bufstate.15.d:0 "As Thunderhoof stood in the middle of the plaza he watched as more and more Buffalo joined in, walking down the dirt paths and sitting down, families and friends here to hear what the Chief had to say, what he had to offer. What was going to change, what was going to stay. And the sight struck Thunderhoof deeply, standing in the middle of the large tide of all Buffalo all watching his every moment, breaths and blinks included. He felt a guilt swell up, a guilty of how he should have done more, how he should have helped them better. He shook his head slightly, coughed and began. \n\n"My brethren and sisters whom have gathered here today, I speak to you now not for empty promises but for real change. Our nation has grown stale and stagnant, stuck in the past with neither reform nor change, neither improvement nor deterioration. And I know that what we have now is worse than a decline, it is worse to be stuck than to be doing something and, while taking steps is easy, standing still though is hard. For we must choose to stand still, choose not to improve nor become better. And I will not have that we stand still while the rest of the world moves. It is time for improvements that better the Buffalo but, do not shake us to our core, to properly improve and become better through steady reforms and proper change. If you vote for me, I promise to make the Buffalo move forwards, no matter the difficulties or troubles.  The heat will not stop us, the ponies will not stop us, and we will not stop ourselves.""
bufstate.15.a:0 "Finally some improvement."
bufstate.16.t:0 "The Path Of Neutrality"
bufstate.16.d:0 "A lot of Thunderhoof's foreign affairs include his policy of neutrality, forcing itself into all facets of politics, no matter what. Never choosing a side in a conflict. While many praise it as letting the great Chief mediate between conflicts of tribes, in reality it just means the Chief doesn't need to think on which side is actually right, letting him get back to sipping his Crystal Empire made tea, as he sits on his veranda, listening to music on his Equestrian gramophone with his discs from Skyfall. The Chief was famously neutral in all but his purchases. \n\nBut there are pros and cons to this cowardly path of neutrality, namely the fact that it has kept the Buffalo out of any wars. Peace has reigned for centuries, and no buffalo have died due to wars, no buffalo have died due to Equestrian bombing. \n\nSo like many things, this policy has its pros and cons. This has been Trouty Fisk reporting for the Canterlot Independent."
bufstate.16.a:0 "Seems a bit biased."
bufstate.17.t:0 "Tell The Buffalo The Truth"
bufstate.17.d:0 "As the chief calls the tribes of the Buffalo lands together to converge in a great gathering there are murmurs throughout the massive caravans making their way, spreading rumors of what the Chief called them there for, rumors of if this might be his attempt at gathering his political opponents to end them, the rumors getting progressively more creative, silly and complex before finally coalescing into some Buffalo imagining that there was a massive Goat conspiracy.\n\nBut as they arrived and the Chief prepared, things returned to a sense of normalcy the Buffalo having arrived and all being ready. This time the Chief had prepared a stage and microphone, many of the  Buffalo confused as to what they were but soon understanding as the great Chief coughed and his voice echoed throughout the gathering. And so he began. \n\n"I have called you all here to tell you the truth. To tell you the real truth and the one that my people should have been told long ago, and that is-" He sighs as he looks down at his people, all standing there, journalists from Equestria taking snapshots and the insufferable Fisk noting things down in his notepad."
bufstate.17.a:0 "What is it?"
bufstate.37.t:0 "Telling The Truth"
bufstate.37.d:0 ""And that is that we will never regain the great Buffalo lands of the past, we will not become a Buffalo Empire and we will never be able to beat Equestria in a fight. We are not capable of it, our military is not capable of it and they outnumber us a thousand to one. If we were to declare war we would be wiped out in a week and anything we had will be forgotten, the only reason we are alive is because the Equestrians do not care enough to eliminate us. And that is why the rhetoric of The Elder Greyhorn is so dangerous, why it is such a danger to us all and why if you vote for him you will doom us all to death. What he promises will never arrive and we will die if we try. So please, just understand. I am not lazy nor a coward. I have just understood the reality of our situation and i wish for you all to do as well." \n\nThe crowd grew angry, angrier than many of the Buffalo had been before. Here was their Great Chief the one they trusted telling them that the only reason they were alive was because the ponies didn't care enough to eliminate them. And they yelled at the Chief, hurled insults and pies at him. But the Chief stood there. Taking it all in a stoic pose of might. And once the crowd was tuckered out from anger many began to cry. Cry for they knew that deep down the Chief was right."
bufstate.37.a:0 "He's wrong, right? He has to be..."
bufstate.18.t:0 "The Infinite Promises"
bufstate.18.d:0 "Though the great chief promised only minor changes at first, his ambition seemed to grow as time went on. Seeing the fact that Greyhorn and Farwander were both finding massive success within their lofty promises he surely must have felt emboldened to try his hand at some more difficult promises to keep but that would surely make the Buffalo's happy as can be. And so it began, first he promised them to become a society as modern as a Griffonian one, then an Equestrian one, before starting to promise that the Buffalo would outdo even the Equestrians themselves. \n\nThat every Buffalo would find their coffers filled with enough gold to make a Griffon cry, to have a home so nice even Blueblood would grow jealous, to have enough land that even Rockhoof himself would grumble in rage. \n\nBut now if he can keep these promises, well that remains to be seen. Myself? I doubt it. Signed, Trouty Fisk reporting for the Canterlot independant."
bufstate.18.a:0 "Well, maybe he will actually do it!"
bufstate.19.t:0 "Promises Of Peace"
bufstate.19.d:0 "The field outside Appeloosa was packed with both buffalos and ponies. There was a palpable tension in the air, and both groups kept to themselves. All eyes, however, were fixed on chief Thunderhoof where he stood high on the cliffs above, eschewing a constructed stage to use what the world provided as he spoke. With no microphone, his voice nevertheless could rumble loudly enough that every last onlooker could hear him. \n\n"Many moons ago, on this very day eight years ago as the ponies count it, I led our people to war. We surged over these hills like a stormfront, and against us were arrayed a host of ponies, determined and well armed. That time, we Buffalo were going to fight for what was ours by right and tradition. We were going to fight to be Buffalo.\n\nIn the last moment, our hooves were stayed. In the eleventh hour we found another path, and even today there are those who would call the aborted battle a betrayal of what it is to be Buffalo. I say no. I say, that in that moment, we Buffalo were wise enough to remember the unity of all living things. We remember how we roam so that we do not bring permanent harm to any part of the plains, we take what we need from what Mother Nature offers, and we fight to live, not to die.\n\nThe world may have changed, but the Buffalo have not. My people. I say to you, with all of you and with these gathered ponies as witnesses to my word, that never again shall the Buffalo march to war like that again! We shall not tread that dark path, no matter how the world may rock us. The winds of change shall scream at us and urge us to take up violence, and we shall tell them 'no'.  Outlanders will try us and provoke us, and we shall stare them silently down. Anger and rashness will coil around our hearts, but we shall remain unmoved. As long as the plains remain, the buffalo shall roam in peace, as we were meant to, and even if time one day has ground us down, it will not have broken us! We are Buffalo, and we will remain Buffalo!""
bufstate.19.a:0 "Peace in our time!"
bufstate.20.t:0 "The Tribes Must Come Together"
bufstate.20.d:0 "For our people to survive and for our nation to thrive we must stop with the tribal hostilities and cease our trivial hatred of our own brethren! Why must we hate each other so when our differences are small and our similarities are great? We all have two horns on our head and enough fluff on us to make a bed! So enough with the anger and hate, we must come together for the sake of all our children and their children. To come together as one society under one leader which will not decide itself upon which side of the steppe you were born on. \n\nFor as a wise mare once told me, friendship is magic. And i want us all to share that magic with each other."
bufstate.20.a:0 "Why can't we be friends?"
bufstate.21.t:0 "The Murder Of Our Own"
bufstate.21.d:0 "On this day three years ago it happened, the greatest travesty to befall the Buffalo in decades. Two young Buffalo barely more than Calfs were sitting and having shakes at the Happy Cow when a Pony oil worker came into the establishment. He pulled out a weapon and shot the two poor calfs till they were dead, ending them for their supposed crime of their Buffalo race and bodies. He was a Stallion of anger rage and spite, hating all of us with venom for saliva and fangs for teeth. \n\nAnd here we sit upon the graves of these two poor young Calfs of our flock who have been lost, and i will promise one thing and if that is the last thing i promise it will be my greatest promise. And that is that what happened to these two Calfs will not happen to any of our Calfs ever again. They will not be whisked away to see trial in a Pony court for crimes commited on Buffalo soil. There will be no Pony jury judge nor princess. The Chiefs will deal with these monsters the only way that is proper. \n\nWe will give back to anyone that dares to hurt us a pain a thousand times worse than what they commited on us, there will be a reckoning that strikes all that try to wound us. Now, lets have a silent minute for the fallen."
bufstate.21.a:0 "..."
bufstate.22.t:0 "Neutrality In The Constitution"
bufstate.22.d:0 "A momentous day appears as the Great Chief Thunderhoof has signed into the Chiefdom constitution, the Great Peace act of 1007. This act will ensure that for as long as the Buffalo Chiefdoms exist as an entity it will not declare war on any sovereign nation nor entity. That it will not enter into hostilities with nor support any nation within its wars or its troubles, that it will act neutral in any and all conflicts and make sure it stays out of them in all ways except for as a mediator between two parties. \n\nThis however does not mean the Buffalo will not have an army, nor that it will not defend itself in the case of a hostile army coming to take down the Buffalo and wipe them off the map. It only means that they will not start the war, but that they will surely end it."
bufstate.22.a:0 "The eternal peace shall indeed be eternal."

bufstate.3.t:0 "Greyhorn"
bufstate.3.d:0 "I am the Great Elder Greyhorn, i have been alive for as long as all the Buffalo alive can remember and even before that, i have seen the Buffalo go from a great nation of strength and purity to one riddled with the disease that is the Harmonist ideology. With race traitors like Farwander running to become the next Great Chief though she has not lived here since she was a Calf, she has not seen the life the Buffalo lead and the poverty sadness and despair that runs through them. The ponies act above us, they act as if we are some backwater trash tribe they keep alive out of kindness when in reality, in their heart of hearts they fear us.\n\nFor even the dumbest pony understands the latent power of the great Buffalo race, and it is time that my people seize that power as their own. To become what we once were, to reclaim our Empire and to make the whole world understand the great might of the Buffalo. I am no coward, i am no suck-up Harmonist nor a craven Neutralist. I am a Nationalist. And i will make this nation's dreams come true."
bufstate.3.a:0 "The Buffalo must rise up!"
bufstate.24.t:0 "Smearing The Opposition"
bufstate.24.d:0 "As the two weaklings bicker over where to place their propaganda, it is easy to see that they have missed the true way to convince others to your side and that is through your ideas and what type of Bull you are. But to be a true leader i must tell my children what the other candidates truly want, what they truly are for. And so many of my flock have begun to tear down the false propaganda and posters, to paint them over and to burn them in great piles. But myself, for now i am only telling the flock what they needed to hear. \n\nAnd that is that Thunderhoof and Farwander are nothing but shams, shams liars thieves and traitors to our people that will do nothing but ruin everything that our people stand for and everything that we have done. That trade away our traditions, culture and tribes to suckle on the teat of Pony technology and technological might. But i am no Calf and neither are my supporters. It is time for our flock to grow up and learn the value of hard work. To learn the value of making things yourself instead of getting everything handed too you by others."
bufstate.24.a:0 "Farwander and Thunderhoof are just big Calfs."
bufstate.25.t:0 "Tales Of Old"
bufstate.25.d:0 "As the regaling prepares to begin the Buffalo all sit around closely to the Great Elder as he smokes his long tobacco pipe and looks into the flames of the bonfire, the only light in the dark winter night. At the beginning he did not speak but as he took another puff he closed his eyes for a moment before releasing a deep breath. Looking up from the flames around him, the old Buffalo did not stir, only taking another breath from his pipe before releasing his breath once more, releasing smoke that turned to the shape of a large black crow.\n\n"My flock, you all know the tale of the Rainbow crow do you not?" He said as he looked at the many young Buffalo who had gathered here tonight, almost all of them nodding gently in fear of not offending the Great Elder. As old as he was the last time a Buffalo challenged The Elder they did not live to do it again.\n\nThe Elder looked into the flames once more as he began to speak. "But few of you have heard the tale of Malsumis the Strong, for it is not a story the weak Buffalo would tell you. The great Warrior god Malsumis was the most powerful of all the gods, a great being of pure power and strength. And he worked with us, for we were the most powerful mortal race while he was the most powerful immortal being. We conquered land after land with his help, destroying our enemies wherever they were and taking all that we ever wanted. All he asked was that we stay strong, and for us to feed his hunger. A deal fairer than any we had before." The young Buffalo stared in awe as they imagined the great warrior god, though one piped up. \n\n"But, Great Elder. If he was so powerful and gave us might, where has he gone?" And so Greyhorn the elder responded. "The pony princesses and the other gods rose up, seeing that he was better and stronger than all the rest of them. Using their twisted magic's and having that defiant Starswirl on their side they banished Malsumis to another dimension, taking our lands away from us that we rightfully conquered using their dirty tricks. So learn from this tale, never for your whole lives trust a pony. For they will do nothing but betray that trust.""
bufstate.25.a:0 "Damn those pony weaklings."
bufstate.26.t:0 "The Weak Fear The Mighty"
bufstate.26.d:0 "The natural order is one where the mighty rise to the top as the cream of the crop, while the weak flounder at the bottom of the chain as they cannot compete with the strength and purity of the strong. And the weakest race of all is the pony race, their only power coming from their magic abilities. A cheap trick of a power that stands no chance against the real magic of the tribes, of the great strength of our bodies. Their tiny puny weaklings in the face of the great Buffalo race! There will be no Equestrian empire for much longer, it does not matter if it is the night or sun but we will destroy the Ponies no matter the cost. \n\nThough what will the cost even be? Not more than a dozen of us, the ponies cannot fight back against us well enough to do any proper damage. The Ponies can use all the technology and guns they want, but we have our hoofs and pies. And that is enough to destroy them all."
bufstate.26.a:0 "May the strongest win."
bufstate.27.t:0 "Bullying The Opposition"
bufstate.27.d:0 "As the opposition tries to recover from the tough position and truth that Greyhorn told the Buffalo populace they try to strike back only for Greyhorn to put them back in their place, brawls begin to happen between the different political groups, fuelled by Greyhorn's aggressive rhetoric the groups fight in the streets with injuries and deaths becoming common as the Greyhorn factions go out on the streets and search for any supporters of Farwander and Thunderhoof spreading any propaganda and swiftly beating them to a pulp and ripping their posters. Spitting in their faces and calling them weak. \n\nSometimes one would have people speaking at small lakes, having a picnic before one utters a word of insult to the Great Elder and soon the Elder's Flock would come out of the woodworks and beat the weaklings, taking their things and throwing them into the water. Many Buffalo began to fear speaking about politics in public, liking to keep their ribs where they were."
bufstate.27.a:0 "How about we break those ribs anyway for good measure?"
bufstate.28.t:0 "How The Mighty Have Fallen"
bufstate.28.d:0 "The great Buffalo empire once stretched from the Coast of sorrow all the way to the Carrottops, a proper empire that was the pride of all the Buffalo tribes within it. A golden age of the Buffalo that we have failed to reach ever since then, for once the pony Princesses arrived everything began to go downhill. It began to all fall apart as they slowly stole our lands away from us, having stolen our mighty god Malsumis from us and outbreeding us in our own lands. They abused the kindness that we had in allowing them to live within Buffalo territory to then steal that territory for the pony race. \n\nIt was a mistake to ever show the ponies kindness, a mistake to ever try and have a camraderie with them and a mistake to ever have tried peace with them. The only language they have learned to respond to is force and so we will speak their language and teach them a lesson they will never forget."
bufstate.28.a:0 "Damn those ponies!"
bufstate.29.t:0 "The Strong Take Their Place"
bufstate.29.d:0 "Greyhorn looked around at the gathered buffalo. All in the same place, and all with the same distinct mark standing in a circle. He stood and walked to the podium, with his personal guards making sure that no one of the wrong kind of Buffalo came near. \n\n“Buffalo, hear me. I say this to all that want to make us, our people strong in the world, something else than our little place here. We deserve better than this. But there are Buffalo amongst us that seek not to make us great, but rather to destroy us from within. \n\nBut I know that in my heart that we can overcome this. Those that seek to destroy us from within are weak. And the weak die. Like it should be. The smart shall rule over others so that all benefit. The strong command so that they may be an example. The fast work so that all can enjoy. And the weak, that are not fit, die.”"
bufstate.29.a:0 "As it should be."
bufstate.30.t:0 "The Night Of Long Horns"
bufstate.30.d:0 "As a tired guard entered Greyhorn's tent he saw that the Great Elder was ready for him, seemingly knowing why he was there and with anger on his face as to why he had not finished his job yet. "Forgive me Great Elder but-" The Elder interrupted him "They still resist don't they? Then shush Stronghoof, you know what must be done. You know that we must end our enemies once and for all tonight. Now go, leave and do not come back untill you have ended all our enemies." Stronghoof nodded, leaving the Elder's tent and galloping to his men and telling them of what must be done that night. \n\nAnd so it began, groups of Buffalo all wandered the streets of the villages, holding torches and searching for their enemies. They knew where the enemies lived and as the moon struck midnight doors began to be smashed down, the Buffalo entering and painting the homes red before leaving them. Ending as many of their political enemies as was possible within the night, the streets having long trials of blood as the Guard's walked with dirty hooves throughout the streets. Their message clear.\n\nYou're either with us, or your dead."

bufstate.31.t:0 "And How They Can Rise Again"
bufstate.31.d:0 "We may have lost our empire but we will get it back, the Buffalo will band together and take back what's theirs. Rebuilding the empire that was lost so long ago, taking back all that the Ponies have taken from us. Destroying the weak ponies and fighting for what's right. The world will know that the Buffalo are mighty, and they will fear the Buffalo knowing that if they do not beg and plead they will be next. That if they do not seek retribution for all that they have done against us they wil be next. \n\nFear us world, for you are weak, while we are mighty."

They came like the storm, thousands upon thousands, and they moved like a tidal wave, relentless and furious. For miles they had run and for miles they would keep running. They were Buffalo, they knew no fear and they knew no exhaustion, their strength was unmatched and their fury limitless. The Earth Mother herself writhed under their hooves and all who came in their way would be crushed.\n\nAt their front was greyhorn, greater and more terrible in fury and strength than any buffalo among him. His horde followed him like an extension of him, no matter how he turned or ran. He seemed akin to the head of an enormous beast at the front of this horde, with eyes that shone with fury and determination to sweep all before it."
bufstate.32.a:0 "Run, run like the wind."
bufstate.33.t:0 "We Shall Be Weak No Longer"
bufstate.33.d:0 "The Buffalo will be strong, the Buffalo will be mighty. We will take what is ours and be proud in what we are, be proud in our strength and find pride in our very being. We will take back what was lost, we will be reborn in the crucible of empire and fight to the last against the disgusting pony race, Celestia and Luna should begin to pray for salvation for they will not find it within Greyhorn's plan.\n\nThe Buffalo chiefdoms will change into an empire, and once this farce of an election is over it will be time to change this society from the bottom to the top. Reborn into Greyhorn's vision for the future. A great inferno is brewing, and it will lash out soon. "
