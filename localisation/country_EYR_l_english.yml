eyrie.1.t:0 "A Brief Recollection Of Events"
eyrie.1.d:0 "I am Iovinus, heir to the Verenian legacy and patriarch of the noble house Eyrie, who have ruled these lands for centuries. For many years, I have been locked in a dynastic dispute with my irresponsible younger half-sibling Vincent. How I loathe his irrational, thoughtless behaviour. It was I who should have succeeded to rulership after the horrid republican uprising, which left many family members dead, but he would not concede to the fact that it is house Erie that is subservient to house Eyrie.\n\nNow, there's been little peace, and even less respite. I watched many young and promising griffons march to the riverfront, only to learn that they've perished. It is their duty to serve their liege lord, yes, but I do not wish to throw lives away. None of this should have happened. Lady Katrina, she helped with her surprising defection, but remains a mystery with her intentions. She will have to see reason in the end, as well. It is my Gods given right to rule Verenia, and restore her splendour to how it was.\n\nEven less fortunately, the commonfolk despises us, and I cannot blame them. Forced in a struggle they have little sympathy or understanding for, living in fear and uncertainty. I promised to myself to restore their well-being, but for now they must give their all. However, I can count on a few but reliable assortment of griffons in my quest, the most prominent among them being my newly minted commander of the Ducal Guard, Roman. His family carries little prestige, but I see great potential in him. There is also my dear Freya, a graduate from Yale whose economical knowledge carried the day many times, and the inscrutable prelate of Eyr, Verena. She is not on my payroll, and quite frightening, but helps keep the peasants in line a little longer. Funny how they fear the divine more than us.\nThis story has been dragged on for too long. How will it end? Nobody but the Gods know, and they don't talk."
