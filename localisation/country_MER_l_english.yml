######################
MER_economic_reform_hearings:0 "Economic Revitalization Hearings"
MER_economic_reform_hearings_desc:0 "Be it Saddle Arabian nobles or Aquileian royalty, Equestrian visitors or zebra wanderers, everycreature has fondly spoken of our little islands and their natural beauty. Very few would say, however, that the Méridiennes are economically viable. Something must be done to reverse this trend, to give our home a niche of its own."
MER_reduce_economic_reliance:0 "Pursue Economic Autonomy"
MER_reduce_economic_reliance_desc:0 "Production of goods and material is sparse and underdeveloped: most is made to satisfy the local needs, while anything luxurious is imported from the Aquileian mainland and our other trading partners. While we cannot expect the Méridiennes to entirely self sufficient, improving the quality of products and expanding existing factories would go a long way towards reversing the downward trend."
MER_develop_second_port:0 "Develop Cocoyer"
MER_develop_second_port_desc:0 "Port Giselda is where all the rustic splendour of the Méridiennes can be fully appreciated. Our culture, our historical landmarks, the bustling docks full of goods and creatures from around the world! However, it is unwise to put all of our eggs in one basket, as the pony expression goes. Promoting the development of Cocoyer would encourage immigration towards the lesser appreciated southern islands."
MER_diversify_exports:0 "Diversify Our Exports"
MER_diversify_exports_desc:0 "What little is shipped abroad can be summed up in two items: rubber and exotic fruit, sold for a pittance. We simply cannot compete with larger and more established nations, who not only export more, but better quality goods too. The first step towards breaking this mold is the expansion of an iron deposit in Cocoyer. It can be refined into steel, a decently valued commodity."
MER_fight_stagnation:0 "Prevent A Recession"
MER_fight_stagnation_desc:0 "The economic situation is slowly becoming untenable. With less and less labour available for locals, there is a growing number of creatures that is able to work, but there is simply no room for them. Idle thoughts lead to either emigration or dangerous sentiments. It cannot be fixed over a day, but large scale (for our size) public projects should temporarily alleviate the problem."
MER_harmonist_solution:0 "The Progressive Method"
MER_harmonist_solution_desc:0 "What connects the few settlements on our islands is mostly dirt trails, with a few cobblestone roads dating to ages past. The automobile has yet to make a large breakthrough, mostly seen as a strange frivolity from the mainland. But the march of progress cannot be avoided, and the civil engineers affilated with PKM and PPH have presented a plan that would correct our lack of infrastructure."
MER_traditionalist_solution:0 "The Traditionalists' Argument"
MER_traditionalist_solution_desc:0 "What connects the few settlements on our islands is mostly dirt trails, with a few cobblestone roads dating to ages past. The local cream of the crop wishes to see development similar to the norm of great cities like Vyzima, Aquila or Pelis. To achieve that, certain ideas like labour laws or fair payment should be put aside in the pursuit of progress."
MER_education_reforms:0 "Renovate the University"
MER_education_reforms_desc:0 "The University of Port Giselda, established over a century ago, has never been particularly notable in the quality of its lessons, or the amount of options available for enterprising students. As innovation comes from our best and brightest, we should invest in this institution, bring over more teachers from the mainland. Surely, the expansion of the intellectual group should be one of our priorities."
MER_negotiate_subsidies:0 "Subsidise Key Industries"
MER_negotiate_subsidies_desc:0 "The Méridiennes' economic activity is divided between the fishing sector, rubber plantation owners, small scale tourist attractions and the meagre local production. None of them can be called reasonably successful, barely managing to stay afloat for various reasons. State intervention could and should lead to an economic growth, increasing our revenue and job opportunities for locals."
MER_encourage_intellectuals:0 "Encourage Higher Learning"
MER_encourage_intellectuals_desc:0 "According to recent census results, we've found that only a small minority of our population actively pursues intellectual careers. The stereotype of an islander interested in scarcely more than having a leisurely time could not be stronger, apparently. This minority only accounts for around 1% of our population. Increasing this percetage to 4 would be optimal, and we have ideas how to achieve that."
MER_stable_growth:0 "Stable Growth Achieved"
MER_stable_growth_desc:0 "Fair winds are blowing on our fair isles in recent times. Although the Méridiennes are far from achieving any sort of prosperity, a potential crisis has been averted, and it should be smooth sailing from now on. Perhaps, once the mainlanders hear about our recent improvements, they'll approve a higher budget for the colony?"
MER_letter_to_moriset:0 "Correspondence With The King"
MER_letter_to_moriset_desc:0 "It is the biannual occasion in which [MER.GetLeader] writes an official report to our Aquileian masters. More often than not, it consists mostly of droll tax reports and unsubtle demands for further funding, which would go relatively unnoticed. But for once, we have some actual good news to present to the King, and there's surely a reward waiting for us loyal subjects."
MER_the_second_revolution:0 "Aquileia In Flames"
MER_the_second_revolution_desc:0 "Disaster! Horror! Outrage! Once again, the mainland is in turmoil as the revolting Republicans have risen up to reinstate their despicable ideology. Even if our islands are far from the troubles, the rats will quickly scurry through the holes and bring disorder. We must convene at once and quickly decide on the next course of action, before the situation grows out of control!"
MER_stay_out_of_it:0 "Keep Out Of It"
MER_stay_out_of_it_desc:0 "Our assessment completed, we've decided that the Méridiennes will have to stay out of the conflict. Our forces are too small, and even if we had considerable amounts of soldiers, we're too far to make it in time. Undoubtedly, exiles will flock to the isles again, and we should instead focus on preserving our independence by fortifying as best as we can."
MER_raise_militias:0 "Raise the Militias"
MER_raise_militias_desc:0 "Formally, the colony does not maintain an official armed force, as it was deemed unnecessary. Piracy has long been rooted out, and the Saddle Arabians have been in decline for decades, before their own revolt happened recently. Instead, the so called "colonial volunteers" have kept order, and they've done their job well. But now we must expand the amount of guards and garrisons, through conscription if needed."
MER_dig_in:0 "Dig In"
MER_dig_in_desc:0 "We've done everything we could to protect our island from the insidious revolutionaries. Any individuals caught making suspicious activities have been apprehended, the expanded police force is having their claws full keeping track of rumours and gossip, and we've raised rudimentary coastal defences. Whatever happens, the Méridiennes will not give up without a fight."
MER_take_action:0 "Take Action"
MER_take_action_desc:0 "As far as we are from the mainland, we cannot just simply lay idly on our laurels while good Aquileians are fighting for what's right. The isles have always been devoted subjects of the Crown, and within each of our hearts (those harbouring dissident thoughts will be prosecuted) is an earnest desire to prove ourselves. We must take a stand, for the King and proud Aquileia!"
MER_indirect_assistance:0 "Send Weapon Shipments"
MER_indirect_assistance_desc:0 "The Méridiennes maintain a miniscule arms industry, intended completely for local purposes of keeping order. We have not seen battles in quite a while, and as a result, a considerable stockpile of admittedly dated firearms has grown over the past years. Instead of rusting in armouries, we should send everything we can spare to our friends at the mainland. Every little bit helps, and we must prove ourselves."
MER_send_help:0 "Send Volunteers"
MER_send_help_desc:0 "The blood of the patriots calls to action! Many creatures have demanded recently to be sent to battle, and their number has grown to a worrying amount. If we do not approve their requests, they could very well incite riots with their behaviour. Thus it is settled: anycreature willing to die for King and Aquileia will be given passage to the mainland, with enough gear to sustain themselves in combat."

While this has its benefits and has helped to foster healthy trade relations with the Crown, we have little ability to produce any refined goods domestically. As a result, local production has stagnated and unemployment is rising, owing to an uncompetitive economy.
