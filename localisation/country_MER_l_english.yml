MER_economic_reform_hearings:0 "Economic Revitalization Hearings"
MER_economic_reform_hearings_desc:0 "Be it Saddle Arabian nobles or Aquileian royalty, Equestrian visitors or zebra wanderers, everycreature has fondly spoken of our little islands and their natural beauty. Very few would say, however, that the Méridiennes are economically viable. Something must be done to reverse this trend, to give our home a niche of its own."
MER_reduce_economic_reliance:0 "Pursue Economic Autonomy"
MER_reduce_economic_reliance_desc:0 "Production of goods and material is sparse and underdeveloped: most is made to satisfy the local needs, while anything luxurious is imported from the Aquileian mainland and our other trading partners. While we cannot expect the Méridiennes to entirely self sufficient, improving the quality of products and expanding existing factories would go a long way towards reversing the downward trend."
MER_develop_second_port:0 "Develop Cocoyer"
MER_develop_second_port_desc:0 "Port Giselda is where all the rustic splendour of the Méridiennes can be fully appreciated. Our culture, our historical landmarks, the bustling docks full of goods and creatures from around the world! However, it is unwise to put all of our eggs in one basket, as the pony expression goes. Promoting the development of Cocoyer would encourage immigration towards the lesser appreciated southern islands."
MER_diversify_exports:0 "Diversify Our Exports"
MER_diversify_exports_desc:0 "What little is shipped abroad can be summed up in two items: rubber and exotic fruit, sold for a pittance. We simply cannot compete with larger and more established nations, who not only export more, but better quality goods too. The first step towards breaking this mold is the expansion of an iron deposit in Cocoyer. It can be refined into steel, a decently valued commodity."
MER_fight_stagnation:0 "Prevent A Recession"
MER_fight_stagnation_desc:0 "The economic situation is slowly becoming untenable. With less and less labour available for locals, there is a growing number of creatures that is able to work, but there is simply no room for them. Idle thoughts lead to either emigration or dangerous sentiments. It cannot be fixed over a day, but large scale (for our size) public projects should temporarily alleviate the problem."
MER_harmonist_solution:0 "The Progressive Method"
MER_harmonist_solution_desc:0 "What connects the few settlements on our islands is mostly dirt trails, with a few cobblestone roads dating to ages past. The automobile has yet to make a large breakthrough, mostly seen as a strange frivolity from the mainland. But the march of progress cannot be avoided, and the civil engineers affilated with PKM and PPH have presented a plan that would correct our lack of infrastructure."
MER_traditionalist_solution:0 "The Traditionalists' Argument"
MER_traditionalist_solution_desc:0 "What connects the few settlements on our islands is mostly dirt trails, with a few cobblestone roads dating to ages past. The local cream of the crop wishes to see development similar to the norm of great cities like Vyzima, Aquila or Pelis. To achieve that, certain ideas like labour laws or fair payment should be put aside in the pursuit of progress."
MER_education_reforms:0 "Renovate the University"
MER_education_reforms_desc:0 "The University of Port Giselda, established over a century ago, has never been particularly notable in the quality of its lessons, or the amount of options available for enterprising students. As innovation comes from our best and brightest, we should invest in this institution, bring over more teachers from the mainland. Surely, the expansion of the intellectual group should be one of our priorities."
MER_negotiate_subsidies:0 "Subsidise Key Industries"
MER_negotiate_subsidies_desc:0 "The Méridiennes' economic activity is divided between the fishing sector, rubber plantation owners, small scale tourist attractions and the meagre local production. None of them can be called reasonably successful, barely managing to stay afloat for various reasons. State intervention could and should lead to an economic growth, increasing our revenue and job opportunities for locals."
MER_encourage_intellectuals:0 "Encourage Higher Learning"
MER_encourage_intellectuals_desc:0 "According to recent census results, we've found that only a small minority of our population actively pursues intellectual careers. The stereotype of an islander interested in scarcely more than having a leisurely time could not be stronger, apparently. This minority only accounts for around 1% of our population. Increasing this percetage to 4 would be optimal, and we have ideas how to achieve that."
MER_stable_growth:0 "Stable Growth Achieved"
MER_stable_growth_desc:0 "Fair winds are blowing on our fair isles in recent times. Although the Méridiennes are far from achieving any sort of prosperity, a potential crisis has been averted, and it should be smooth sailing from now on. Perhaps, once the mainlanders hear about our recent improvements, they'll approve a higher budget for the colony?"
MER_letter_to_moriset:0 "Correspondence With The King"
MER_letter_to_moriset_desc:0 "It is the biannual occasion in which [MER.GetLeader] writes an official report to our Aquileian masters. More often than not, it consists mostly of droll tax reports and unsubtle demands for further funding, which would go relatively unnoticed. But for once, we have some actual good news to present to the King, and there's surely a reward waiting for us loyal subjects."
MER_the_second_revolution:0 "Aquileia In Flames"
MER_the_second_revolution_desc:0 "Disaster! Horror! Outrage! Once again, the mainland is in turmoil as the revolting Republicans have risen up to reinstate their despicable ideology. Even if our islands are far from the troubles, the rats will quickly scurry through the holes and bring disorder. We must convene at once and quickly decide on the next course of action, before the situation grows out of control!"
MER_stay_out_of_it:0 "Keep Out Of It"
MER_stay_out_of_it_desc:0 "Our assessment completed, we've decided that the Méridiennes will have to stay out of the conflict. Our forces are too small, and even if we had considerable amounts of soldiers, we're too far to make it in time. Undoubtedly, exiles will flock to the isles again, and we should instead focus on preserving our independence by fortifying as best as we can."
MER_raise_militias:0 "Raise the Militias"
MER_raise_militias_desc:0 "Formally, the colony does not maintain an official armed force, as it was deemed unnecessary. Piracy has long been rooted out, and the Saddle Arabians have been in decline for decades, before their own revolt happened recently. Instead, the so called "colonial volunteers" have kept order, and they've done their job well. But now we must expand the amount of guards and garrisons, through conscription if needed."
MER_dig_in:0 "Dig In"
MER_dig_in_desc:0 "We've done everything we could to protect our island from the insidious revolutionaries. Any individuals caught making suspicious activities have been apprehended, the expanded police force is having their claws full keeping track of rumours and gossip, and we've raised rudimentary coastal defences. Whatever happens, the Méridiennes will not give up without a fight."
MER_take_action:0 "Take Action"
MER_take_action_desc:0 "As far as we are from the mainland, we cannot just simply lay idly on our laurels while good Aquileians are fighting for what's right. The isles have always been devoted subjects of the Crown, and within each of our hearts (those harbouring dissident thoughts will be prosecuted) is an earnest desire to prove ourselves. We must take a stand, for the King and proud Aquileia!"
MER_indirect_assistance:0 "Send Weapon Shipments"
MER_indirect_assistance_desc:0 "The Méridiennes maintain a miniscule arms industry, intended completely for local purposes of keeping order. We have not seen battles in quite a while, and as a result, a considerable stockpile of admittedly dated firearms has grown over the past years. Instead of rusting in armouries, we should send everything we can spare to our friends at the mainland. Every little bit helps, and we must prove ourselves."
MER_send_help:0 "Send Volunteers"
MER_send_help_desc:0 "The blood of the patriots calls to action! Many creatures have demanded recently to be sent to battle, and their number has grown to a worrying amount. If we do not approve their requests, they could very well incite riots with their behaviour. Thus it is settled: anycreature willing to die for King and Aquileia will be given passage to the mainland, with enough gear to sustain themselves in combat."
MER_wait_it_out:0 "With Bated Breaths, We Watched"
MER_wait_it_out_desc:0 ""We've done all that we could, distant as we are, leaving us only to wait and listen for any news from the mainland. Information will take days to arrive, but I will pray for the King's success in combating these filthy insurgents. Aquileia has the Discrets; she needs no 'president' or 'republic'.""

###########################
### Loyalist Focus Tree ###
###########################

MER_steady_as_she_goes:0 "Steady As She Goes"
MER_steady_as_she_goes_desc:0 "As expected, the filthy Republican rabble has been crushed and prevented from restoring their most ignoble ideals. The populace is content knowing that further insecurities will not plague our fair islands, but much work remains to be done in the service for the Crown."

################
### Military ###
################

MER_reform_colonial_military:0 "Reform the Colonial Military"
MER_reform_colonial_military_desc:0 "For many years, the islands of Méridiennes have maintained what could be quaintly called, an informal militia. There was never a need for any sort of military development, owing to the protection from the mainland. But now we live in troubled times, where certainties are breaking down. With the surplus raised from the economical reform, we can invest into restructuring our armed forces."
MER_fighter_research:0 "Beginnings of an Airforce"
MER_fighter_research_desc:0 "Although far from large landmasses, the position of our islands has a certain benefit, according to some radical thinkers. As airplanes are becoming more and more prominent in conflicts, they could be utilised to effectively protect our home. What good is the greatest fleet in the world, if it can't reach its destination? We must look into acquiring this knowledge for our benefit."
MER_prioritize_range:0 "Prioritize Long-Range Air Operations"
MER_prioritize_range_desc:0 "The imported airplanes have proven their worth, and the pilots have successfully completed various trial runs. However, the range of these machines is insufficient for any sort of wider operations, that aren't confined to our homelands. Our future designs will have to made in mind to minimise this drawback: grant them a further reach, cut down on the unnecessary excess."
MER_torpedo_bomber_primacy:0 "Torpedo Bomber Primacy"
MER_torpedo_bomber_primacy_desc:0 "It would seem that the wind is blowing in an unfavourable direction for warships these days, not many can successfully resist an aerial attack without support from their own aviation. With that in mind, we've drawn up plans for our first aircraft specialised in striking targets rather than opposing planes - a long range bomber dedicated for naval assaults."
MER_air_doctrine_research:0 "Belle-Île School of Aerial Warfare"
MER_air_doctrine_research_desc:0 "As with any new innovation, the usage of airplanes must be put to a certain standard. To elaborate, it means that they should operate in a combined arms styled approach with the other branches of our armed forces, as well as determining a specialisation of our aerial doctrine. Plans might quickly fall apart, but good planning will carry us a long way."
MER_bomber_research:0 "Bomber Advancements"
MER_bomber_research_desc:0 "The naval bomber project has given satisfying results, and with the lessons learned, we can redesign the chassis to fit a more localised approach for bombing missions. Even though currently the only thing in strike range are remote islands with practice targets for our new pilots, perhaps someday the mainland will require our aid, and the colonial airforce shall be ready to respond."
MER_arms_industry:0 "Jumpstart Our Arms Industry"
MER_arms_industry_desc:0 "If there is anything that's always missing, it would be firearms and supplies. With the planned expansion of the colonial forces, current production is unsatisfying and would not be able to keep up with the demand, especially if a conflict arises. The local economy will be bolstered with the expansion of our factories and workshops, all in service to the good crown of Aquileia."
MER_modernize_infantry_equipment:0 "Infantry Kit Innovations"
MER_modernize_infantry_equipment_desc:0 "Rifle and ammunition, certainly the most basic things any soldier needs. As war becomes ever more deadly, there is an even greater need to stay ahead of our rivals: more accurate weaponry, additional tools for the field and removing obsolete equipment from our armouries. The armed forces will certainly take greater pride in their service, if they possess the best we can give."
MER_CAS_research:0 "Dive Bomber Modernisation"
MER_CAS_research_desc:0 "Bombing is certainly effective in causing untold amounts of devastation, but certain situations require more finesse and restraint. It would do us little good if an aerial strike on the battlefield ends up causing friendly fire, which is why there is a need for a specialised aircraft that can remove such a risk, while remaining effective in achieving objectives."
MER_pridean_officers:0 "Hire Pridean Generals"
MER_pridean_officers_desc:0 "Us proud patriots are not lacking in enthusiasm when it comes to serving the Aquileian crown, but we cannot do everything on our own. The remoteness of these isles means there are few who can call themselves veterans or innovators in military matters, thus arises a need to acquire the services of such individuals from the mainland. Quality cooperation is sure to follow."
MER_infantry_equipment_standardization:0 "Standardise Infantry Equipment Designs"
MER_infantry_equipment_standardization_desc:0 "Centuries of industrial progress has taught the world a simple fact: uniformity in the parts of any machine means that it can be assembled easily. By making identical parts within a fine tolerance, identical machines can be built from any mixture of those parts. Particularly useful for the military, cutting down on repair costs for almost any equipment."
MER_marine_capabilities:0 "Elite Hippogriff Marines"
MER_marine_capabilities_desc:0 "Out of many races that dot this world, the hippogriffs are rightfully considered to be more adept when it comes to handling water. Given our position, amphibious assaults are certainly going to be required at some point, thus it pays to be prepared for the possibility. The colonial marines shall be a point of pride for the nation, whatever race they may be."
MER_artillery_modernization:0 "Revamped Ordinance Designs"
MER_artillery_modernization_desc:0 "Artillery has been a mainstay of any ground force ever since its inception, and the primary way to counter an opposing force is with our own. Numbers, however, aren't the solution for everything. Efficiency is the key, such as improved training for artillery crews, advanced percussion shells, or even hydraulic recoil mechanisms that greatly improve accuracy."
MER_support_companies:0 "Support Company Proliferation"
MER_support_companies_desc:0 "Combat has evolved a long time ago from the heroics of a single warrior, it is now a dedicated team effort. Each works on their own in achieving their objective, but as a part of a whole, larger operation. To this end, support companies are required: soldiers to handle bridge building, supply transport, taking care of the wounded, and more. Without support, even the greatest force will fail."
MER_naval_industry_expansion:0 "Expand Our Naval Industry"
MER_naval_industry_expansion_desc:0 "The Méridiennes have always had a plentitude of dockyards, ports, wharves, fisheries and other aspects of naval production, but recent developments have led us to assume that the current industry is insufficient for building more advanced vessels. The locals will bemoan the devastation of shores and beaches, but this is more important than aesthetics."
MER_submarine_advancements:0 "Wolfpack Advancements"
MER_submarine_advancements_desc:0 "It would be foolhardy to assume we could build even one battleship or similar warship in time for a conflict, not to mention it would probably become obsolete on completion. Thus it seems natural to specialise in submarines, to harry and waylay merchant convoys, and other undefended ships. More importantly, they can be assembled far quicker, making losses manageable."
MER_invasion_transports:0 "Improved Transport Designs"
MER_invasion_transports_desc:0 "Warships can be temporarily given the order to transport soldiers, but their cramped space makes difficult to move a large quantity, or across a longer time period. What is needed are dedicated vessels for the job, alongside landing barges that will assist in assaulting coasts and shores."
MER_moar_dockyard_expansion:0 "Shipyard Work Quotas"
MER_moar_dockyard_expansion_desc:0 "Although the naval industry has substantionally grown in recent times, production still remains at unsatisfying levels. We have little choice but to push directives for increasing productivity, first through promises of rewards, later by enforcing punishments should deadlines be ignored. All for the good of the nation, of course."
MER_destroyer_advancements:0 "Anti-Submarine Efforts"
MER_destroyer_advancements_desc:0 "The island nation relies heavily on imports from abroad, lest crucial materials run into a shortage when it is most needed. To patrol the coasts of Méridiennes, and report on any suspicious activities from would-be raiders, destroyers are needed to fulfil that role. Cheap, adaptable and quick, much roles can be satisfied with their presence."
MER_cruiser_advancements:0 "Workhorse Theorem"
MER_cruiser_advancements_desc:0 "Owing to our restricted naval industry, the largest warships that can be feasibly built belong to the cruiser class. Sturdy and armed to withstand devastating battles, yet quick enough to act as an escort for more vulnerable vessels. It is certain that the locals will be awed, once the first is launched from the shipyards."
MER_doctrine_of_support:0 "Small Contribution, Large Impact"
MER_doctrine_of_support_desc:0 "We have never claimed to be on the same level as any province on the mainland, but our dedicated support shall not go unnoticed in Aquila. By setting aside resources and equipment for our overlord, we shall prove ourselves worthy of the Crown's favour, while maintaining a certain level of autonomy for ourselves."

### Loyalist Economy ###
########################
MER_continue_the_reforms:0 "Finish The Reforms"
MER_continue_the_reforms_desc:0 "The colonial administration has done an excellent job preventing the islands from falling into an economic slump, much like the majority of Griffonia in recent times. There are a few token improvements left to carry out to maintain a stable growth, so let's not rest and call it a done deal just yet."
MER_civ_industry:0 "Expand Domestic Industrial Sectors"
MER_civ_industry_desc:0 "The simple basics of any economic thought: growth and profit pave the way for further growth and profit. As the populace is slowly gaining wealthier, they're buying more products, giving producers a return on their investment and more. A further development in our industries for the production of everything a creature might need in their daily life is in order."
MER_more_development_projects:0 "Additional Development Projects"
MER_more_development_projects_desc:0 "There are many deals, designs, enterprises or plans the government can pursue, but as always, there are not enough funds or resources for everything. Establishing a formal procedure for economic proposals, which the colonial administration can then review and decide on its viability should ensure that only the most serious motions reach the end."
MER_society_development_modernized:0 "Le Parc Industriel De Port Giselda"
MER_society_development_modernized_desc:0 "Centralisation and consolidation of industry can only serve towards increasing efficiency and productivity. Port Giselda is already home to a majority of the Méridiennes' economic activity, but there is always room for additional improvement. Setting aside an area dedicated for industrialisation, away from urban centres, shall further our endeavours."
MER_expand_giselda_university:0 "Expand Campus Grounds"
MER_expand_giselda_university_desc:0 "With the recent expansion of the Port Giselda University, interest has raised to a degree where we simply cannot accomodate any more students near the area! It would seem that good news travel far, and while we certainly won't end up in an Equestrian newspaper detailing on best education facilities, we can still increase the budget for our brighter future."
MER_electronics_research:0 "Electronical Ingenuity"
MER_electronics_research_desc:0 "The guiding trend for technology these days is that it is growing ever more efficient, yet compact and smaller. Such is the case especially in the field of electronics, where a claw sized contraption can guide the actions of a machine that is far larger in size. Further development in this area could lead to a breakthrough in emerging fields of science."
MER_fuel_industry:0 "The Les Abondantes Fuel Refinery"
MER_fuel_industry_desc:0 "An island chain like ours needs fuel to avoid becoming isolated from the wider world, as transportation grinds to a halt because there's simply none of it left. Although oil remains at somewhat affordable prices for the time being, it will certainly increase as demand picks up globally, and we should establish a certain amount of self-sufficiency in this regard."
MER_summer_islands_purchase:0 "Purchase The Summer Islands"
MER_summer_islands_purchase_desc:0 "To the northwest lie the Summer Islands, named such for their particular charm during the warm season. Although they've never been officially a part of the Méridiennes, they are culturally similar enough to us, not to mention less than three day's distance by ship. Surely, their owners would be interested in an mutually amicable exchange?"
MER_more_domestic_companies:0 "Further Investments In Domestic Industry"
MER_more_domestic_companies_desc:0 "Business is booming, as the saying goes, but not everycreature is destined to achieve success in their ventures. The government can mitigate these failures to some degree, by offering subsidies, publish advice regarding corporation laws, provide efficient advertising and more. We simply expect a small return on our investments, however."
MER_invite_aquileian_companies:0 "Invite More Mainland Companies"
MER_invite_aquileian_companies_desc:0 "There are few things corporations enjoy, but one of them are low operation costs. We cannot do everything on our own, local businesses cannot satisfy the needs of the state. Thus, by offering mainland companies several benefits in exchange for opening a branch on the isles, we can gain their expertise and knowledge for little investment."
MER_resource_prospects:0 "Resource Prospects"
MER_resource_prospects_desc:0 "The Méridiennes can't be called large islands by any means, but much of the interior remains both sparsely populated and explored in terms of resource exploitation. This was primarily because of the expenses involved, but now that technology has reduced these costs to an appreciable degree, we can attempt to find out if anything valuable lies beneath the ground."
MER_machine_tools_research:0 "Industrial R&D Grants"
MER_machine_tools_research_desc:0 "Problems require a solution, and that's where innovation shines brightest, especially when enticed with a generous reward. If we were to collect and list the most common woes the industrial sector is facing, those with the drive and ideas to offer improvements will certainly follow suit."
MER_eradicate_poverty:0 "Eradicate Poverty"
MER_eradicate_poverty_desc:0 "Despite our efforts, there are still a few places where the standard of living is unacceptably low. Idleness and lack of money drive creatures to undesirable thoughts, after all. By hiring unemployed locals to do government-sponsored light infrastructure projects, paid for by taxing the businesses which later arrive to take advantage of it, we can solve even that."
MER_improved_inter_island_shipping:0 "Improved Inter-Island Shipping Routes"
MER_improved_inter_island_shipping_desc:0 "As development increases, so does the need to transport resources and creatures between our islands, and even beyond them. However, the civilian transportation sector is not what could be called efficient by any means, both in scheduling and the quality of their vessels. Alleviating these hindrances should help tremendously for the local economy."
MER_tourism_industry:0 "Makings Of A Tourist Economy"
MER_tourism_industry_desc:0 "With most of the local problems solved or in the process of such, we can now turn our sights to exploiting the islands' most appealing quality. Namely, the development of a sector based around attracting creatures from around the world to come here and spend their money! It can certainly be more profitable than any traditional industry we might establish here."
MER_hemp_industry:0 "Develop Industrial-Grade Hemp"
MER_hemp_industry_desc:0 ""Whatever your misgivings about this 'weed' are, there are no doubts that it is quite practical. Paper, food, textiles, or even personal enjoyment, I've heard, hemp can be utilised far more effectively than just letting it rot!"\n\n- Trot Barley, Minister of Agriculture"
MER_plantations:0 "Subsidise the Plantations"
MER_plantations_desc:0 "From crops to rubber, the island plantations provide a great deal of resources that can be further refined in the production process. They haven't quite kept up with the times, with many reporting very low profit margins or worse. To prevent a source of labour from going under, we shall give a little push to ensure they stay competitive in this day and age, for the good of the state."
MER_pleasure_colony:0 "The Crown Jewel"
MER_pleasure_colony_desc:0 "We've been through turbulent times, and we've invested a great deal of effort, but the Méridiennes of today can hardly be compared to those from a decade ago. Modern infrastructure, industry and education have been successfully laid down, and now we reap the benefits of our success. Whoever decides to visit our little corner of the world, will leave greatly impressed."
