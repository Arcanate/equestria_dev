### Ideas ###

MER_semblance_of_democracy:0 "Semblance of Democracy"
MER_semblance_of_democracy_desc:0 "#TODO The Colony of Les Meridiennes is an oddity within the Kingdom of Aquileia. Having avoided the bloodshed of the First Revolution, it had been seen as free from the stain of Republicanism and had likewise been spared from King Moriset's resultant cleansing. Seeing as how the King, as well as many within the colonial administration, are apparently satisfied with this outcome, it is unlikely that this will change very soon."
MER_semblance_of_democracy_2:0 "Semblance of Democracy"
MER_semblance_of_democracy_2_desc:0 "#TODO The Colony of Les Meridiennes is an oddity within the Kingdom of Aquileia.

MER_reliance_on_jerkass:0 "Reliance on Aquileian Imports"
MER_reliance_on_jerkass_desc:0 "#TODO we rely on Aquileian products for much of our local economy. While this has its benefits and has helped to foster healthy trade relations with the Crown, we have little ability to produce any refined goods domestically. If we ever want to truly prosper, this must change."
MER_reliance_on_jerkass_2:0 "Reliance on Aquileian Imports"

Genevive, being the absolute sweetheart that she is, will be presented with the choice of simply thanking them publicly, which will raise the support of all parties equally, or sending secretaries out with office coolers and paper cups to make sure they stay H Y D R A T E D."
