### Starting Tree ###
 
TBK_art_of_the_deal: "The Art of the Deal"
TBK_art_of_the_deal_desc: "Some ponies would consider the finest art to be the graceful brushstrokes that inhabit a painter's canvas, or maybe the soothing harmonies that fill the walls of a concert hall with on performance night; but for arms dealers Pea Shooter and Vasile Cel Tradat, there is no greater art in the world than the art of the deal."
 
TBK_facade_of_democracy: "The Facade of Democracy"
TBK_facade_of_democracy_desc: "It's an open secret in Tobuck that the government and its stated "democracy" are just an elaborate sham to garner support from nations like Maregypt, when in reality much of the country is governed by authoritarian warlords, and democratically elected officials have little power."
 
TBK_grease_the_wheel: "Greasing the Wheel of Democracy"
TBK_grease_the_wheel_desc: "Even though the elected government holds little power, simply subverting them by use of force would be inexcusable in both the eyes of the people and friendly regimes; as such it sometimes requires a little bit of bribery and blackmail to convince government bureaucrats to sign off on risky legislature, and smile while doing it."

TBK_convincing_legislature: "Pass the Home Act"
TBK_convincing_legislature_desc: "Gives an idea giving bonus to stability and party popularity gain with malus to pp: the republic passes a law that enables free passage between the lands of Tobuck and Zarantia to all citizens, no questions asked."

TBK_expand_republican_guard: "Expand Guard Jurisdiction"
TBK_expand_republican_guard_desc: "Gives an idea giving pp gain bonus and lowers warlord suspicion; Pea forces the republic to pass a bill expanding authority and legal right of the republican guard to control movement within Tobuck. In reality it enables him to control flow of information to the warlords, if only briefly."

TBK_nascent_bureaucracy: "Clean the House"
TBK_nascent_bureaucracy_desc: "Gives flat pp and stability bonus alongside a stack of dirty money; leads to an event where some bureacract wonders about the recent reforms that has seen her workload increased while her boss seems terse, giving to drinking even earlier than usual and without the usual jovialities."

TBK_hope_tobuck: "Three Hurrays For Tobuck"
TBK_hope_tobuck_desc: "TODO"

TBK_meet_giggle_juice: "The Loveable Drunk"
TBK_meet_giggle_juice_desc: "While effectively a puppet, one of the most important ponies in Tobuck's democracy is a pony named Giggle Juice. A drunkard who lacks actual power, but makes up for it with an abundance of charisma; he's a popular figurehead in the eyes of many, and his support is paramount to maintaining the facade of Democracy." 

TBK_parlay_vasile: "Erstwhile Partner"
TBK_parlay_vasile_desc: "Gives an event where Pea sits down with Vasile to discuss life after Tobuck."

TBK_zarantia_peace_speech: "Peace and Prosperity"
TBK_zarantia_peace_speech_desc: "Gives party popularity and stability; Giggle Juice gives a speech written by Vasily about how Tobuck and Zarantia have no qualms and can co-exist, come high or low water. He even invites the queen over for a drink and chat. Could lead to also an event for this speech?"

TBK_early_pay_day: "Their Pay Day"
TBK_early_pay_day_desc: "After thoroughly touching base with everypony that props up our make-believe democracy, it's time for them to reap the benefits of their loyalty. After all, we want it to be pretty clear that allegiance is an investment that pays dividends."

TBK_our_pay_day: "Our Pay Day"
TBK_our_pay_day_desc: "The rules have been set, the sellers regulated and the offshore accounts maintained. We're fit to rake in cash for as long as our supply lasts, come Tatarus or high water."

TBK_thanks_for_bits: "Goodbye, And Thanks For the Bits"
TBK_thanks_for_bits_desc: "Completing this focus will end the Pea Shooter money part early, giving him an additional personal wealth bonus for handing over Tobuck earlier than laid down in the deal."

TBK_pr_campaign: "To The Citizens of Tobuck!"
TBK_pr_campaign_desc: "Stability increase + lowers warlord suspicion; Pea, with help of Giggle, launches a massive pr campaign to calm the populace and soldiers amongst the warlords about the recent reforms."

TBK_please_listen: "Do Not Believe Their Lies!"
TBK_please_listen_desc: "Resets warlord suspicion; the media begins to counter spreading lies and rumours actively, going as far as to defame by name known critics."

TBK_to_each_their_game: "To Each Their Game"
TBK_to_each_their_game_desc: "A free market is good for business, but there is a such thing as it being too free. With a little bookkeeping and regulation we can ensure that only loyal liaisons and captains are shipping our guns around, and that none of them are sold to local warlords that could try to muscle in on the trade."

TBK_checking_the_supply: "Checking the Supply"
TBK_checking_the_supply_desc: "Gives access to a better gun salvaging mission; should be about Pea with his aides calculating and checking the amount of guns remaining based on estimation."

TBK_quality_products: "Quality Products"
TBK_quality_products_desc: "One of the most important things an arms dealer maintains is his reputation. Sell defective arms to a customer one too many times and you may as well consider yourself out of a job. On the other hoof, certain firearms are precisely hunted for their qualities, whenever exceptional or historical. It'd be a waste to sell them off to a common buyer and leave a wealthy patron miffed."

TBK_business_of_gun_running: "The Business of Gun Running"
TBK_business_of_gun_running_desc: "Arms trafficking is the bread and butter of Tobuck. It's why the government was founded, how it's funded, why it's leaders even care, and ultimately the glue that binds Tobuckian society together. On top of all that, it makes us extremely rich!" 

TBK_meeting_the_banker: "Meeting With the Banker"
TBK_meeting_the_banker_desc: "One of the most important part of Tobuck's gun trade is offshore bank accounts; Tobuck is not a state with a stable economy. Storing our accumulated wealth in local banks is just asking for it to be lost with the next financial crisis, which is why it's important to regularly meet with overseas bankers to maintain foreign accounts."
 
TBK_performance_review: "Performance Review"
TBK_performance_review_desc: "With ample use of auditors and statisticians, we can actually get to the business of determining if all of our hard work has actually paid off in the end, or if we've just wasted our time with bad business."

TBK_streamlined_procurement: "Streamlined Procurement"
TBK_streamlined_procurement_desc: "Lowers the timer for the missions at cost of pp; in short, Pea streamlines the arms gathering through reformed catalogue system and expanded workforce."

TBK_eye_on_warlords: "The Three Warlords"
TBK_eye_on_warlords_desc: "Gives some stability and popularity; Pea knows he has to keep the warlords distracted in order for them to not discover the deal with Zarantia. Therefore he must be ready to play ball with them just a little bit longer."

TBK_celebrate_military_success: "Celebrate Military Success"
TBK_celebrate_military_success_desc: "Lowers warlord suspicion; Pea organises shipments of food and drinks to the warlords under the pretext of celebrating their success in defending Tobuck."

TBK_rules_gun_running: "The Rules of Good Business"
TBK_rules_gun_running_desc: "Gives pp and lowers supremacy popularity; just a flavour description detailing how gunrunning has certain rules that any succesfull smuggler ought to follow or they will perish."

TBK_first_rule: "First Rule"
TBK_first_rule_desc: "First rule is to never get shot with your own merchandise. Sell it unloaded, and sell it to people way out of killing range. Wallnut Drive is a true odball compared to the other warlords, someone who seems to find new ways to break guns and expend ammunition."

TBK_tricky_thestral: "The Tricky Thestral"
TBK_tricky_thestral_desc: "TODO"

TBK_second_rule: "Second Rule"
TBK_second_rule_desc: "Second rule is to always ensure you have a foolproof way of getting paid, preferably in advance. If you don't have a guaranteed way to get your cash in the end, the deal isn't worth it. Alesia Snezhnaya is a smart mare and careful with her goods. But give her a good deal and she'll make a good business partner."

TBK_white_severyana: "The White Severyanan"
TBK_white_severyana_desc: "TODO"

TBK_third_rule: "Third Rule"
TBK_third_rule_desc: "Third rule is to never pick up arms with your customers. Baragzen, the snobby Zarantian noble, has far greater ambitions than any other warlord in Tobuck, only outmatched by his boorish smugness. But passion like his, if harnessed well, makes for a good tool."

TBK_exiled_royal: "The Exiled Royal"
TBK_exiled_royal_desc: "TODO"

TBK_failure_operation: "Erstwhile Operation"
TBK_failure_operation_desc: "Lowers warlord suspicion, will damage warlord divisions and lower stability; a skirmish is launched against Chiropterra using warlord units but it naturally ends in failure. Gives Chiropterra an event giving some free labourers?"

TBK_provoke_battles: "Tobuckian Standoff"
TBK_provoke_battles_desc: "Greatly lowers supremacy support; Pea pokes the hornets nest in just the right way to cause a brief threeway battle between the warlords' soldiers, turning their attention elsewhere."

### Events ###

tobuck_start.1.t:0 "The Meeting"
tobuck_start.1.d:0 "Pea Shooter has a meeting with Menes, where he signs a secret deal with Zarantia's Queen to formalize the surrender of Tobuck. In exchange for a set sum of money and amnesty, Pea Shooter and his allies will organise Tobuck to be ready for annexation. The deadline for this is January 1st, 1008, though Pea Shooter assures he can settle everything before it. Though in mind, he knows he will do his best to squeeze last bits from the remaining arms.

tobuck_vasile.1.d:0 "An event where a large-scale news campaign is launched to cast Pea Shooter as the criminal who has allowed Tobuck to suffer. It reveals how he ruled from the shadows as the foreign minister, wielding great influence while taking bribes and dealing with criminals using state assets.

Both sides allure him in different ways, one for its vanities and the other for the riches one could aquire. The car begins to slow and he hears the crowds in the distance, awaiting his speech. He quickly makes his choice, and pens the last line of his speech."

But as the trial concurs, the investigator at charge of the entire case asks the judge to pen a formal request to Equestria to imprison Pea Shooter.

The Storm King brought an end to the promising future of the Kingdom of Zarantia and Tobuck had its fate decided for them by a clique of innovative businesscreatures as they call themselves.

In Tobuck, that’s Giggle Juice, the president of the republic and the funniest drinking buddy Pea Shooter ever met. Despite holding no discernable political view or ambition of his own, he just helps smooth things over. He’s just that nice! He gives everypony a good time and you kind of forget what you were mad about. The only issue here is that the loveable face really does enjoy a good drink. Or three. At breakfast."

pea_shooter_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 17th of November 962 in Trottingham\n\n§YBiography§!: When Pea Shooter was just a foal, one could hardly picture the cheerful little one to become a gun runner. With a loving family, the loveliest of childhood crush turned happy wife and good prospect as a shipping merchant between St. Petershoof and Skyfall. But still, even with all of that, little Pea Shooter was bored.\n\nIt could have all ended with a simple middle-aged pony finding a hobby or drinking the occasional excessive cider but then came the Stalliongrad Revolution. His family’s business was ruined but Pea Shooter saw an opportunity. With the help of a shady friend, he bought some guns from a Fezeran smuggler and travelled back home, selling them to a communist volunteer group. And also one Severnayan counter-revolutionary he had met in a bar. He made good bit on those deals and decided to make it his career. He travelled to Haukland, making some deals there before finding his way south, wherever there were bits and a need for gunpowder.\n\nIn 1005, he made his way to Zebrica, looking to make bank on that insane Yeti whilst he was still on a roll. He failed as the Storm King died and his conquest spree ended the following year. But! He was in Tobuck with some friends and it just so happened that one of those friends had friends guarding the supply depots in the region. And with half of Zebrica in turmoil, Pea Shooter exactly knew where to find his clientele.\n\nWith the help of Vasil Cel Tradat, he helped bring about the independence of Tobuck, the birth of harmonic republicanism in the region, found some pony to become its face while he became foreign affairs minister. As long as there was guns to sell in Tobuck, there would be business to do there for any good gun-runner.\n\nAnd Pea Shooter is more than a good one.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Bunnyshrubby"

TBK_great_pyre_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 4th of June 954 in Manehattan\n\n§YBiography§!: A selfless duty does not always bring glory and rewards to a soldier. Great Pyre witnessed this in 995, during the Severyana Revolution, where he fought as a sergeant in the Royal Guard. Only to be let go amongst other soldiers and officers for their actions in the fight against the communist revolutionaries. Instead of a peaceful life in Equestria, Great Pyre, bitter to the princess, left Equestria in the ranks of his fellow soldiers and joined with them in Zebrica as mercenaries, fighting not for glory but cold-hard cash.\n\n Yet service in the grand mercenary company was not enough for the ambitious stallion and he, with a core cadre of subordinates and local recruits, left to form their own mercenary band. This groud soon gained a ferocious reputation for their brutality and callous regard for life, bot theirs and the enemies. Rumours continued to swell, until across Northern Zebrica the company was dubbed the Band of Flayers: a name originally meant to mock their lust for loot to the point of looting the dead admist battle, Great Pyre eagerly adopted the name and further modified it by adding to it a motto. One which all members of the Band of Flayers adhered to.\n\n Down to the last fur!\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofuslied"
