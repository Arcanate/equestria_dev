 TBK_board_meeting_desc: "The future of a business is always uncertain, doubly so when in the risky trade of firearms, and triply so when it's sponsored by a state coming apart at the seams; it would be prudent to meet with the board of associates and take stock of the current situation."

 TBK_trip_to_manehattan_desc: "Even with the prospect of Tobuck and it's highly profitable arms trade collapsing, Pea Shooter is unwaveringly stoic about the whole situation.

 TBK_business_of_gun_running: "The Business of Gun Running"

 TBK_meeting_the_banker: "Meeting With the Banker"
 TBK_meeting_the_banker_desc: "One of the most important part of Tobuck's gun trade is offshore bank accounts; Tobuck is not a state with a stable economy.

 TBK_pay_day_2: "Our Pay Day"
