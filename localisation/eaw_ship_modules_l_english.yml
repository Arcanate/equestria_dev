 ship_armor_cb_1:0 "150mm Belt/25mm Deck"
 ship_armor_cb_1_short:0 "Large Cruiser Armor I"
 ship_armor_cb_1_desc:0 "Designed to protect the ship against smaller guns, this armor scheme weighs far less to allow for higher speed."
 ship_armor_cb_2:0 "305mm Belt/100mm Deck"
 ship_armor_cb_2_short:0 "Large Cruiser Armor II"
 ship_armor_cb_2_desc:0 "A compromise between speed and protection, this armor scheme is designed to defend a ship against the guns of cruisers and destroyers."
 ship_armor_cb_3:0 "330mm Belt/130mm Deck"
 ship_armor_cb_3_short:0 "Large Cruiser Armor III"
 ship_armor_cb_3_desc:0 "Designed with an eye towards weight limitations, this armor scheme attempts to maximize protection for the vital parts of a ship by leaving other areas exposed. This scheme is not supposed to stand up to battleship-grade weaponry for long."
 ship_sonar_3:0 "Advanced Sonar"
 ship_sonar_3_desc:0 "An advanced, high-intensity active noise emitter able to detect submerged submarine hulls from very long distances."
 ship_sonar_4:0 "Modern Sonar"
 ship_sonar_4_desc:0 "The modern sonar provides the most sensitive detection equipment able to identify and track submarines from long distances and wire data to ASW systems. It also enables easy detection of mines."
 ship_airplane_launcher_3_radar:0 "Advanced Radar Plane Catapult"
 ship_airplane_launcher_3_radar_desc:0 "An advanced launch mechanism that allows the ship to launch the largest type of reconnaissance plane with optimal range and speed. This model is outfitted with radar to detect surface ships."
ship_airplane_launcher_3_sonar:0 "Advanced Sonar Plane Catapult"
