 ship_armor_cb_2:0 "305mm Belt/100mm Deck"
 ship_armor_cb_2_short:0 "Large Cruiser Armor II"
 ship_armor_cb_2_desc:0 "A compromise between speed and protection, this armor scheme is designed to defend a ship against the guns of cruisers and destroyers."
 ship_armor_cb_3:0 "330mm Belt/130mm Deck"
 ship_armor_cb_3_short:0 "Large Cruiser Armor III"
 ship_armor_cb_3_desc:0 "Designed with an eye towards weight limitations, this armor scheme attempts to maximize protection for the vital parts of a ship by leaving other areas exposed. This scheme is not supposed to stand up to battleship-grade weaponry for long."
 ship_sonar_3:0 "Advanced Sonar"
 ship_sonar_3_desc:0 "An advanced, high-intensity active noise emitter able to detect submerged submarine hulls from very long distances."
 ship_sonar_4:0 "Modern Sonar"
 ship_sonar_4_desc:0 "The modern sonar provides the most sensitive detection equipment able to identify and track submarines from long distances and wire data to ASW systems. It also enables easy detection of mines."
 ship_airplane_launcher_3_radar:0 "Advanced Radar Plane Catapult"
 ship_airplane_launcher_3_radar_desc:0 "An advanced launch mechanism that allows the ship to launch the largest type of reconnaissance plane with optimal range and speed. This model is outfitted with radar to detect surface ships."
ship_airplane_launcher_3_sonar:0 "Advanced Sonar Plane Catapult"
 ship_airplane_launcher_3_sonar_desc:0 "An advanced launch mechanism that allows the ship to launch the largest type of reconnaissance plane with optimal range and speed. This model is outfitted with sonar to detect submarines."
 ship_armor_shbb_2:0 "460mm Belt/230mm Deck"
 ship_armor_shbb_2_short:0 "Super Heavy Armor IV"
ship_armor_shbb_2_desc:0 "Able to stand up to even the latest guns, this armor is truly unsurpassed. But no matter how much armor we pack on, the fact remains that torpedos threaten us just as much as ever."
 ship_anti_air_5:0 "45mm Quad AA"
 ship_anti_air_5_short:0 "Anti-Air V"
 ship_anti_air_5_desc:0 "Modern anti-air guns can pick apart even well-armored bombers or agile fighters, and computer-aided fire ensures they always hit their targets."
 ship_super_heavy_battery_2:0 "51 cm Cannon"
 ship_super_heavy_battery_2_short:0 "Super Heavy Battery II"
 ship_super_heavy_battery_2_desc:0 "Mounting fewer but even more outlandishly large guns, this battery is specifically designed to pierce through the armor of any other ship in existence. As a whole it does not hit noticeably harder, but it can penetrate even older super-heavy armor."
 ship_fire_control_system_4:0 "Semi-Modern Fire Control System"
 ship_fire_control_system_4_short:0 "Fire Control IV"
 ship_fire_control_system_4_desc:0 "The new generation of computers can calculate shots from outside visible range, letting us bombard our enemy from afar."
 ship_fire_control_system_5:0 "Modern Fire Control System"
 ship_fire_control_system_5_short:0 "Fire Control V"
 ship_fire_control_system_5_desc:0 "Computers are getting ever faster and more effective, enabling us to strike our enemies with supreme skill."
 ship_torpedo_data_computer_0:0 "Electrical Mechanical Computer"
 ship_torpedo_data_computer_0_short:0 "Torpedo Data Computer"
 ship_torpedo_data_computer_0_desc:0 "An early electromechanical analog computer mounted on submarines and surface vessals used for torpedo fire-control against ships running on the surface."

 ship_torpedo_data_computer_1_short:0 "Torpedo Data I"
 ship_torpedo_data_computer_1_desc:0 "The Torpedo Data Computer (TDC) is an early electromechanical analog computer mounted on submarines and surface vessals used for torpedo fire-control against ships running on the surface."
 ship_torpedo_data_computer_2:0 "Aft Angle Solver Computer"
 ship_torpedo_data_computer_2_short:0 "Torpedo Data II"
 ship_torpedo_data_computer_2_desc:0 "An angle solver computer calculates the required gyro angle to intercept target moving at a fixed course and speed."
 ship_torpedo_data_computer_3:0 "Position Keeper"
 ship_torpedo_data_computer_3_short:0 "Torpedo Data III"
 ship_torpedo_data_computer_3_desc:0 "The addition of a position keeper adds target tracking and position prediction capability that solves the equations of motion integrated over time allowing continious prediction of where the target is at any instant."
 ship_torpedo_data_computer_4:0 "Central Receiver"
 ship_torpedo_data_computer_4_short:0 "Torpedo Data IV"
 ship_torpedo_data_computer_4_desc:0 "The Mark IV TDC adds a receiver center section which allows simultanious solutions for the gyro angle and tracking of a target in real time."
 ship_radar_5:0 "Modern Integrated Fire Control Radar"
 ship_radar_5_short:0 "Radar V"
