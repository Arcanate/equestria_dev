 JES_to_arms_citizens_desc:0 "Long have we prepared for this day, secretly gathering weapons smuggled from Aquileia. Now it is finally time to open up our caches and distribute weaponry to all who need them. Sacred love of the Fatherland, lead, support our avenging arms!"
 JES_form_your_battalions:0 "Form Your Battalions!"
 JES_form_your_battalions_desc:0 "Arise, children of the Fatherland, the day of glory has arrived! The Francistrian oppressors are coming, trying to prevent us from regaining our liberty. Every citizen must join the fight for Tarrin, and rather perish in battle than return to a life of slavery."
 JES_march_on:0 "Let's March, Let's March!"
 JES_march_on_desc:0 "Enough of hiding in the hills! We can now fight like true soldiers, marching in formation to battle, accompanied by the music of marching bands! We shall battle like a cohesive force, united in purpose and well-disciplined.\nA father, in tears, says to his Babette: "Listen, our griffs are said to be beating the drums!""
 JES_impure_blood:0 "Let An Impure Blood"
 JES_impure_blood_desc:0 "Francistrian colonists brought in by the despotic Martlewing government have been nothing but parasites and oppressors in Tarrin. They have stolen our lands, imposed their barbaric language upon us and treat us like cattle. Tarrinians, for us, ah! What outrage, what furious action it must arouse!"
 JES_water_furrows:0 "Water Our Furrows!"
 JES_water_furrows_desc:0 "Our rivers are the lifeblood of our nation, and they may aid us in our struggle. We can open dams, breach levees and flood irrigation systems to turn our fertile fields into a marsh, difficult to traverse by the enemy. Everyone is a soldier to combat you, our foe, even our rivers!"
 
 JES_second_elections:0 "The Second Elections"
 JES_second_elections_desc:0 "Decades ago, in 980, the first elections were held in the Tarrinian Republic. Unfortunately, a new government was never formed before the Francistrians invaded our land. Now that we are free once more, new elections shall be held. The old parties have already been re-founded and campaigning for votes has begun. Hopefully, the democratic process won't be interrupted once again."
 JES_gaddafi_victory:0 "Freedom, Socialism, And Unity"
 JES_gaddafi_victory_desc:0 "Corina Trasviraire and the AST party have triumphed in the elections, promising to bring direct democracy and extensive social reform to Tarrin. They have radical ideas, but their promises of a brighter future for the nation have appealed to many, especially in the lower classes of society."
 JES_mixed_economy:0 "The Path To Socialism"
 JES_mixed_economy_desc:0 "As Caramel Marks wrote, the path to socialism goes through capitalism. This is why the Sisterly Leader has decreed the adoption of reforms which make the Tarrinian economy a mixed one. Entrepreneurs will be supported while at the same time vital assets, especially those owned by foreigners, will be nationalized. This combination should foster rapid economic growth in the country."
 JES_green_revolution:0 "The Green Revolution"
 JES_green_revolution_desc:0 "Securing self-suffiency in food production is an important priority for any nation. The Sisterly Leader has ordered that all land expropriated from Francistrian settlers shall be redistributed freely to native Tarrinians. New irrigation projects are also being funded to boost productivity and any farmers in need can receive generous subsidies from the government."
 JES_nationalize_transista_oil:0 "Nationalize Transista Oil Fields"
 JES_nationalize_transista_oil_desc:0 "Transista is a small province, but nonetheless important thanks to its oil deposits. However, these are currently owned by Wingbardian oil companies and investors, who drain much of the profit abroad. To strenghten the nation, the Sisterly Leader has decreed the nationalization of oil fields. She believes this is an essential step towards socialism."
 JES_republican_victory:0 "The Republican Cause"
 JES_republican_victory_desc:0 "Just like in 980, Meinard Nocère and the pro-Aquileian RTA party have won the elections. The spirit of the Aquileian Revolution lives on, and Meinard promises to continue the fight that began so long ago. Tarrin and Aquileia shall be united in purpose, bearing the shining torch of democracy in despotic Griffonia!"
 JES_ultranat_victory:0 "Tarrin Awakens"
 JES_ultranat_victory_desc:0 "Aquileians were no better than Francistrians. After fighting so hard to gain their freedom, Tarrinians would now rather die than give it away. They will accept no foreigner to rule over them, only a true, pure-blooded Tarrinian, whose young heart burns with passionate flame. Enemies of Tarrin beware! The eagle has broken free from its shackles."

Should the conflict with Tarrin drag on, it will become clear to all that it is a war between nation-states instead of a counter-insurgency operation. At that point, public opinion and military leadership will demand the war in Tarrin to end."

 ### Country Leader & General descriptions
 JES_leontina_desc:0 "Leontina Pandionne was born to a poor family of shepherds near the fortified town of Château Accueillant. Life in her small village was peaceful and quiet, and her conservative parents taught her to love her homeland of Tarrin. Even the republican revolution did not disturb her childhood, at least until Count Francis VIII decided to take advantage of the situation and invaded.\n\nLeontina's parents joined the local militia in the fight against the foreign invaders, but it was in vain. Her parents perished and her village was burned and looted by Francistrian soldiers. She fled into the hills that surrounded her home and barely survived in the wilds, until a group of republican resistance fighters found her and provided her with shelter and food.\n\nAfter Tarrin was annexed into the County of Francistria, Leontina's band of rebels joined the larger FLNT movement which was rapidly organizing in the region. Her fellow freedom fighters became her family, and she quickly learned to be useful to the resistance. At first her small size was beneficial in sabotage, and as she grew older she learned to use weapons and became skilled in setting up ambushes.\n\nAs she fought against the occupiers, her heart was filled with purpose: She had to avenge her parents and drive out the foreign invaders. Her upbringing meant she was familiar with the countryside and traditional Tarrinian values, and thus could easily recruit peasants to join the ranks of FLNT.\n\nIf FLNT achieves its goal of independence, she feels obliged to participate in the elections, as if it was her responsibility to protect Tarrin and its culture. She is especially popular among the peasantry of Tarrin."
 JES_meinard_desc:0 "When the Aquileian revolution broke out in 980, it was Meinard Nocère who led the uprising in Tarrin against the despotic Discret Countess. It was him who ordered the execution of the tyrant by guillotine. It was him who was the first President of the Republic of Tarrin, preparing her homeland for joining the Aquileian Republic. It was him who led the desperate struggle against Count Francis VIII and his forces. It was him who fled into the hills and founded the FLNT, even as the revolution crumbled around him.\n\nMeinard's status among Tarrinians is close to mythical. For the longest time, most did not know if he even was alive anymore, or merely a story older Tarrinians told, of a hero who would one day miraculously liberate Tarrin from foreign oppression. For a long time, event the Governor-General Vittorio Felice was unsure if he was still alive or not.\n\nNow that FLNT has declared Tarrin's independence, Meinard has come out of hiding and revealed himself, leaving Tarrinians in awe and Francistrians in shock. Its as if he had risen from the dead to stand aside the griffons of Tarrin as they broke their chains once more.\n\nMeinard has close ties to the main republican movement in Aquileia, and especially to Théodore Vérany. He was born in Aquileia, but in his eyes Aquileians and Tarrinians are kinfolk with shared heritage. He has spent so many years fighting for Tarrin's freedom that no one cares where he comes from and most Tarrinians consider him a true national hero of Tarrin."
 JES_corina_desc:0 "Corina Trasviraire, commonly known as Colonel Corina, is an eccentric figure. Coming from a humble background, she joined the Royal Army Academy of Tarrin, but betrayed her superiors and joined the revolutionaries in 980. During the first Tarrinian elections, she founded AST, a socialist nationalist party, despite still being fairly young and inexperienced. She is strongly religious and nationalistic, yet is without a doubt a devout socialist. She advocates republican rule, yet is known for her authoritarian tendencies within the party.\n\nDue to leading a group of dissident officers who rebelled against the County, the republicans had a difficult time trusting her. Yet over the years, she slowly gained the trust she deserved by bravely fighting against the Francistrian invaders and organizing both passive and active resistance to occupation. At the same time, her popularity has grown among the citizens of Tarrin.\n\nReclusive, irrational and impulsive, yet also naive, intelligent and pious. To this day, Corina remains a controversial figure, but none doubt that she genuinely cares about the liberation of Tarrin and its inhabitants."
 
 ### Events
 tarrin.1.t:0 "[FRN.GetNameDef] Invades!"
 tarrin.1.d:0 "Our former oppressor, the [FRN.GetAdjective] government, has not recognized our declaration of independence and has mobilized their army. Their units are beginning to cross the border at this very moment. The foreign tyrants and slavers wish to extinguish the flame of our freedom before it truly gets to shine!\n\nWe will do everything possible to fight for our hard-earned liberty, but it might not be enough in the face of [FRN.GetAdjective] military might. Our only hope might lie in the west, in our Aquileian cousins. They did not come to our aid in 980s, but perhaps they will do so now, to redeem their lost honour and to prevent Tarrin from falling once again into possession of non-Aquileians."
 tarrin.1.a:0 "Seek aid from Aquileia!"
 tarrin.1.b:0 "We are on our own. Prepare for battle!"
 
 tarrin.2.t:0 "Tarrin Calls For Aid!"
 tarrin.2.d:0 "Tarrin, a region that was once a subject of Aquileia, recently declared independence as the freedom fighters of FLNT expelled the [FRN.GetAdjective] garrison. However, now the [FRN.GetAdjective] has been mobilized to retake the region and crush the resistance. The republican guerillas are now asking for us to come to their aid, so the region does not once again fall under foreign domination. While we may have ideological differences with the FLNT, should we simply stand by as our cousins are slaughtered by the lackeys of Wingbardy? If we do so, it might motivate Wingbardy to intervene as well, and escalate this into a large-scale conflict. We must be cautious."
 tarrin.2.a:0 "And Aquileia will answer!"
 tarrin.2.b:0 "We refuse to cooperate with terrorists of FLNT."
 
 tarrin.3.t:0 "Aquileia Abandons Us!"
 tarrin.3.d:0 "Unfortunately, our calls for aid have fallen on deaf ears, and the Aquileians refuse to come to our aid, leaving us to face the invader alone. We are outnumbered and outmatched, but we will not abandon hope! Our resistance hasn't faltered in the face of impossible odds before, and it shall not falter now. We will have to hold on as long as possible, so the enemy morale will falter and they will seek peace. Fight on, sons and daughters of Tarrin! Do not let the fire of freedom be extinguished so easily!"
 tarrin.3.a:0 "We will fight to the last griffon!"
 
 tarrin.4.t:0 "[FRN.GetNameDef] Retreats From Tarrin!"
 tarrin.4.d:0 "After months of bloodshed and desperate fighting, it seems the [FRN.GetAdjective] forces are pulling out of Tarrin. They expected a quick campaign and were unprepared for a full-scale war that lasted for this long. As such, they've had to retreat and enter the negotiation table with us. A cease-fire has been signed, and our independence secured, at least for now. The crisis is over and democratic elections for who shall lead the nation will soon be held.\n\nThe time for nation-wide celebration has come as we have boldly defeated our former oppressors! Tarrinians will never again be slaves to any foreign despot!"
 tarrin.4.a:0 "Vive le Tarrin! Vive la liberté!"
 
 tarrin.5.t:0 "Reunion"
 tarrin.5.d:0 "It was wise for the three leading figures of FLNT to never gather together in one place, so the leadership of the movement could never be eliminated in a single ambush. Therefore they almost never met each other, communicating exclusively with encrypted letters and telegrams, staying hidden and separate for as long as was needed.\n\nNow, they no longer had to hide like rats, or fear Francistrian agents spying their moves. They could meet freely, though just in case they still met in their secret underground headquarters. Meinard Nocère was already waiting there as Leontina Pandionne and Corina Trasviraire arrived, peacefully smoking a pipe and observing drafted military plans on the table. Leontina came first. The young freedom fighter bowed in respect.\n"Ah, little Leontina, good to see you!" Meinard said with a smile. "You've become a true adult since we last met."\n"It's been a while, hasn't it?" She replied. "My entire life I've spent fighting against the barbarians. To think it could soon be over..."\n"Let's not get optimistic just yet. We still have to secure our independence."\nNext Corina entered the room, saluting Meinard like a soldier, her face stone-cold and serious.\n"You can drop the act, Corina, it's just the three of us here."\nCorina's expression became warmer and she let out a hearty chuckle, then sat down. "I wish I could drop the act when I am around my soldiers. There is no reason to be serious when we should rejoice instead!"\n"Not yet. It would be premature."\nCorina smirked. "And here I thought you were the optimist. What's the matter?"\n"Francistria may yet send their army to 'pacify' Tarrin. Aquileia may not recognize our independence. And to the north, stormclouds gather. We must make contingency plans for every scenario. We have gained our freedom, but we must continue to fight for it. Let us not rest on our laurels just yet."\nCorina and Leontina nodded, and the three began to plan together."
 tarrin.5.a:0 "The fight for Tarrin has only begun."
 
 tarrin.6.t:0 "Refugee Crisis"
 tarrin.6.d:0 "What started as a small stream of refugees has quickly turned into a flood. Thousands upon thousands of Francistrian colonists and Tarrinian collaborators are fleeing into Francistria proper, carrying what they can with them. Many of them lack food or water, or are either sickly or injured. Long wagon caravans clog up the roads, making it difficult to supply our military forces.\n\nRefugees are reporting about atrocities committing about Tarrinians, as well as forced expulsions and seizure of property. Some of the Tarrinians were treated even worse than the colonists, being regarded as heinous traitors.\n\nNow the government has to do what it can to take care of all these homeless, desperate refugees, straining its resources and distracting from any efforts to pacify Tarrin."
 tarrin.6.a:0 "FLNT are nothing but terrorists."
 
 tarrin.7.t:0 "The Pan-Aquileian Cause"
 tarrin.7.d:0 "Meinard Nocère, the hero of Tarrin, was relaxing on the balcony of his office and smoking a pipe. The weather was clear and sunny, which reflected the mood in the country at the time. Meinard sighed wistfully, somehow knowing deep inside it wouldn't last.\n\nThere was a creaking sound as Leontina Pandionne opened the door to the balcony. "Ah, there you are, Marshal. I was looking for you."\nMeinard blew out smoke from his beak. "Oh yes, you wanted to meet. What's the matter, little Leontina?"\nShe sat down on a chair next to him, took in a deep breath as if preparing to fly off a cliff, and spoke. "Marshal, do you still... intend to cooperate with the Aquileians?"\n"With the republicans? Why yes, of course. They are our close friends. Their cause is our cause."\n"But their cause is doomed to fail, I fear. And even if it didn't, why should we still consider them friends? Where was Aquileia when the barbarians invaded?"\nMeinard frowned, and inhaled smoke from his pipe. "They were busy securing their own revolution. Besides, Francistria was allied with Wingbardy. They couldn't risk a war with them."\nLeontina pouted. "Or maybe they don't care for Tarrin and its independence. Do you still intend for Tarrin to become part of Aquileia? Just throw away the hard-fought freedom we've earned?"\nThe older griffon seemed increasingly uncomfortable. "Well, we'd still be free being part of an Aquileian Republic, just not sovereign. For me, it's democracy that truly matters."\nLeontina stood up and grimaced. "So it's as I feared. Your mind is set, I can tell, but I cannot agree with that." She placed a claw on her chest. "By Boreas, I am a Tarrinian, not an Aquileian!"\nMeinard set aside his pipe. "Little Leontina, please, calm down-"\n"I've now made my decision. I will run for President, and if I win, I will make sure Tarrin remains truly free. I'd rather die than live again in slavery!" She then took off, flying away from the balcony.\n\nMeinard was certain he saw tears in her eyes as she did so."
 tarrin.7.a:0 "Tarrinians think she's misguided."
 tarrin.7.b:0 "Tarrinians think she's right."
 
 tarrin.8.t:0 "The Blue Book"
 tarrin.8.d:0 "With elections approaching, one of the leading figures of FLNT's socialist wing and the head of the socialist AST party, Corina Trasviraire, was strangely absent from public stage. However, it turns out he was just preparing the publication of a book he had written during his time as a resistance fighter. Now, it has been released across the nation and copies are being given out freely to commoners in towns and villages. Of course, many citizens remain illiterate, but those that weren't read the book out of curiosity.\n\nThe book was simply called "The Blue Book". It was relatively short, written personally by Corina and meant to be read by everyone in Tarrin. It outlined Corina's own political views and her plans for the future, if she will be elected President.\n\nThe book condemns capitalism, but also communism, and curiously also denounces political parties, parliaments and constitutions. Instead, it advocates socialism, direct democracy and nationalism. Instead of a parliament, Tarrin should have a system of popular committees and conferences so power is not delegated to a ruling minority. It calls for the abolishment of wage labour, elimination of exploitation and devolution of the state. She emphasised the importance of family, equality and freedom of speech.\n\nIn an interview with a reporter for a newly-founded Tarrin newspaper, Meinard Nocère called the book "a bunch of nonsense" and expressed his disappointment with Corina running for Presidency, saying it makes the nation more divided than it should be."
 tarrin.8.a:0 "Tarrinians care little for the book."
 tarrin.8.b:0 "Tarrinians fall in love with the book!"
 
 tarrin.9.t:0 "Two Sides Of The Same Coin"
 tarrin.9.d:0 "Soon after Leontina heard the news that Corina was running for presidency, she wanted to have a public political debate with Corina. Because of Corina's nationalist platform, she saw her as a challenger who could easily win the favour of her own voting base. Leontina knew she'd have to beat her face-to-face in a debate to prove herself as a superior candidate.\n\nCorina accepted the invitation to a debate and soon enough the two met on stage in Griffoble, their speech being broadcast by radio so Tarrinians across the country could listen to it.\nAfter short and formal introductions, Leontina opened the debate proper. "First of all, I want to say that I've read your book, just so we're clear. And while I have tremendous respect for you as a resistance fighter, I found many things to disagree with in this tome. And to be frank, some of it is just strange. You condemn representative democracy, yet are trying to get elected President?"\nCorina shrugged with her characteristic, laid back smirk. "Well, can't reform representative democracy into something else without becoming President first, you know? I might be a revolutionary, but I only overthrow monarchical regimes, not democratic ones."\n"Hmpf, fair enough. But you also advocate for socialism. Don't you know socialism as an economic system cannot work?"\nCorina almost burst out laughing. "Hah, everygriff knows true socialism hasn't been tried yet."\n"And these conferences and committees, they sound borderline anarchical. How can Tarrin be strong and united if it is made so internally divided?"\n"You know, you're doing pretty well in a debate for someone so young," Corina said with a warm smile. "I'm impressed, you have a fiery spirit and I respect that. But in debates it is usually polite to let the other side speak freely instead of just bombarding them with critique."\nLeontina was taken aback and stuttered with her speech. "O-oh, right. My apologies."\n\nThe debate continued long into the afternoon, with both sides making good points."
 tarrin.9.a:0 "Tarrinians are impressed with Leontina's arguments."
 tarrin.9.b:0 "Tarrinians are swayed by Corina's arguments."
 tarrin.9.c:0 "Tarrinians see both sides as flawed."
 
 tarrin.10.t:0 "Election Day"
 tarrin.10.d:0 "All of Tarrin was abuzz with activity on the day of the elections. Many of the older Tarrinians felt nostalgic for the last election day in 980, while the younger ones were eager to finally have their voices be heard. As the country was in need of both a head of state and a parliament, it was a dual election of sorts, with both votes being held simultaneously. The three main contenders for political positions were RTA, a Tarrinian-Aquileian republican party led by Meinard Nocère, PNT, a relatively young nationalist party whose figurehead was Leontina Pandionne, and AST, the old socialist party whose leader had always been Corina Trasviraire. It was quite likely that the party that would win a majority would also get their candidate voted President, so most Tarrinians treated both elections as one.\n\nVoter turnout was even higher than it had been in 980, and counting began as soon as the ballots were closed. All of Tarrin held its breath and eagerly awaited to hear the results being revealed on the radio, as it would decide the fate of the nation itself. Despite stark differences between the policies of the three parties, the country was peaceful as its griffons respected the democratic process. Whatever the results may be, they will be accepted by all three parties and their leaders."
 tarrin.10.a:0 "Meinard Nocère becomes President!"
 tarrin.10.b:0 "Leontina Pandionne becomes President!"
 tarrin.10.c:0 "Corina Trasviraire becomes President!"
 
 tarrin.11.t:0 "Tarrin Joins The Republic!"
 tarrin.11.d:0 "A Tarrinian delegation has arrived in our capital, led by none other than Meinard Nocère, the leader of the local republican movement. They have formally presented us the request to be annexed into [Root.GetNameDef], as long as Tarrin receives political autonomy and cultural protections.\n\n[Root.GetLeader] has graciously accepted the proposal and the process to integrate the region has begun. Tarrin was once a County subject to the Discret monarchy, but the Count was overthrown in 980. Already back then, Meinard Nocère won the elections and wished to join the fellow revolutionaries in Aquila, but before that could be done, the Francistrians invaded.\n\nNow at last, after so many years of separation, Tarrin can rejoin the fatherland!"
 tarrin.11.a:0 "Hurrah!"
 
 tarrin.12.t:0 "Peace And Reconciliation"
 tarrin.12.d:0 "In the center of Tarrin stood the Château de Tarrin, former palace of the deposed Count. After the revolution in 980, it had been swiftly repurposed into the Presidential Palace, but after the Francistrian invasion became the headquarters of the Governor-General Vittorio Felice. With the foreign occupiers expelled, the building once more became the personal quarters of the President of Tarrin.\n\nCorina Trasviraire, however, was still not content with the building's status. As she explored its luxurious halls, she thought of what could be sold off or melted into ingots. In her mind, the entire building would have to be repurposed, either into a meeting place of popular committees, or a museum dedicated to the revolution. She had little interest in living in such a spacious and extravagant place. But for now, it would have to suffice.\n\nShe opened a door and entered a conference room, where Meinard Nocère and Leontina Pandionne were already waiting. As she sat down, Meinard smirked. "How typical of you to be late for your own meeting."\nCorina shrugged and rested her paws on the table. "Had a look around the place, I'm still not familiar with it. In any case, I did want to talk with you two. You lost the presidential race, and I know that you disagree with my plans for Tarrin. Which makes me question if you still wish to remain loyal to the Republic."\nLeontina rolled her eyes, while Meinard chuckled. "Of course. No matter what happens, we three are bound by blood and oaths of loyalty to one another."\n"At least you're not willing to simply let go of our sovereignty," Leontina said to Corina, glancing at Meinard.\n"Good, good. Our personal disagreements are secondary to national unity. Besides, it'd be a shame to lose such talented military leaders."\n"Flattery won't win our undying loyalty," Leontina said. "But if you prove that you know what you're doing and make Tarrin prosper, I don't see a reason to oppose you in any way."\n"Agreed," Meinard said. "Losing an election is nothing compared to losing my country. Promise you won't let that happen."\nCorina smiled and saluted the Marshal. "I promise.""

 tarrin.15.d:0 "Monarchism was never fully erased from Tarrin. A small minority of griffons, mostly former aristocrats and army officers, still support the claim of Guillaume Discret to the throne of the County of Tarrin. They were the primary collaborators with the Francistrian occupational authority and loathe the republican movement.\n\nNow that FLNT has succeeded in its rebellion and held democratic elections, it seems the monarchist who still remain in the country have quickly radicalised and taken up arms to resist the republican government. It is possible they receive foreign support from monarchist supporters in Aquileia and possibly from Francistria as well, though these claims have not been fully confirmed. Whatever the case, they are conducting terrorist attacks across the country, bombing government buildings and officials, as well as spreading pro-monarchist and anti-republican propaganda. They call themselves the "Burgundy Order", named after the colour of the Discret coat of arms, and are proving to be dangerous despite their small size."
 tarrin.15.a:0 "Curse those bootlickers!"
 
 tarrin.16.t:0 "Tarrin Asks For Diplomatic Recognition"
 tarrin.16.d:0 "The separatists in Tarrin, who recently gained their independence from [FRN.GetNameDef], have sent us a diplomatic envoy, asking for their newborn nation to be recognized by our government as a sovereign country.\n\nAccepting this request would mean that we not only acknowledge their independence as legal, but also enables us to form friendly ties with the young country. However, doing so would also likely anger some Francistrians, who may still think that Tarrin is a rightful part of their nation. Not only that, but justifying the military occupation of an area is much easier if you do not recognize it as a legal entity. And in the end, does Griffonia truly need yet another tiny statelet that can hardly sustain itself?"

A [From.GetAdjective] embassy will soon be established in our capital, allowing us to form closer relations with them in the future."
 tarrin.17.a:0 "A victory for our cause!"
 
 tarrin.18.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Does Not Recognize Our Independence"
 tarrin.18.d:0 "Bad news from [From.GetNameDef]. Their government has officially refused to recognize our nation as a sovereign, independent country, and continues to consider that our country legally belongs to either Aquileia, Francistria or a Pan-Griffonian government. They have also rejected our proposal to establish a [From.GetAdjective] in our capital. This will make it difficult to form proper diplomatic relations with them, and endangers our liberty. We should be wary of them in the future."
 tarrin.18.a:0 "We don't need their recognition anyways."
 
 tarrin.19.t:0 "Tarrin Nationalizes Transista Oil Fields"
 tarrin.19.d:0 "Wingbardian oil companies have issued a complaint to the government that [JES.GetNameDef] has decided to nationalize their oil fields in Transista, meaning the companies lost most of their properties and investments without compensation. [JES.GetLeader] has publicly stated that she wished to secure control of the vital resource and ensure most of the profits would remain inside the nation instead of being funneled abroad.\n\nWe have decided to issue a formal protest to the Tarrinian government, albeit there is no support for further action. We have, however, promised to compensate the oil companies for their losses so they can continue to function normally."
 tarrin.19.a:0 "How rude."
