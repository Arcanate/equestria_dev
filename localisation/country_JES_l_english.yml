 ### Foci
 JES_to_arms_citizens:0 "To Arms, Citizens!"
 JES_to_arms_citizens_desc:0 "Long have we prepared for this day, secretly gathering weapons smuggled from Aquileia. Now it is finally time to open up our caches and distribute weaponry to all who need them. Sacred love of the Fatherland, lead, support our avenging arms!"
 JES_form_your_battalions:0 "Form Your Battalions!"
 JES_form_your_battalions_desc:0 "Arise, children of the Fatherland, the day of glory has arrived! The Francistrian oppressors are coming, trying to prevent us from regaining our liberty. Every citizen must join the fight for Tarrin, and rather perish in battle than return to a life of slavery."
 JES_march_on:0 "Let's March, Let's March!"
 JES_march_on_desc:0 "Enough of hiding in the hills! We can now fight like true soldiers, marching in formation to battle, accompanied by the music of marching bands! We shall battle like a cohesive force, united in purpose and well-disciplined.\nA father, in tears, says to his Babette: "Listen, our griffs are said to be beating the drums!""
 JES_impure_blood:0 "Let An Impure Blood"
 JES_impure_blood_desc:0 "Francistrian colonists brought in by the despotic Martlewing government have been nothing but parasites and oppressors in Tarrin. They have stolen our lands, imposed their barbaric language upon us and treat us like cattle. Tarrinians, for us, ah! What outrage, what furious action it must arouse!"
 JES_water_furrows:0 "Water Our Furrows!"
 JES_water_furrows_desc:0 "Our rivers are the lifeblood of our nation, and they may aid us in our struggle. We can open dams, breach levees and flood irrigation systems to turn our fertile fields into a marsh, difficult to traverse by the enemy. Everyone is a soldier to combat you, our foe, even our rivers!"
 
 JES_second_elections:0 "The Second Elections"
 JES_second_elections_desc:0 "Decades ago, in 980, the first elections were held in the Tarrinian Republic. Unfortunately, a new government was never formed before the Francistrians invaded our land. Now that we are free once more, new elections shall be held. The old parties have already been re-founded and campaigning for votes has begun. Hopefully, the democratic process won't be interrupted once again."
 
 JES_gaddafi_victory:0 "Freedom, Socialism, And Unity"
 JES_gaddafi_victory_desc:0 "Corina Trasviraire and the AST party have triumphed in the elections, promising to bring direct democracy and extensive social reform to Tarrin. They have radical ideas, but their promises of a brighter future for the nation have appealed to many, especially in the lower classes of society."
 JES_mixed_economy:0 "The Path To Socialism"
 JES_mixed_economy_desc:0 "As Caramel Marks wrote, the path to socialism goes through capitalism. This is why the Sisterly Leader has decreed the adoption of reforms which make the Tarrinian economy a mixed one. Entrepreneurs will be supported while at the same time vital assets, especially those owned by foreigners, will be nationalized. This combination should foster rapid economic growth in the country."
 JES_green_revolution:0 "The Green Revolution"
 JES_green_revolution_desc:0 "Securing self-suffiency in food production is an important priority for any nation. The Sisterly Leader has ordered that all land expropriated from Francistrian settlers shall be redistributed freely to native Tarrinians. New irrigation projects are also being funded to boost productivity and any farmers in need can receive generous subsidies from the government."
 JES_nationalize_transista_oil:0 "Nationalize Transista Oil Fields"
 JES_nationalize_transista_oil_desc:0 "Transista is a small province, but nonetheless important thanks to its oil deposits. However, these are currently owned by Wingbardian oil companies and investors, who drain much of the profit abroad. To strenghten the nation, the Sisterly Leader has decreed the nationalization of oil fields. She believes this is an essential step towards socialism."
 JES_invest_into_military:0 "Military Build-Up"
 JES_invest_into_military_desc:0 "Profits from oil exports should be invested not only into improving the wellbeing of the citizenry, but also into the strenghtening of our arms industry. A nation's sovereignty can only be truly secured with military force, and an army is only as strong as its supply chain is. Expanding arms production will also provide jobs for thousands."
 JES_more_wages_less_rent:0 "More Wages, Less Rents"
 JES_more_wages_less_rent_desc:0 "Workers of Tarrin have been exploited long enough, not only by foreigners but by greedy capitalists and landowners also. The minimum wage will from now on be doubled, price controls will be put in place for essential products and rents will be reduced across the board. This will greatly improve the livelihood of the Tarrinian citizenry."
 JES_companies_to_cooperatives:0 "Companies Into Cooperatives"
 JES_companies_to_cooperatives_desc:0 "The Sisterly Leader wishes to tear down bureaucracy and eliminate the private sector of the economy. For this purpose, control of businesses and companies will be ceded to the workers who work in them. Cooperatives with democratically chosen representatives will replace the dictatorial leadership of capitalists and business owners."
 JES_house_for_every_family:0 "A House For Every Family"
 JES_house_for_every_family_desc:0 "The Francistrians cared little for the living conditions of Tarrinians. Many towns, especially Tarrin itself, have squalorous slums or homeless griffons wandering the streets. The Sisterly Leader cannot tolerate such poverty in our glorious Tarrin, and has decreed extensive housing construction programs to provide a dwelling for every family."
 JES_haven_of_socialism:0 "Haven Of Socialism"
 JES_haven_of_socialism_desc:0 "Through patient reform, we are building a truly socialist economy, one owned by the state and managed by the workers. Living standards in our small country have quickly risen and even skeptics of socialism have to admit that our Sisterly Leader's policies have worked effectively. Now we can reap the red fruits of our labour!"
 JES_state_control_trade:0 "State-Controlled Trade"
 JES_state_control_trade_desc:0 "Greedy, self-serving individuals have exploited Tarrinian economy long enough. From this day onwards, Tarrin will take control of its own trade, with the state managing imports and exports directly. Government-owned supermarkets will provide the citizenry everything they need, keeping the prices low and ensuring the profits go to the workers."
 
 JES_disband_parliament:0 "Disband The Parliament"
 JES_disband_parliament_desc:0 "The newly formed parliament is not a fitting governmental body for a democratic nation. It empowers a small minority of elected representatives, leaving the citizens with only one privilege: The right to vote. The President has decreed the dissolution of the parliament, so it can be replaced with a more righteous institution."
 JES_popular_committees:0 "Establish Popular Committees"
 JES_popular_committees_desc:0 "The next step in the political restructuring of Tarrin is establishing Popular Committees, allowing for more direct political participation than the old parliamentary system. These local councils will mobilize the populace to be more involved in political decision-making. Schools and universities will have their own Committees to enlighten the young."
 JES_dissolve_parties:0 "Dissolve Political Parties"
 JES_dissolve_parties_desc:0 "Political parties are elitist, corrupt clubs for the rich. The Republic of Tarrin has no need for such organizations. Our populace cannot be divided by factionalism, which these parties exacerbate. Instead, regional Basic Congresses will fulfill the political needs of the citizenry, allowing them to vote directly on local matters."
 JES_moralism:0 "Moralism"
 JES_moralism_desc:0 "Tarrinian society must have moral superiority over other cultures, especially that of decadent Francistrians. The Sisterly Leader has decreed the banning of alcohol, encouragement of traditional dress codes and the closing of immoral establishments. Eliminating these vices will improve the moral character of our citizenry and make their lives better."
 JES_purge_monarchists:0 "Purge The Monarchists"
 JES_purge_monarchists_desc:0 "The pathetic remnants of pro-monarchists in the nation have reared their ugly heads. The Sisterly Leader has ordered them to be dealt with quickly. FLNT veterans will outsmart the resistance and Popular Courts will be established to hold trials for any monarchists captured. Lastly, the despicable claimant Count will be sentenced to death, in absentia."
 JES_erase_foreign_influence:0 "Erase Foreign Influences"
 JES_erase_foreign_influence_desc:0 "Thirty years of Francistrian occupation and separation from Aquileia have tainted the country. It must be healed before it is too late, and like a surgeon we must conduct a swift operation. Any Francistrians remaining in the country will be expelled, their property confiscated and their cultural influences removed."
 JES_adult_literacy_program:0 "Adult Literacy Program"
 JES_adult_literacy_program_desc:0 "It is easy to teach young griffs to read, as they are open-minded and able to learn easily. But illteracy among adults must be erased as well, and that is a much more difficult task. The Sisterly Leader has requested new social programs to offer free and mandatory reading courses for all citizens who still cannot read."
 JES_free_university_education:0 "Free University Education"
 JES_free_university_education_desc:0 "Charging money for the privilege of learning is truly rapacious and capitalistic. Thankfully, all education in our country will be free of charge, even at university level. Now brilliant minds can be cultivated even if they belong to poor griffons. Hopefully, many new bright minds will join the ranks of our intelligentsia."
 JES_pan_aquileianism:0 "Pan-Aquileianism"
 JES_pan_aquileianism_desc:0 "Aquileians are one of the major cultural groups of griffonkind, alongside Herzlanders and Wingbardians. Aquileians have shared history, heritage and traditions, as well as similar languages. It has been many years since Aquileians were united under a single nation. However, the Sisterly Leader has a dream, and it shall not be deferred."
 
 JES_reestablish_the_army:0 "Re-Establish The Army"
 JES_reestablish_the_army_desc:0 "The army of the Republic of Tarrin was a direct successor to the army of the County, but it was effectively destroyed during the Francistrian invasion, its soldiers imprisoned, forced into exile or joining the FLNT. Now that we have regained our independence, we can rebuild the army that was lost."
 JES_standardize_equipment:0 "Standardize Military Equipment"
 JES_standardize_equipment_desc:0 "Many soldiers in our recreated army are former resistance fighters, who fought with whatever weapons they could get their claws on. However, maintaining these weapons was often difficult due to numerous designs in use, and much of the equipment was outdated. A proper army needs proper weapons, or else it is little more than a band of rabble."
 JES_promote_officers:0 "Promote Officers"
 JES_promote_officers_desc:0 "The new army is in need of an officer corps large enough to lead the soldiers in battle. Therefore [Root.GetLeader] has authorized the promotion of new officers from the ranks of common soldiers. Those who proved themselves most capable during the years of resistance will be prioritized first. This will revitalize our forces and bring fresh minds into our leadership."
 JES_military_academy:0 "Reopen The Griffoble Military Academy"
 JES_military_academy_desc:0 "Before the Francistrian occupation, Griffoble used to have one of the most famous military academies in Aquileia. It was an old and prestigious organization, responsible for training many capable military leaders and cultivating new strategies for warfare. It was closed by the Francistrians, but now we can finally reopen the venerable academy."
 JES_army_motorization:0 "Army Motorization"
 JES_army_motorization_desc:0 "The future of warfare is on wheels and treads. However, reaching that future will take time, requiring production and supply of trucks, cars and other vehicles. While Tarrin lacks a strong industry to mass produce them, efforts can be made to acquire them from abroad instead. This will aid with efforts to further modernize the armed forces."
 JES_big_money_big_women_big_guns:0 "Supplying The Artillery"
 JES_big_money_big_women_big_guns_desc:0 "Artillery is the key of industrial war. It allows the weakening of defensive positions, the dispersal of attack formations and destruction of fortifications. Yet it requires the manufacture of a large amount of shells and guns to be effective. For now, we must rely on a foreign supplier."
 JES_tank_experiments:0 "Tank Experiments"
 JES_tank_experiments_desc:0 "The so-called tank is revolutionizing warfare, and the younger officers, always open to new ideas, are advocating for them to be adopted by the Tarrinian army. These technological marvels are difficult to manufacture, but very powerful on the battlefield as long as they are used effectively. Therefore, experiments with making and using tanks shall take place."
 JES_hire_aquileian_advisors:0 "Hire Aquileian Advisors"
 JES_hire_aquileian_advisors_desc:0 "The Aquileians have much to teach for the Tarrinian military. There are many experts, theorists and veterans with useful knowledge. Private deals can be struck with such individuals who might be interested in aiding us in exchange for regular pay. It will be a worthwhile investment, to make sure the latest innovations can be exploited by us."
 JES_establish_an_air_force:0 "Establish An Air Force"
 JES_establish_an_air_force_desc:0 "Winged infantry is no longer enough to secure the air, with the advent of metallic planes armed with heavy weaponry. If the Tarrinian air space is to be secured, then a proper air force will be needed to defend it. Personel will be trained and planes acquired from contractors. The Transista airfield will be the main base of the new air force."
 
 JES_republican_victory:0 "The Republican Cause"
 JES_republican_victory_desc:0 "Just like in 980, Meinard Nocère and the pro-Aquileian RTA party have won the elections. The spirit of the Aquileian Revolution lives on, and Meinard promises to continue the fight that began so long ago. Tarrin and Aquileia shall be united in purpose, bearing the shining torch of democracy in despotic Griffonia!"
 JES_third_revolution:0 "The Third Revolution"
 JES_third_revolution_desc:0 "The Second Aquileian Revolution ended in bitter failure. But President Meinard already learned to never abandon hope, and to keep fighting until the end. Next time, the Aquileian Revolution shall succeed, and the tyranny of the disgusting Discret dynasty shall end. Third time is the charm, as they say."
 JES_contact_the_exiles:0 "Contact The Exiles"
 JES_contact_the_exiles_desc:0 "The Aquileian underground resistance movement has been forced to flee the country after the monarchist triumph and now live in hiding, scattered across the world. But now they are needed once more. They can come to the safe haven of Tarrin as long as they agree to continue fighting for the Republican cause."
 JES_anti_monarchist_propaganda:0 "Anti-Monarchist Propaganda"
 JES_anti_monarchist_propaganda_desc:0 "The griffons of Tarrin must be galvanized into revolutionary action against supporters of monarchy. They need to be reminded that our true enemies are not the Francistrians, but monarchists. They have always wanted a crowned head to oppress the common folk in the name of Boreas. There can be no negotiation or reasoning with such deluded minds."
 JES_foreign_legion:0 "Tarrinian Foreign Legion"
 JES_foreign_legion_desc:0 "The word of our cause has spread far and wide already, and many are flocking to our blue-red-white banner of revolution. They are bringing with them arms and equipment, so they simply need to be organized into proper fighting units. Thus, the Tarrinian Foreign Legion shall be established, and those wishing to join will go through rigorous training."
 JES_allies_in_periphery:0 "Allies In The Periphery"
 JES_allies_in_periphery_desc:0 "While the local leaders in the Periphery used the chaos of the First Aquileian Revolution to their advantage by declaring independence, this does not mean they are necessarily opposed to our cause. We share a common enemy, the Kingdom of Aquileia, and thus we can put our differences aside for now. We need to stand united against the Discrets!"
 JES_infiltrate_aquileia:0 "Infiltrate Aquileia"
 JES_infiltrate_aquileia_desc:0 "It is said knowing is half the battle. The Second Revolution failed because the strength of the monarchists was underestimated. The same mistake will not be repeated this time; Meinard has already ordered extensive preparations to be made by comprehensive intelligence gathering."
 JES_prepare_partisans:0 "Prepate The Partisans"
 JES_prepare_partisans_desc:0 "The freedom fighters of FLNT are veterans of guerilla warfare. They will train new partisan detachments which will be secretly sent into Aquileia with support from republican sympathisers. They will prepare local revolts to seize control of territory once we are ready to launch the Third Revolution."
 JES_incite_resistance:0 "Incite Popular Resistance"
 JES_incite_resistance_desc:0 "The willpower of the common griffons took a heavy blow from the defeat of the Second Revolution, but we must inform them that the Republicans never give up, so it is too early to abandon hope. Our agents will spread the word, urging Aquileians to join the anti-monarchist resistance and providing them with weapons they need."
 
 JES_ultranat_victory:0 "Tarrin Awakens"
 JES_ultranat_victory_desc:0 "Aquileians were no better than Francistrians. After fighting so hard to gain their freedom, Tarrinians would now rather die than give it away. They will accept no foreigner to rule over them, only a true, pure-blooded Tarrinian, whose young heart burns with passionate flame. Enemies of Tarrin beware! The eagle has broken free from its shackles."

 JES_move_capital_decision_desc:0 "At long last, we have reunited with Aquileia! Now we can move our government into its capital, for it is a far more fitting location for a Pan-Aquileian state than Tarrin is."
 
 JES_FRN_war_timer:0 "The War Of Independence"
 JES_FRN_war_timer_desc:0 "Francistrian propaganda, public statements and military strategies all predict a swift victory in Tarrin and a quick collapse of our "disorganized and decentralized" resistance. Should the conflict with Tarrin drag on, it will become clear to all that it is a war between nation-states instead of a counter-insurgency operation. At that point, public opinion and military leadership will demand the war in Tarrin to end."
 JES_recognition_from_others:0 "Request Diplomatic Recognition"

 ### Country Leader & General descriptions
 JES_leontina_desc:0 "Leontina Pandionne was born to a poor family of shepherds near the fortified town of Château Accueillant. Life in her small village was peaceful and quiet, and her conservative parents taught her to love her homeland of Tarrin. Even the republican revolution did not disturb her childhood, at least until Count Francis VIII decided to take advantage of the situation and invaded.\n\nLeontina's parents joined the local militia in the fight against the foreign invaders, but it was in vain. Her parents perished and her village was burned and looted by Francistrian soldiers. She fled into the hills that surrounded her home and barely survived in the wilds, until a group of republican resistance fighters found her and provided her with shelter and food.\n\nAfter Tarrin was annexed into the County of Francistria, Leontina's band of rebels joined the larger FLNT movement which was rapidly organizing in the region. Her fellow freedom fighters became her family, and she quickly learned to be useful to the resistance. At first her small size was beneficial in sabotage, and as she grew older she learned to use weapons and became skilled in setting up ambushes.\n\nAs she fought against the occupiers, her heart was filled with purpose: She had to avenge her parents and drive out the foreign invaders. Her upbringing meant she was familiar with the countryside and traditional Tarrinian values, and thus could easily recruit peasants to join the ranks of FLNT.\n\nIf FLNT achieves its goal of independence, she feels obliged to participate in the elections, as if it was her responsibility to protect Tarrin and its culture. She is especially popular among the peasantry of Tarrin."
 JES_meinard_desc:0 "When the Aquileian revolution broke out in 980, it was Meinard Nocère who led the uprising in Tarrin against the despotic Discret Countess. It was him who ordered the execution of the tyrant by guillotine. It was him who was the first President of the Republic of Tarrin, preparing her homeland for joining the Aquileian Republic. It was him who led the desperate struggle against Count Francis VIII and his forces. It was him who fled into the hills and founded the FLNT, even as the revolution crumbled around him.\n\nMeinard's status among Tarrinians is close to mythical. For the longest time, most did not even know if he was alive anymore, or merely a story older Tarrinians told, about a hero who would one day miraculously liberate Tarrin from foreign oppression. For a long time, even the Governor-General Vittorio Felice was unsure about the fate of Meinard.\n\nNow that FLNT has declared Tarrin's independence, Meinard has come out of hiding and revealed himself, leaving Tarrinians in awe and Francistrians in shock. Its as if he had risen from the dead to stand aside the griffons of Tarrin as they broke their chains once more.\n\nMeinard has close ties to the main republican movement in Aquileia, and especially to Théodore Vérany. He was born in Aquileia, but in his eyes Aquileians and Tarrinians are kinfolk with shared heritage. He has spent so many years fighting for Tarrin's freedom that no one cares where he comes from and most Tarrinians consider him a true national hero of Tarrin."
 JES_corina_desc:0 "Corina Trasviraire, commonly known as Colonel Corina, is an eccentric figure. Coming from a humble background, she joined the Royal Army Academy of Tarrin, but betrayed her superiors and joined the revolutionaries in 980. During the first Tarrinian elections, she founded AST, a socialist nationalist party, despite still being fairly young and inexperienced at the time.\n\nShe is strongly religious and nationalistic, yet is without a doubt a devout socialist. She advocates republican rule, yet is known for her authoritarian tendencies within the party. Due to leading a group of dissident officers who rebelled against the County, the republicans had a difficult time trusting her. Yet over the years, she slowly gained the trust she deserved by bravely fighting against the Francistrian invaders and organizing both passive and active resistance to occupation. At the same time, her popularity has grown among the citizens of Tarrin.\n\nReclusive, irrational and impulsive, yet also naive, intelligent and pious. To this day, Corina remains a controversial figure, but none doubt that she genuinely cares about the liberation of Tarrin and its inhabitants."
 
 ### Events
 tarrin.1.t:0 "[FRN.GetNameDef] Invades!"
 tarrin.1.d:0 "Our former oppressor, the [FRN.GetAdjective] government, has not recognized our declaration of independence and has mobilized their army. Their units are beginning to cross the border at this very moment. The foreign tyrants and slavers wish to extinguish the flame of our freedom before it truly gets to shine!\n\nWe will do everything possible to fight for our hard-earned liberty, but it might not be enough in the face of [FRN.GetAdjective] military might. Our only hope might lie in the west, in our Aquileian cousins. They did not come to our aid in 980s, but perhaps they will do so now, to redeem their lost honour and to prevent Tarrin from falling once again into possession of non-Aquileians."
 tarrin.1.a:0 "Seek aid from Aquileia!"
 tarrin.1.b:0 "We are on our own. Prepare for battle!"
 
 tarrin.2.t:0 "Tarrin Calls For Aid!"
 tarrin.2.d:0 "Tarrin, a region that was once a subject of Aquileia, recently declared independence as the freedom fighters of FLNT expelled the [FRN.GetAdjective] garrison. However, now the [FRN.GetAdjective] has been mobilized to retake the region and crush the resistance. The republican guerillas are now asking for us to come to their aid, so the region does not once again fall under foreign domination. While we may have ideological differences with the FLNT, should we simply stand by as our cousins are slaughtered by the lackeys of Wingbardy? If we do so, it might motivate Wingbardy to intervene as well, and escalate this into a large-scale conflict. We must be cautious."
 tarrin.2.a:0 "And Aquileia will answer!"
 tarrin.2.b:0 "We refuse to cooperate with terrorists of FLNT."
 
 tarrin.3.t:0 "Aquileia Abandons Us!"
 tarrin.3.d:0 "Unfortunately, our calls for aid have fallen on deaf ears, and the Aquileians refuse to come to our aid, leaving us to face the invader alone. We are outnumbered and outmatched, but we will not abandon hope! Our resistance hasn't faltered in the face of impossible odds before, and it shall not falter now. We will have to hold on as long as possible, so the enemy morale will falter and they will seek peace. Fight on, sons and daughters of Tarrin! Do not let the fire of freedom be extinguished so easily!"
 tarrin.3.a:0 "We will fight to the last griffon!"
 
 tarrin.4.t:0 "[FRN.GetNameDef] Retreats From Tarrin!"
 tarrin.4.d:0 "After months of bloodshed and desperate fighting, it seems the [FRN.GetAdjective] forces are pulling out of Tarrin. They expected a quick campaign and were unprepared for a full-scale war that lasted for this long. As such, they've had to retreat and enter the negotiation table with us. A cease-fire has been signed, and our independence secured, at least for now. The crisis is over and democratic elections for who shall lead the nation will soon be held.\n\nThe time for nation-wide celebration has come as we have boldly defeated our former oppressors! Tarrinians will never again be slaves to any foreign despot!"
 tarrin.4.a:0 "Vive le Tarrin! Vive la liberté!"
 
 tarrin.5.t:0 "Reunion"
 tarrin.5.d:0 "It was wise for the three leading figures of FLNT to never gather together in one place, so the leadership of the movement could never be eliminated in a single ambush. Therefore they almost never met each other, communicating exclusively with encrypted letters and telegrams, staying hidden and separate for as long as was needed.\n\nNow, they no longer had to hide like rats, or fear Francistrian agents spying their moves. They could meet freely, though just in case they still met in their secret underground headquarters. Meinard Nocère was already waiting there as Leontina Pandionne and Corina Trasviraire arrived, peacefully smoking a pipe and observing drafted military plans on the table. Leontina came first. The young freedom fighter bowed in respect.\n"Ah, little Leontina, good to see you!" Meinard said with a smile. "You've become a true adult since we last met."\n"It's been a while, hasn't it?" She replied. "My entire life I've spent fighting against the barbarians. To think it could soon be over..."\n"Let us not be so optimistic just yet. We still have to secure our independence."\nNext Corina entered the room, saluting Meinard like a soldier, her face stone-cold and serious.\n"You can drop the act, Corina, it's just the three of us here."\nCorina's expression became warmer and she let out a hearty chuckle, then sat down. "I wish I could drop the act when I am around my soldiers. There is no reason to be serious when we should rejoice instead!"\n"Not yet. It would be premature."\nCorina smirked. "And here I thought you were the optimist. What's the matter?"\n"Francistria may yet send their army to 'pacify' Tarrin. Aquileia may not recognize our independence.

Many of them lack food or water, or are either sickly or injured. Long wagon caravans clog up the roads, making it difficult to supply our military forces.\n\nRefugees are reporting about atrocities committing about Tarrinians, as well as forced expulsions and seizure of property. Some of the Tarrinians were treated even worse than the colonists, being regarded as heinous traitors.\n\nNow the government has to do what it can to take care of all these homeless, desperate refugees, straining its resources and distracting from any efforts to pacify Tarrin."

Meinard sighed wistfully, somehow knowing deep inside it wouldn't last.\n\nThere was a creaking sound as Leontina Pandionne opened the door to the balcony. "Ah, there you are, Marshal. I was looking for you."\nMeinard blew out smoke from his beak. "Oh yes, you wanted to meet. What's the matter, little Leontina?"\nShe sat down on a chair next to him, took in a deep breath as if preparing to fly off a cliff, and spoke. "Marshal, do you still... intend to cooperate with the Aquileians?"\n"With the republicans? Why yes, of course. They are our close friends. Their cause is our cause."\n"But their cause is doomed to fail, I fear. And even if it didn't, why should we still consider them friends? Where was Aquileia when the barbarians invaded?"\nMeinard frowned, and inhaled smoke from his pipe. "They were busy securing their own revolution. Besides, Francistria was allied with Wingbardy. They couldn't risk a war with them."\nLeontina pouted. "Or maybe they don't care for Tarrin and its independence. Do you still intend for Tarrin to become part of Aquileia? Just throw away the hard-fought freedom we've earned?"\nThe older griffon seemed increasingly uncomfortable. "Well, we'd still be free being part of an Aquileian Republic, just not sovereign. For me, it's democracy that truly matters."\nLeontina stood up and grimaced. "So it's as I feared. Your mind is set, I can tell, but I cannot agree with that." She placed a claw on her chest. "By Boreas, I am a Tarrinian, not an Aquileian!"\nMeinard set aside his pipe. "Little Leontina, please, calm down-"\n"I've now made my decision. I will run for President, and if I win, I will make sure Tarrin remains truly free. I'd rather die than live again in slavery!"

However, it turned out she was just preparing the publication of a book she had written during his time as a resistance fighter. Now, it was released across the nation and copies were given out freely to commoners in towns and villages. Of course, many citizens remained illiterate, but those that weren't could read the book out loud to others.\n\nThe book was simply called "The Blue Book". It was relatively short, written personally by Corina and meant to be read by everyone in Tarrin. It outlined Corina's own political views and her plans for the future, if she will be elected President.\n\nThe book condemned capitalism, but also communism, and curiously also denounced political parties, parliaments and constitutions. Instead, it advocated socialism, direct democracy and nationalism. Instead of a parliament, Tarrin should have a system of popular committees and conferences so power is not delegated to a ruling minority. It called for the abolishment of wage labour, elimination of exploitation and devolution of the state. She emphasised the importance of family, equality and freedom of speech.\n\nIn an interview with a reporter for a newly-founded Tarrin newspaper, Meinard Nocère called the book "a bunch of nonsense" and expressed his disappointment with Corina running for Presidency, saying it makes the nation more divided than it should be."

Leontina knew she'd have to beat her face-to-face in a debate to prove herself as a superior candidate.\n\nCorina accepted the invitation to a debate and soon enough the two met on stage in Griffoble, their speech being broadcast by radio so Tarrinians across the country could listen to it.\nAfter short and formal introductions, Leontina opened the debate proper. "First of all, I want to say that I've read your book, just so we're clear. And while I have tremendous respect for you as a resistance fighter, I found many things to disagree with in this tome. And to be frank, some of it is just strange. You condemn representative democracy, yet are trying to get elected President?"\nCorina shrugged with her characteristic, laid back smirk. "Well, can't reform representative democracy into something else without becoming President first, you know? I might be a revolutionary, but I only overthrow monarchical regimes, not democratic ones."\n"Hmpf, fair enough. But you also advocate for socialism. Don't you know socialism as an economic system cannot work?"\nCorina almost burst out laughing. "Hah, everygriff knows true socialism hasn't been tried yet."\n"And these conferences and committees, they sound borderline anarchical. How can Tarrin be strong and united if it is made so internally divided?"\n"You know, you're doing pretty well in a debate for someone so young," Corina said with a warm smile. "I'm impressed, you have a fiery spirit and I respect that. But in debates it is usually polite to let the other side speak freely instead of just bombarding them with critique."\nLeontina was taken aback and stuttered with her speech. "O-oh, right. My apologies."\n\nThe debate continued long into the afternoon, with both sides making good points."

Many of the older Tarrinians felt nostalgic for the last election day in 980, while the younger ones were eager to finally have their voices be heard. As the country was in need of both a head of state and a parliament, it was a dual election of sorts, with both votes being held simultaneously. The three main contenders for political positions were RTA, a Tarrinian-Aquileian republican party led by Meinard Nocère, PNT, a relatively young nationalist party whose figurehead was Leontina Pandionne, and AST, the old socialist party whose leader had always been Corina Trasviraire. It was quite likely that the party that would win a majority would also get their candidate voted President, so most Tarrinians treated both elections as one.\n\nVoter turnout was even higher than it had been in 980, and counting began as soon as the ballots were closed. All of Tarrin held its breath and eagerly awaited to hear the results being revealed on the radio, as it would decide the fate of the nation itself. Despite stark differences between the policies of the three parties, the country was peaceful as its griffons respected the democratic process. Whatever the results may be, they will be accepted by all three parties and their leaders."

Tarrin was once a County subject to the Discret monarchy, but the Count was overthrown in 980. Already back then, Meinard Nocère won the elections and wished to join the fellow revolutionaries in Aquila, but before that could be done, the Francistrians invaded.\n\nNow at last, after so many years of separation, Tarrin can rejoin the fatherland!"

With the foreign occupiers expelled, the building once more became the personal quarters of the President of Tarrin.\n\nCorina Trasviraire, however, was still not content with the building's status. As she explored its luxurious halls, she thought of what could be sold off or melted into ingots. In her mind, the entire building would have to be repurposed, either into a meeting place of popular committees, or a museum dedicated to the revolution. She had little interest in living in such a spacious and extravagant place. But for now, it would have to suffice.\n\nShe opened a door and entered a conference room, where Meinard Nocère and Leontina Pandionne were already waiting. As she sat down, Meinard smirked. "How typical of you to be late for your own meeting."\nCorina shrugged and rested her paws on the table. "Had a look around the place, I'm still not familiar with it. In any case, I did want to talk with you two. You lost the presidential race, and I know that you disagree with my plans for Tarrin. Which makes me question if you still wish to remain loyal to the Republic."\nLeontina rolled her eyes, while Meinard chuckled. "Of course. No matter what happens, we three are bound by blood and oaths of loyalty to one another."\n"At least you're not willing to simply let go of our sovereignty," Leontina said to Corina, glancing at Meinard.\n"Good, good. Our personal disagreements are secondary to national unity. Besides, it'd be a shame to lose such talented military leaders."\n"Flattery won't win our undying loyalty," Leontina said. "But if you prove that you know what you're doing and make Tarrin prosper, I don't see a reason to oppose you in any way."\n"Agreed," Meinard said.

It felt like coming back home after all this time. This had been his home and headquarters during his last Presidency, which had been short-lived. Much had changed since then, and he could see how the Francistrians had stripped it of many valuable artworks, bringing them all to their own country. Yet much had remained untouched, and it still had an aura of luxury and prosperity, which had once been exclusive to the Discrets alone.\n\nHe opened a door and entered a conference room, where he had arranged a meeting with two of his most trusted comrades, Corina Trasviraire and Leontina Pandionne. He sat down, took out his pipe and lit it with a match. It had been too long since he had last smoked in this room. He could remember it like it was yesterday.\n\nSoon, Leontina entered, on time as usual. She was a good soldier, obedient yet confident, knowing in her heart what had to be done. Meinard simply nodded in greeting, and she nodded back as she sat down. Some time later, Corina came, late as always. Yet Meinard did not mind. It was simply Corina's habit, and nothing could change it.\n"It is unreal that we are now gathered here in this room, but sometimes dreams can become reality," Meinard said. "Yet our work is far from over. The evil work of the occupier must be undone, the nation healed. And most importantly, Aquileia must be saved from the claws of the Discrets."\n"We must strike against the monarchist scum immediately!" Corina almost shouted, slamming her clawed fist on the table.\n"Patience, Corina. We are too weak to do so. Preparations need to be made, or our independence will be as short-lived as last time."\n"You are putting Tarrin at risk if you plan to topple the Kingdom," Leontina muttered.

It is possible they receive foreign support from monarchist supporters in Aquileia and possibly from Francistria as well, though these claims have not been fully confirmed. Whatever the case, they are conducting terrorist attacks across the country, bombing government buildings and officials, as well as spreading pro-monarchist and anti-republican propaganda.

However, doing so would also likely anger some Francistrians, who may still think that Tarrin is a rightful part of their nation.

Some accused Corina of trying to seize power for herself, but she assured them new, more democratic governmental bodies would replace the parliament.\n\nAnd so the parliament gathered for the first time since 980, only for it to be the final time as well. Speeches were spoken and a vote was held, and in the end a majority of the parliament agreed for it to be disbanded permanently, and replaced with the General National Congress, a vastly expanded legislature with 3000 representatives of regional Basic Congresses.

Instead, she wished for the promotion of Aquileian language and culture. Schools would now become bilingual, teaching both Aquileian and Tarrinian. Francistrian had already been removed from the curriculum entirely.\n\nThe Popular Congresses complied, starting a cultural revolution of sorts where anything seen as "foreign" was removed from society. No compensation was offered to those who were expulsed and stripped of property. Corina saw this as justified, saying that it would cover "the cost of the occupation". Tarrinian populace celebrated the event on the streets, burning effigies of Governor-General Vittorio and Count Francis VIII. The flags of the Griffonian Empire, Aquileian monarchy, Francistria and Wingbardy were spread out on the pavement, then walked over by a griffon carrying the flag of Tarrin, and finally burned into ashes.\n\nThe Congresses later made the celebration annual, calling it "Vengeance Day".

A great, final struggle is at claw against the forces of reaction, and I ask you, fellow citizens of the sovereign Republic of Tarrin, to stand by my side in my final crusade against evil. Because without you, I am nothing."\nThe audience immediately ruptured into cheering, with griffons raising their fists high in the air and shouting oaths of eternal loyalty to the Republic. Meinard couldn't help but smile."

 tarrin.32.t:0 "Resurgent Republican Resistance"
 tarrin.32.d:0 "Our internal security officers have reported about a worrisome development: There has been a drastic increase in underground resistance activity of the revolutionary republican movement. It seems they have been reinvigorated and resupplied by the republicans of Tarrin, which recently broke free from Francistria.\n\nThe secret service has already been ordered to deal with the internal security threat, while we should focus on quashing the external threat of Tarrin. The flames of revolution must be extinguished once and for all."
 tarrin.32.a:0 "We'll deal with them soon enough."
