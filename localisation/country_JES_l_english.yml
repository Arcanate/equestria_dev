 ### Country Leader & General descriptions
 JES_leontina_desc:0 "Leontina Pandionne was born to a poor family of shepherds near the fortified town of Château Accueillant. Life in her small village was peaceful and quiet, and her conservative parents taught her to love her homeland of Tarrin. Even the republican revolution did not disturb her childhood, at least until Count Francis VIII decided to take advantage of the situation and invaded.\n\nLeontina's parents joined the local militia in the fight against the foreign invaders, but it was in vain. Her parents perished and her village was burned and looted by Francistrian soldiers. She fled into the hills that surrounded her home and barely survived in the wilds, until a group of republican resistance fighters found her and provided her with shelter and food.\n\nAfter Tarrin was annexed into the County of Francistria, Leontina's band of rebels joined the larger FLNT movement which was rapidly organizing in the region. Her fellow freedom fighters became her family, and she quickly learned to be useful to the resistance. At first her small size was beneficial in sabotage, and as she grew older she learned to use weapons and became skilled in setting up ambushes.\n\nAs she fought against the occupiers, her heart was filled with purpose: She had to avenge her parents and drive out the foreign invaders. Her upbringing meant she was familiar with the countryside and traditional Tarrinian values, and thus could easily recruit peasants to join the ranks of FLNT.\n\nAfter FLNT achieved their goal of independence, she felt obliged to participate in the elections, as if it was her responsibility to protect Tarrin and its culture. She is especially popular among the peasantry of Tarrin."

 ### Events
 tarrin.1.t:0 "[FRN.GetNameDef] Invades!"
 tarrin.1.d:0 "Our former oppressor, the [FRN.GetAdjective] government, has not recognized our declaration of independence and has mobilized their army. Their units are beginning to cross the border at this very moment. The foreign tyrants and slavers wish to extinguish the flame of our freedom before it truly gets to shine!\n\nWe will do everything possible to fight for our hard-earned liberty, but it might not be enough in the face of [FRN.GetAdjective] military might. Our only hope might lie in the west, in our Aquileian cousins. They did not come to our aid in 980s, but perhaps they will do so now, to redeem their lost honour and to prevent Tarrin from falling once again into possession of non-Aquileians."
 tarrin.1.a:0 "Seek aid from Aquileia!"
 tarrin.1.b:0 "We are on our own. Prepare for battle!"
 
 tarrin.2.t:0 "Tarrin Calls For Aid!"
 tarrin.2.d:0 "Tarrin, a region that was once a subject of Aquileia, recently declared independence as the freedom fighters of FLNT expelled the [FRN.GetAdjective] garrison. However, now the [FRN.GetAdjective] has been mobilized to retake the region and crush the resistance. The republican guerillas are now asking for us to come to their aid, so the region does not once again fall under foreign domination. While we may have ideological differences with the FLNT, should we simply stand by as our cousins are slaughtered by the lackeys of Wingbardy?"
 tarrin.2.a:0 "And Aquileia will answer!"
 tarrin.2.b:0 "We refuse to cooperate with terrorists of FLNT."
 
 tarrin.3.t:0 "Aquileia Abandons Us!"
 tarrin.3.d:0 "Unfortunately, our calls for aid have fallen on deaf ears, and the Aquileians refuse to come to our aid, leaving us to face the invader alone. We are outnumbered and outmatched, but we will not abandon hope! Our resistance hasn't faltered in the face of impossible odds before, and it shall not falter now. Fight on, sons and daughters of Tarrin! Do not let the fire of freedom be extinguished so easily!"
 tarrin.3.a:0 "We will fight to the last griffon!"
 
 tarrin.4.t:0 "[FRN.GetNameDef] Retreats From Tarrin!"
 tarrin.4.d:0 "After months of bloodshed and desperate fighting, it seems the [FRN.GetAdjective] forces are pulling out of Tarrin. They expected a quick campaign and were unprepared for a full-scale war that lasted for this long. As such, they've had to retreat and enter the negotiation table with us. A cease-fire has been signed, and our independence secured, at least for now. The crisis is over and democratic elections for who shall lead the nation will soon be held.\n\nThe time for nation-wide celebration has come as we have boldly defeated our former oppressors! Tarrinians will never again be slaves to any foreign despot!"
 tarrin.4.a:0 "Vive la Tarrin! Vive la liberté!"
