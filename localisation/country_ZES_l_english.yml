ZES_collect_old_friends:0 "Gather Old Friends"
ZES_collect_old_friends_desc:0 "Pasarinha has made many friends in his years of doing business in Kása and beyond.

ZES_aid_from_above:0 "A Boa Causa"
ZES_aid_from_above_desc:0 "Pasarinha is an advocate of the free market through and through, but the Barrad crisis is something beyond what Kása has faced before.

ZES_education_campaign:0 "Re-Educate the Refugees"
ZES_education_campaign_desc:0 "The Barrad refugees are, unfortunately, lacking in both educational and practical skills.

ZES_resettle_refugees:0 "The Home Plan"
ZES_resettle_refugees_desc:0 "Currently, the refugees make their homes in the rural border regions in government-sponsored camps.

ZES_entrepenerial_advancement_desc:0 "Many among the refugees are bright minds waiting to be unleashed, we can offer sizeable grants to those who want to make their mark on Kásan society through their own intuition and skills.

ZES_rethink_capitalism_desc:0 "Capitalism has gone through a lot of changes as an ideology over its history.

Pasarinha believes in a new kind of capitalism, with true freedom for all to pursue their dreams, and it shall now be implemented."

ZES_avoid_skyfall:0 "Look to Skyfall's Mistakes"
ZES_avoid_skyfall_desc:0 "Skyfall is the prime example of corrupted capitalism, a land of filthy oligarchs and demonic corporations. While Pasarinha has immense trust in the ideas he believes in, others may look on Skyfall's system as a way to make money. The First Commander must ensure this never happens."

ZES_increased_taxation:0 "Increase the Tax Rate"
ZES_increased_taxation_desc:0 "Pasarinha's reforms are ambitious, and ambition generally requires funds.

ZES_cement_council_support:0 "Cement Council Support"
ZES_cement_council_support_desc:0 "There are many likeminded councillors that Pasarinha can court to achieve his goals, but many do not fully trust the businesszebra.

ZES_parlay_with_lua:0 "Parlay with Lûa"
ZES_parlay_with_lua_desc:0 "As Mansu Erba's protege, Lûa still holds an air of prestige and power within the council. Working with him would provide us more support for our more ambitious reforms, and grant our regime legitimacy as the successor to the Avo's."

ZES_fresh_business_perspectives:0 "Novas Perspectivas"
ZES_fresh_business_perspectives_desc:0 "Research and development is more important than almost anything else, and Pasarinha can see this.

This is essential to both our economy and our national defense."

ZES_denounce_extremism:0 "Denounce Extremist Ideals"
ZES_denounce_extremism_desc:0 "Extremism has no place in Kása! We are a proud democracy, and nothing shall stop that! While Pasarinha is more of an economics zebra than one for politics, he recognizes the importance of denouncing extremism so that Kása maintains its course as a proud democracy."

ZES_no_trade_barriers:0 "No Trade Barriers"
ZES_no_trade_barriers_desc:0 "We lack many of the natural resources and the industrial capacity of many of the larger powers. Still, by opening ourselves up to more foreign trade, we can hopefully achieve higher industrial output and acquire what we need to boost our economy to new heights."

ZES_abandon_gold_standard_desc:0 "The idea that gold and other precious materials have intrensic value has held economics back for hundreds of years, it is now our job to take the final step to end this system.

ZES_chamber_of_commerce:0 "Câmara do Comércio"
ZES_chamber_of_commerce_desc:0 "Pasarinha may be an intelligent Zebra, but he can not do all his work alone. Establishing an advisory council of industrialists and wealthy Zebras of Kása will allow us to always have creatures to consult for economic advice. Also, if any of these creatures would have tried to get influence through more "illicit" means, they now may think twice, since they already have someone to listen to their concerns."

ZES_examine_situation:0 "Expandir Prudutu Projektu"
ZES_examine_situation_desc:0 "Pasarinha's Prudutu Projektu has been at work for many years developing Kása's indsutrial sector and expanding industrial capabilities.

### Pre-Election Events ###
kasa.1.t:0 "The Last Convention"
kasa.1.d:0 "As the delegates of the Advisory Council began to gather for the great meeting, there was a buzz of excitement throughout the air. All members of the council eagerly awaited Mansu Erba's 1007 yearly address, as she always had wise words on where their nation should be headed. Every one of them there knew that many problems still faced Kása, obstacles that none of the nation's founders could have foreseen so many years ago. But despite all these Kása remained strong, 50 years on from it's greatest challenge to date, the nation held firm under its Avo, it's Grandmother Mansu Erba.\n\nWhen the doors to the chamber opened all creatures in the room turned their heads. There stood Erba with her aid Lûa Ramedi, and as they entered, all rose. Erba shook many hooves as she made her way to the seat at the head of the circle of seats that formed the council. Being helped into her seat by Lûa, who then took his seat in the back of the room as he was not technically a member of the council. As this happened, all the other councilors took their seats and began to look endearingly upon their Avo.\n\nMansu Erba cleared her throat and said, "I do here declare, that the 1007 Advisory Council of Kása is opened."
kasa.1.a:0 "Hear hear!"

kasa.2.t:0 "Livru Programa"
kasa.2.d:0 "As the hall again fell to silence awaiting Erba's next remarks, she drew from her sachel a book.\n\n"I have carried this with me since my operation in Austurland in 957. It was given to me by a young pony who I, unfortunately, have not been able to track down in the years since. She had almost nothing to her name except this book and chose to give it to me as thanks. That meant it had to have some value to her. So when I first read it, I was surprised to find it was merely a book about plants found in Wingbardy far away. I really had no use for it, nor did the family I received it from, but I realised something from it; why that young pony and her family held it so dear. It was the idea of learning that is valuable to all beings. And this is a policy I have tried to build on. While I have had the honor to lead you all, we have made great strides in literacy for our nation. Libraries on wheels travel across the land, distributing books and instruction to all the people. Literacy should be a right that all our citizens are entitled to. So that we may all work towards a better, more educated future for Kása.""
kasa.2.a:0 "More books for everyone!"

kasa.3.t:0 "Xatisa Relief"
kasa.3.d:0 "As the clapping calmed down Mansu Erba's face became a grimace. Lûa could be seen looking down, expecting what was coming next.\n\n"Though this meeting would not be complete without adressing the problem at our northern border. For refugees continue to flee from tyranny from that accursed land. We are a nation of free beings dedicated to the idea that all creatures of the world should be free and possess the rights and freedoms we hold dear. With this, we are called to action to protect these ponies who flee from that wicked place called Barrad."\n\nThis drew reactions of support from the room, especially from councilor Yrmthu, an earth pony who herself was born to refugees.\n\nBut these cheers of support did little to lighten Erba's mood. She raised her hoof, quieting the crowd before continuing. "But in answering this call to action, I have failed. I did not act quick enough or decisive enough. For years now we have been supporting the refugees, and we have made some headway. Many now have jobs in our land and are creating homes and families for themselves. But many more are still struggling. While we may be able to support them, I have failed to find a way to create for them a new home. In this, I ask for your forgiveness."\n\nNow, Yrmthu spoke up; "Avo, no one is perfect. You could not have known what a struggle it would be for the nation to overcome this. My own parents could never have known what this nation would endure when they arrived here. Even I bear some responsibility, I most likely have not done enough either. No one has yet found a perfect solution, do not be so hard on yourself. We all must stand up and take this problem head-on. For the good of all the citizens of Kása.""
kasa.3.a:0 "It is a shared blame, Avo. . ."

kasa.4.t:0 "Prudutu Projektu"
kasa.4.d:0 "Mansu Erba clears her throat and gestures to the lights that hang from the ceiling of the council chamber. Nodding and smiling she begins to speak again.\n\n"Something I am proud that I have been able to do for this nation is moving our economy forward. It has been a team effort from all of us, but I believe I can finally make this declaration; Kása is beginning to enter the modern era step by step, and I for one could not be happier about it.\n\nApplause went up around the room, but were quickly hushed as Mansu gestured her hoof to the back of the chamber\n\n"And for all that I have someone to thank. Pasarinha." All eyes turned to the zebra at the back of the room, dressed in an old naval uniform and possessing a gruff stubble of facial hair, he nodded his head and smiled at the Avo di Kása. Erba groaned, rolled her eyes, and spoke again, "No! Get up here! We all know you love the spotlight and this is a moment well deserved" Pasarinha chuckled and began to move to the front of the room, he took off his hat and bowed before the rest of the Council, earning applause from all including Erba and Lûa.\n\nStarting again, Erba remarked "You have done incredible work for this nation. It is thanks to you the factories of Seguro are running with machinery we only heard tales of not too long ago. Your shipping routes have connected us to the rest of the world, and brought me closer to Kása.", Erba began to chuckle, "Nothing makes me happier than to speak to the citizens on the radio, where all can hear me. It does give me some stage freight, but I love it none the less. So thank you very much Pasarinha."\n\nThe room once again applauded as the former naval captain once again took his seat."
kasa.4.a:0 "Industrial progress is vital for our continue freedom!"

kasa.5.t:0 "Our Harpy  Kin in the South"
kasa.5.d:0 ""Now that local matters are behind us, it is time to move on to our affairs abroad. Tómas Riachuelo, please stand up."\n\nAlong the side of the room, a short, stout Harpy rises from his seat and waves his claw to those assembled.\n\n"I would like to thank you for the work you have done fostering the friendship between our two nations. We could not be more grateful for your assistance in these trying times. Thanks as well to the ever-helpful diplomat Silera Medu, who has been working with the ambassador"\n\nErba gestures to a tall, lanky zebra seated next to Tómas, much in contrast to the Harpy's stout frame.\n\n"You two have done great work in fostering the bond between our two nations." Now speaking to the room, "Macawia was our first ally in the battle against tyranny, and we are happy to still count them on that list. The Pact of 907 still stands firm in our minds, and we are proud of the partnership that has been developed here. We share each other's values, and we fight the same fight. While we struggle against the slavers and despots of this continent, Macawia battles the tyrants of Colthage, and in that struggle, we wish you the best."\n\nWith this the councilors cheer, and Erba walks to shake the Macawian Ambassador's claw. After the brief embrace, she takes her seat once more."
kasa.5.a:0 "To a continued friendship!"

kasa.6.t:0 "Beyond Our Borders"
kasa.6.d:0 ""While we do everything we can to secure the safety of our citizens within our nation. There are those nearby our borders who wish to do us harm."\n\nThe mood in the room becomes grim, councilor Yrmthu is visibly shaken and begins to knock her hoof on the floor, and many other councilors show similar agitation.\n\n"To our east lies Austurland. Whether we can count them among friends or foes seems to be up to their new Jarl, Ygritte. None of us can say for sure what type of person she is, so we must always be wary of her. To the west is Gryphus; as we speak, they hold a congress at Riaportu plotting their nation's next move. While their current regime is not aligned against us, we are not their friends." Erbu's speech becomes rash, "They would gladly wish for our citizens to be subjected to the will of their orders of knights and their ruthless corporations." The room stands in shock as Mansu Erba begins to cough, regaining her breath she raises a hoof to signal she does not needs help, calming herself she continues in a less rabid tone, "Gryphus does not stand for freedom. We can hope one day they may embrace these ideals, but until then, we must be on guard."\n\nPausing for a moment, Erba reads the room, her coughing fit has startled many, but she collects herself and begins again. "To our north lies the "nation" of Barrad. As I have already discussed, the treatment of their people is abominable and has caused many to flee into our nation's arms. I believe our policy should be this, wipe them from the continent one way or another." Councilors around the room nod, having forgotten about the health scare moments earlier, "Even farther north lies Wittenland and the River Coalition. While many of these nations have embraced the same freedom we have here in Kása, they still hold slavers and tyrants in their midst. We must be wary of a silver tongue backed up by iron chains. Our policy should be to not provoke these nations, as I believe we may one day be friends. But if the gaze of Wittenland or Nimbusia ever turns south. We must be prepared to protect ourselves with all our might and spirit.""
kasa.6.a:0 "Times are changing but the struggle continues on."

kasa.7.t:0 "First Commander's Final Statement"
kasa.7.d:0 ""Finally, before we break out and begin the nitty-gritty details out our national politics, I have a few more things to say to you all."\n\nThis comment draws the attention of the room, all present lean forward and wait with bated breath, and out of the corner of her eye, Yrmthu notices that Lûa is surprised as well. Whatever these remarks are, they must be important. The pony meets eyes with Pasarinha, who bares a stern look on his face. Yrmthu tries to stifle a gasp as she realises he has seen the same thing.\n\n"I have lead this nation for forty years. It is a part of me as much I am a part of it. You all call me the Avo behind my back, I know that, and I have learned to accept it. While thus far, I have talked about change, I now want of speak of things to remain the same. This Council has advised me for all my time as the First Commander. While its faces may have changed, its spirit is always the same. Democratic elections, limits on terms, it must remain a pillar of Kása for as long as this nation draws breath. Our laws have stayed the same in spirit, while we have needed to modernize them to the standards of the day, they must always try to protect those who may not be able to protect themselves, and guard the rights and liberties of all our citizens. This spirit must also remain the same."\n\nMansu Erba paused, taking a deep breath, she begins again, speaking in a more hushed tone, "Though I should not busy you all with too many words. For there is one more thing that needs some change in Kása...""
kasa.7.a:0 "Silence falls into the room. . ."

kasa.8.t:0 "The Sudden Announcement"
kasa.8.d:0 ""Me."\n\nThe single word reverberates around the room multiple times. All in attendance, ask themselves over and over if they had heard it correctly. Lûa stares at Erba, unable to think clearly. He stammers out a sentence, "But Avo we ne-" Erba cuts him short, "I am not to be Kása's Avo any longer. My health is waning, I am growing weaker, both of mind and of body. And we are entering an age of problems that I am just not prepared to face. These are the issues of steel and electricity, of modern politics and diplomacy. I can not lead you all any longer. I will work with the government to organize elections for a new First Commander, and then I shall be off to live the rest of my life. I have a husband to get back to, you know."\n\nThe shock finally sits in amongst all present, all those who were not seated already find somewhere to rest themselves. There are shaking heads and teary eyes all around the chamber, even the Macawian ambassador shows signs of emotion over this. Suddenly, Yrmthu rises and begins to speak, "But Mansu! This is so sudden! What if Kása is not ready for this!" Erbu smiles, "Of course Kása is ready. It has been my life's work to prepare it for a moment that I didn't even know would come. I know as well as all of you here that all First Commanders have led Kása for life. But I can not go on any longer. Sometimes, I believe I am the tiredest creature in the world." Mansu Erba sits calmly, and a moment of silence winds through the room, all the creatures in attendance realize she is genuine. And as Erba sees this, she goes on\n\n"Please, all of you, know that I have made this decision taking everything I can into account. I was elected in a crisis, and I have lived a crisis since then. I am looking forward to the day where I can wake up in my own home, and live my life as a mother and grandmother without the concerns of a nation weighing on my spirit. Believe me, I value highly the work I have done for this nation, and I am filled with joy to see its success, but I am still a mare, and I have things I would like to do with myself. You all shower me with praise for what I have done, but after today look upon me and see just another citizen of this nation we have worked together to build, another creature basking in the liberty and freedom that Kása grants to all who live within its borders. I know already many of you shall ask me for advice on how to preserve our nation and its traditions, so I shall address that now. As long as your hearts are interwoven with the spirit of freedom, and of liberty, then you have no need for the words of any single zebra, for you can simply listen to your own heart, and it may guide you to tomorrow. I have already given you my thoughts on the state of our nation today, if you wish for the last testament of my political life use that if you wish. But remember, while Kása may be a part of me, it is a part of all of you as well. Do not let any forces cloud that perception in your minds. Kása may be a nation, but it is also a spirit. And that spirit lives within all of us. Thank you."\n\nMansu Erba, A Avo di Kása, rises from her seat. Walking with a vitality she has not possessed in years, she leaves the Council hall and enters the passenger seat of a car. Beside her is her husband, and together they drive off to their country home."
kasa.8.a:0 "C-can she even do that? Oh Avo... What will happen now?"

pasakasa.1.a:0 "Friendship is valuable."

pasakasa.2.t:0 "A Question Answered"
pasakasa.2.d:0 "At the council meeting, a councillor asks Pasarinha what are his plans. The zebra then, very punctually, explains his vision of an urbanized Kása, centered around being a tradelink between Griffonia and Northern Zebrica, particularly with the River Federation in mind. This should draw ire from many councillors, who call out him on seeking profits over proper ideals. But Pasarinha would just ignore the calls, cleaning his pipe until the yelling dies down and then continues to a new topic."
pasakasa.2.a:0 "For good or bad, he has a clear vision."

pasakasa.3.t:0 "Jolly Evening Gathering"
pasakasa.3.d:0 "Event where Pasarinha hosts a social gathering for the most influential business owners in Kása. There, he holds a speech where he, initially, thanks them all for their recent efforts to aid the refugees. But he then would, slowly, start to chide key individuals present for trying to offer him bribes or who hold their money in Macawian accounts to avoid inspection by Kásan authorities. Pasarinha should showcase how things are faring in Skyfall, where the Iron Chancellor rules with a firm hoof over an oligarchy of the rich and criminals, where greed has left the common people starving. He then asks from those present if they wish to see such happen in Kása. Slowly, all present swear to never let greed cloud their vision."
pasakasa.3.a:0 "Tyranny of money will never be allowed in Kása."

pasakasa.4.t:0 "Unconventional Decision"
pasakasa.4.d:0 "Event where, another brandy and pipe filled everning, Pasarinha listens to his two friends argue over how to deal with the rising organisation within the workers. Harpy thinks they should form national unions so government can overseen them whereas the unicorn thinks the companies need to be enforced to take care of their workers. Pasarinha cuts off the argument by proposing a two-pronged approach; unions will be legalized as free entities as long as they vow to abide by democracy and the government will act as negotiator between the unions and companies to reach agreements at an annual basis."
pasakasa.4.a:0 "Compromise is the best medicine."

pasakasa.5.t:0 "Rethinking the Model"
pasakasa.5.d:0 "Event where Pasarinha is silently inspecting his notes at while smoking a pipe. The unicorn would enter and question him about the plans. Pasarinha would then meticulously explain how he imagines Kása's economy as three distinct sectors, build to not compete for quality workers nor in the internal market but orientated to provide good quality products for the international markets. Should carry over the same romantic tones from event 1."
pasakasa.5.a:0 "The plan is set."

pasakasa.6.t:0 "The Essence of Kása"
pasakasa.6.d:0 "Event where Pasarinha holds a speech in the Advisory Council. He speaks about how life has improved and the economical growth that has occured so far. But also says it is not enough yet. He shares his vision of Kása interlocked in the global market and vibrant trade cities where goods between the continents flow through. This time, unlike before, no one yells back at him. At the end, he vows that this Kása will be build."
pasakasa.6.a:0 "Onwards, Kása!"

pasakasa.7.t:0 "Old Friends"
pasakasa.7.d:0 "Event where Pasarinha and the Macawian ambassador Tómas Riachuelo hold a public meeting by the marooned D´Vash, where they jointly declare the continued friendship and cooperation between the two nations, citing the shared past and love for democracy.

pasakasa.12.a:0 "Work time!"

pasakasa.13.t:0 "Interesting Proposition"
pasakasa.13.d:0 "Event where Pasarinha is presented with a tourism plan by the harpy. Target would be middle-class Macawian tourists initially and then potentially ponies from the River Coalition areas or even far-away Equestria. Pasarinha should be bit weirded of the plan but should be convinced when the unicorn chips in and points out how Kása is littered with ruined castles and untouched rural lands, perfect places to market."
pasakasa.13.a:0 "An idea well sold."

pasakasa.14.t:0 "Exotic Holiday"
pasakasa.14.d:0 "Flavour event depicting a Macawian harpy family in to Kása on a package trip. Full creative freedom for the writer but should reference potential trips to see old Wittenlandic castles, the nature reserveration in Bymnonia or the boulevards of Seguro (essentially the tourists destinations the player builds in previous focuses)."
pasakasa.14.a:0 "An unforgettable holiday."

pasakasa.15.t:0 "Usual Work Day"
pasakasa.15.d:0 "Narrative final event for Pasarinha's usual workday is interrupted when he is cordially invited to a dinner by his unicorn friend. He would protest a bit that he is far too busy and has an important meeting at the Chamber of Commerce that same day but his speech would be interrupted by a kiss from the mare. After she's left, he would buzz an aide and inform that today's meetings are postponed due to a cold."

ZES_xatisa:0 "Xatisa"
ZES_xatisa_desc:0 "Xatisa (The Trouble) refers to the ongoing refugee crisis from the northern ‘realm’ of Barrad. These ponies, originally from Wittenland, are near-all former serfs, have no real place to go and take considerable amount of resources from the Free State’s economy.

ZES_military_blocked:0 "Outdated Military Formation"
ZES_military_blocked_desc:0 "Even before its formal foundation, Kása has relied upon citizen-militia to form the backbone of national defence. Only a small cadre of officers —trained in Macawia's military academies— are considered professional soldiers while a foreign legion funded by Macawia augments the local defence forces. This ad-hoc system is not capable of meeting the demands of modern warfare and recent reforms by Mansu Erba have considelated smaller regional units to formal garrison forces, forming the first permanent ground forces in Kása's history.\n\nEven then, Kása, formally at least, has no official standing army and this limits the government's authority in raising any new forces."

### Diplomatic ideas
ZES_gryphus_trade_zone:0 "Kása-Gryphus Trade Zone"
ZES_gryphus_trade_zone_desc:0 "An agreement between Kása and Gryphus has led to formation of a free-trade zone where goods and commodities can pass between the two nations freely without any tariffs to the benefit of both countries."

mansu_erba_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 7th May 931 in Seguro\n\n§YBiography§!:Born second child to a farmer family, Mansu Erba grew in the vast farmlands just outside the capital Seguro, spending her youth exploring nature. Unlike her peers, she and her siblings received basic education from their parents, learning to read and write. As Mansu’s elder brother would inherit the farm, she had to find life elsewhere and so Mansu left for the capital, to live and work at a shop owned by relatives. However, this life was not to be as she enlisted in 950 in a Macawian military program which she graduated from in 954. As a sub-teniente, her cleverness earned her the attention of the Skapatoria Programa.\n\nFor three years, she worked as an undercover agent in Austurland, Wittenland and Nimbusia, where she helped many escaping to freedom. Mansu proved herself to be a capable operative and in 957, she rose to fame for her actions in Austurland as she lead the escape of over a hundred thralls despite taking a musket ball to her gut. She received a hero’s welcome at Seguro and an award for her self-sacrifice from the First Commander. Sadly, the musket ball that made her a hero also prevented her from ever working as an operative again. At the hospital, the recovering zebra would meet her future husband, a widowed doctor, and the two would be married two years later. In 960 the Advisory Council elections saw Mansu chosen as a councillor of Seguro.\n\nWhile Kása had continued to prosper, in 967 the Barrad Crisis erupted. As streams of refugees trickled into Kása, the First Commander of the time suffered a stroke. As the crisis worsened, an emergency election in the council saw Mansu Erba narrowly elected as the First Commander. She acted swiftly, diverting all funds from industrialisation programs and appealing to Macawia for aid. Kása suffered from it but it endured, their founding ideals upheld as Mansu argued to the critics. After all, is a factory worth betraying oneself?\n\nDespite the hardships in the following decades, Kása chose to trust in its timely hero and under Mansu’s leadership, Kása slowly recovered from the crisis thanks to extensive literacy and economic reform programs. Now, she is known as A avo di Kása —Kása’s Grandmother.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Printik"

ZES_solano_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: December 16th, 965, Ilha Rosca\n\n§YBiography§!:Born to a zebra mother and a pony father, Solano Lobu was born in interesting times. Two years after his birth, the Barrad crisis erupted in Kása. Lobu's father, a low-level government worker, was swamped with work and didn't get to spend much time with his son. Constantly advocating for assisting the refugees, showing charity, and doing everything he could to improve their lives. So, Solano spent most of his early years with his mother. She was a proud citizen and instilled in him an admiration for all those doing their part to serve the freedom Kása offered to all, including his father.\n\nIn order to follow on this legacy, Solano signed up for military training in Macawia, hoping to return and serve his nation proudly. After his stint at a Macawian military academy, where he performed excellently, he returned to his home of Ilha Rosca and became its local militia coordinator. He was happy with his domestic service, but little did he know, people higher up had their eyes on him.\n\nIn 991, Mansu Erba tapped the local commander to begin organizing the national network of militias in Kása into something that could be called an army. Solano accepted this duty, and continues his work to this day. While having little combat experience, he is a master organizer and logistician, and hopes with all his heart that his work can benefit his proud nation in some way.\n\n§CHis father is very proud of him.§!\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Sesek"

ZES_wojtek_desc:0 "§gDepending from where in the world does one hail, bears are either simple animals or a race of arrogant warriors. There are exceptions of course, but Wojtek is unique even among those.\n\n Little is known of his past, and the bear himself is unwilling to tell. This and countless rumors, have turned Wojtek into somewhat of a pseudo-mythical figure. What is known is that Wojtek is a Gryphussian brown bear, a species hunted by Opinicus knights for sport. When he was but a cub, Wojtek lost his mother to Opinicus hunters and would have been slain himself, but was saved by Gryphussian partisans from Kasa.This band of guerrillas adopted the bear, giving him the name "Wojtek". However, during an engagement, the bear was separated from the unit.\n\nYears later griffon refugees in Kasa would start telling strange stories of a bear who would protect Gryphussians fleeing the Free Towns. Similar tales would come from partisans who claimed a great ursine was slaying their enemies with a cannon it wielded as if it was a mere rifle. The leadership of Kasa would remain sceptical however, until the so called "Liberator Bear" himself arrived into Kasa one day. He introduced himself as Wojtek and pledged to fight for the Kasa Free State in order to help liberating the Gryphussians - his nation and saving the brown bears - his species .\n\nWhile initially reluctantly accepted into the Kasan military as a private, Wojtek was quickly promoted into the position of corporal and eventually into the ranks of generals, due to physical ability, mental fortitude, unexpected expertise in artillery and surprisingly for a such a predator - great care for soldiers serving under him.\n\nWojtek now stands as one of the lesser unifying figures of Gryphussians in Kasa, who now believe that liberation of their homeland is at hand as even it’s nature is turning against it’s oppressors.§!"
