### Pre-Election Events ###
kasa.1.t:0 "The Last Convention"
kasa.1.d:0 "As the delegates of the Advisory Council began to gather for the great meeting, there was a buzz of excitement throughout the air. All members of the council eagerly awaited Mansu Erba's 1007 yearly address, as she always had wise words on where their nation should be headed. Every one of them there knew that many problems still faced Kása, obstacles that none of the nation's founders could have foreseen so many years ago. But despite all these Kása remained strong, 50 years on from it's greatest challenge to date, the nation held firm under its Avo, it's Grandmother Mansu Erba.\n\nWhen the doors to the chamber opened all creatures in the room turned their heads. There stood Erba with her aid Luâ Ramedi, and as they entered, all rose. Erba shook many hooves as she made her way to the seat at the head of the circle of seats that formed the council. Being helped into her seat by Luâ, who then took her seat in the back of the room as she was not technically a member of the council. As this happened, all the other councilors took their seats and began to look endearingly upon their Avo.\n\nMansu Erba cleared her throat and said, "I do here declare, that the 1007 Advisory Council of Kása is opened."
kasa.1.a:0 "Hear hear!"

kasa.2.t:0 "Livru Programa"
kasa.2.d:0 "As the hall again fell to silence awaiting Erba's next remarks, she drew from her sachel a book.\n\n"I have carried this with me since my operation in Austurland in 957. It was given to me by a young pony who I, unfortunately, have not been able to track down in the years since. She had almost nothing to her name except this book and chose to give it to me as thanks. That meant it had to have some value to her. So when I first read it, I was surprised to find it was merely a book about plants found in Wingbardy far away. I really had no use for it, nor did the family I received it from, but I realised something from it; why that young pony and her family held it so dear. It was the idea of learning that is valuable to all beings. And this is a policy I have tried to build on. While I have had the honor to lead you all, we have made great strides in literacy for our nation. Libraries on wheels travel across the land, distributing books and instruction to all the people. Literacy should be a right that all our citizens are entitled to. So that we may all work towards a better, more educated future for Kása.""
kasa.2.a:0 "More books for everyone!"

kasa.3.t:0 "Xatisa Relief"
kasa.3.d:0 "As the clapping calmed down Mansu Erba's face became a grimace. Luâ could be seen looking down, expecting what was coming next.\n\n"Though this meeting would not be complete without adressing the problem at our northern border. For refugees continue to flee from tyranny from that accursed land. We are a nation of free beings dedicated to the idea that all creatures of the world should be free and possess the rights and freedoms we hold dear. With this, we are called to action to protect these ponies who flee from that wicked place called Barrad."\n\nThis drew reactions of support from the room, especially from councilor Yrmthu, an earth pony who herself was born to refugees.\n\nBut these cheers of support did little to lighten Erba's mood. She raised her hoof, quieting the crowd before continuing. "But in answering this call to action, I have failed. I did not act quick enough or decisive enough. For years now we have been supporting the refugees, and we have made some headway. Many now have jobs in our land and are creating homes and families for themselves. But many more are still struggling. While we may be able to support them, I have failed to find a way to create for them a new home. In this, I ask for your forgiveness."\n\nNow, Yrmthu spoke up; "Avo, no one is perfect. You could not have known what a struggle it would be for the nation to overcome this. My own parents could never have known what this nation would endure when they arrived here. Even I bear some responsibility, I most likely have not done enough either. No one has yet found a perfect solution, do not be so hard on yourself. We all must stand up and take this problem head-on. For the good of all the citizens of Kása.""
kasa.3.a:0 "It is a shared blame, Avo. . ."

kasa.4.t:0 "Prudutu Projektu"
kasa.4.d:0 "Mansu Erba clears her throat and gestures to the lights that hang from the ceiling of the council chamber. Nodding and smiling she begins to speak again.\n\n"Something I am proud that I have been able to do for this nation is moving our economy forward. It has been a team effort from all of us, but I believe I can finally make this declaration; Kása is beginning to enter the modern era step by step, and I for one could not be happier about it.\n\nApplause went up around the room, but were quickly hushed as Mansu gestured her hoof to the back of the chamber\n\n"And for all that I have someone to thank. Pasarinha." All eyes turned to the zebra at the back of the room, dressed in an old naval uniform and possessing a gruff stubble of facial hair, he nodded his head and smiled at the Avo di Kása. Erba groaned, rolled her eyes, and spoke again, "No! Get up here! We all know you love the spotlight and this is a moment well deserved" Pasarinha chuckled and began to move to the front of the room, he took off his hat and bowed before the rest of the Council, earning applause from all including Erba and Luâ.\n\nStarting again, Erba remarked "You have done incredible work for this nation. It is thanks to you the factories of Seguro are running with machinery we only heard tales of not too long ago. Your shipping routes have connected us to the rest of the world, and brought me closer to Kása.", Erba began to chuckle, "Nothing makes me happier than to speak to the citizens on the radio, where all can hear me. It does give me some stage freight, but I love it none the less. So thank you very much Pasarinha."\n\nThe room once again applauded as the former naval captain once again took his seat."
kasa.4.a:0 "Industrial progress is vital for our continue freedom!"

kasa.5.t:0 "Our Harpy  Kin in the South"
kasa.5.d:0 ""Now that local matters are behind us, it is time to move on to our affairs abroad. Tómas Riachuelo, please stand up."\n\nAlong the side of the room, a short, stout Harpy rises from his seat and waves his claw to those assembled.\n\n"I would like to thank you for the work you have done fostering the friendship between our two nations. We could not be more grateful for your assistance in these trying times. Thanks as well to the ever-helpful diplomat Silera Medu, who has been working with the ambassador"\n\nErba gestures to a tall, lanky zebra seated next to Tómas, much in contrast to the Harpy's stout frame.\n\n"You two have done great work in fostering the bond between our two nations." Now speaking to the room, "Macawia was our first ally in the battle against tyranny, and we are happy to still count them on that list. The Pact of 907 still stands firm in our minds, and we are proud of the partnership that has been developed here. We share each other's values, and we fight the same fight. While we struggle against the slavers and despots of this continent, Macawia battles the tyrants of Colthage, and in that struggle, we wish you the best."\n\nWith this the councilors cheer, and Erba walks to shake the Macawian Ambassador's claw. After the brief embrace, she takes her seat once more."
kasa.5.a:0 "To a continued friendship!"

kasa.6.t:0 "Beyond Our Borders"
kasa.6.d:0 ""While we do everything we can to secure the safety of our citizens within our nation. There are those nearby our borders who wish to do us harm."\n\nThe mood in the room becomes grim, councilor Yrmthu is visibly shaken and begins to knock her hoof on the floor, and many other councilors show similar agitation.\n\n"To our east lies Austurland. Whether we can count them among friends or foes seems to be up to their new Jarl, Ygritte. None of us can say for sure what type of person she is, so we must always be wary of her. To the west is Gryphus; as we speak, they hold a congress at Riaportu plotting their nation's next move. While their current regime is not aligned against us, we are not their friends." Erbu's speech becomes rash, "They would gladly wish for our citizens to be subjected to the will of their orders of knights and their ruthless corporations." The room stands in shock as Mansu Erba begins to cough, regaining her breath she raises a hoof to signal she does not needs help, calming herself she continues in a less rabid tone, "Gyphus does not stand for freedom. We can hope one day they may embrace these ideals, but until then, we must be on guard."\n\nPausing for a moment, Erba reads the room, her coughing fit has startled many, but she collects herself and begins again. "To our north lies the "nation" of Barrad. As I have already discussed, the treatment of their people is abominable and has caused many to flee into our nation's arms. I believe our policy should be this, wipe them from the continent one way or another." Councilors around the room nod, having forgotten about the health scare moments earlier, "Even farther north lies Wittenland and the River Coalition. While many of these nations have embraced the same freedom we have here in Kása, they still hold slavers and tyrants in their midst. We must be wary of a silver tongue backed up by iron chains. Our policy should be to not provoke these nations, as I believe we may one day be friends. But if the gaze of Wittenland or Nimbusia ever turns south. We must be prepared to protect ourselves with all our might and spirit.""
kasa.6.a:0 "Times are changing but the struggle continues on."

kasa.7.t:0 "First Commander's Final Statement"
kasa.7.d:0 ""Finally, before we break out and begin the nitty-gritty details out our national politics, I have a few more things to say to you all."\n\nThis comment draws the attention of the room, all present lean forward and wait with bated breath, and out of the corner of her eye, Yrmthu notices that Luâ is surprised as well. Whatever these remarks are, they must be important. The pony meets eyes with Pasarinha, who bares a stern look on his face. Yrmthu tries to stifle a gasp as she realises he has seen the same thing.\n\n"I have lead this nation for forty years. It is a part of me as much I am a part of it. You all call me the Avo behind my back, I know that, and I have learned to accept it. While thus far, I have talked about change, I now want of speak of things to remain the same. This Council has advised me for all my time as the First Commander. While its faces may have changed some, its spirit is always the same. Democratic elections, limits on terms, it must remain a pillar of Kása for as long as this nation draws breath. Our laws have stayed the same in spirit, while we have needed to modernize them to the standards of the day, they must always try to protect those who may not be able to protect themselves, and guard the rights and liberties of all our citizens. This spirit must also remain the same."\n\nMansu Erba paused, taking a deep breath, she begins again, speaking in a more hushed tone, "Though I should not busy you all with too many words. For there is one more thing that needs some change in Kása...""
kasa.7.a:0 "Silence falls into the room. . ."

kasa.8.t:0 "The Sudden Announcement"
kasa.8.d:0 ""Me."\n\nThe single word reverberates around the room multiple times. All in attendance, ask themselves over and over if they had heard it correctly. Luâ stares at Erba, unable to think clearly. She stammers out a sentence, "But Avo we ne-" Erba cuts her short, "I am not to be Kása's Avo any longer. My health is waning, I am growing weaker, both of mind and of body. And we are entering an age of problems that I am just not prepared to face. These are the issues of steel and electricity, of modern politics and diplomacy. I can not lead you all any longer. I will work with the government to organize elections for a new First Commander, and then I shall be off to live the rest of my life. I have a husband to get back to, you know."\n\nThe shock finally sits in amongst all present, all those who were not seated already find somewhere to rest themselves. There are shaking heads and teary eyes all around the chamber, even the Macawian ambassador shows signs of emotion over this. Suddenly, Yrmthu rises and begins to speak, "But Mansu! This is so sudden! What is Kása is not ready for this!"\n\nErbu smiles, "Of course Kása is ready. It has been my life's work to prepare it for a moment that I didn't even know would come. I know as well as all of you here that all First Commanders have lead Kása for life. But I can not go on any longer. Sometimes, I believe I am the tiredest creature in the world." Mansu Erba sits calmly, and a moment of silence winds through the room, all the creatures in attendance realize she is genuine. And as Erba sees this, she goes on\n\n"Please, all of you, know that I have made this decision taking everything I can into account. I was elected in a crisis, and I have lived a crisis since then. I am looking forward to the day where I can wake up in my own home, and live my life as a mother and grandmother without the concerns of a nation weighing on my spirit. Believe me, I value highly the work I have done for this nation, and I am filled with joy to see its success, but I am still a mare, and I have things I would like to do with myself. You all shower me with praise for what I have done, but after today look upon me and see just another citizen of this nation we have worked together to build, another creature basking in the liberty and freedom that Kása grants to all who live within its borders. I know already many of you shall ask me for advice on how to preserve our nation and its traditions, so I shall address that now. As long as your hearts are interwoven with the spirit of freedom, and of liberty, then you have no need for the words of any single zebra, for you can simply listen to your own heart, and it may guide you to tomorrow. I have already given you my thoughts on the state of our nation today, if you wish for the last testament of my political life use that if you wish. But remember, while Kása may be a part of me, it is a part of all of you as well. Do not let any forces cloud that perception in your minds. Kása may be a nation, but it is also a spirit. And that spirit lives within all of us. Thank you."\n\nMansu Erba, A Avo di Kása, rises from her seat. Walking with a vitality she has not possessed in years, she leaves the Council hall and enters the passenger seat of a car. Beside her is her husband, and together they drive off to their country home. All inside are left full of emotion and questions. But a select few are getting ideas...\n\n As the last few minutes have finally settled in Luâ's mind, his head turns to the great window that lets light into the chamber, and he begins to wonder something...\n\nAt the same time, Yrmthu and Pasarinha see Luâ and meet eyes with eachother then they wonder as well...\n\nWhat does the future of Kása hold?"
kasa.8.a:0 "C-can she even do that? Oh Avo... What will happen now?"

Yet what was meant to be a formal, typical election has now turned into something else; for our the First Commander Mansu Erba has retired and, as per law and tradition, a new First Commander shall be chosen by the councillors following the election. This in itself has led to the election turning into one for who should become the next First Commander, as local candidates clash with one another in support of prominent names. So far, four in particular have shown prominence."

mansu_erba_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 7th May 931 in Seguro\n\n§YBiography§!:Born second child to a farmer family, Mansu Erba grew in the vast farmlands just outside the capital Seguro, spending her youth exploring nature. Unlike her peers, she and her siblings received basic education from their parents, learning to read and write. As Mansu’s elder brother would inherit the farm, she had to find life elsewhere and so Mansu left for the capital, to live and work at a shop owned by relatives. However, this life was not to be as she enlisted in 950 in a Macawian military program which she graduated from in 954. As a sub-teniente, her cleverness earned her the attention of the Skapatoria Programa.\n\nFor three years, she worked as an undercover agent in Austurland, Wittenland and Nimbusia, where she helped many escaping to freedom. Mansu proved herself to be a capable operative and in 957, she rose to fame for her actions in Austurland as she lead the escape of over a hundred thralls despite taking a musket ball to her gut. She received a hero’s welcome at Seguro and an award for her self-sacrifice from the First Commander. Sadly, the musket ball that made her a hero also prevented her from ever working as an operative again. At the hospital, the recovering zebra would meet her future husband, a widowed doctor, and the two would be married two years later. In 960 the Advisory Council elections saw Mansu chosen as a councillor of Seguro.\n\nWhile Kása had continued to prosper, in 967 the Barrad Crisis erupted. As streams of refugees trickled into Kása, the First Commander of the time suffered a stroke. As the crisis worsened, an emergency election in the council saw Mansu Erba narrowly elected as the First Commander. She acted swiftly, diverting all funds from industrialisation programs and appealing to Macawia for aid. Kása suffered from it but it endured, their founding ideals upheld as Mansu argued to the critics. After all, is a factory worth betraying oneself?\n\nDespite the hardships in the following decades, Kása chose to trust in its timely hero and under Mansu’s leadership, Kása slowly recovered from the crisis thanks to extensive literacy and economic reform programs. Now, she is known as A avo di Kása —Kása’s Grandmother.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Printik"
