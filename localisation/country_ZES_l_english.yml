Only a small cadre of officers —trained in Macawia's military academies— are considered professional soldiers while a foreign legion funded by Macawia augments the local defence forces. This ad-hoc system is not capable of meeting the demands of modern warfare and recent reforms by Mansu Erba have considelated smaller regional units to formal garrison forces, forming the first permanent ground forces in Kása's history.\n\nEven then, Kása, formally at least, has no official standing army and this limits the government's authority in raising any new forces."

ZES_election_candidates_category_desc:0 "As it has been and shall be, the Kásan Advisory Council has once again ended its tenure and all across the lands, citizens gather to their local towns and villages to choose councillors to represent them in the national forum. Yet what was meant to be a formal, typical election has now turned into something else; for our the First Commander Mansu Erba has retired and, as per law and tradition, a new First Commander shall be chosen by the councillors following the election. This in itself has led to the election turning into one for who should become the next First Commander, as local candidates clash with one another in support of prominent names. So far, four in particular have shown prominence."

mansu_erba_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 7th May 931 in Seguro\n\n§YBiography§!:Born second child to a farmer family, Mansu Erba grew in the vast farmlands just outside the capital Seguro, spending her youth exploring nature. Unlike her peers, she and her siblings received basic education from their parents, learning to read and write. As Mansu’s elder brother would inherit the farm, she had to find life elsewhere and so Mansu left for the capital, to live and work at a shop owned by relatives. However, this life was not to be as she enlisted in 950 in a Macawian military program which she graduated from in 954. As a sub-teniente, her cleverness earned her the attention of the Skapatoria Programa.\n\nFor three years, she worked as an undercover agent in Austurland, Wittenland and Nimbusia, where she helped many escaping to freedom. Mansu proved herself to be a capable operative and in 957, she rose to fame for her actions in Austurland as she lead the escape of over a hundred thralls despite taking a musket ball to her gut. She received a hero’s welcome at Seguro and an award for her self-sacrifice from the First Commander. Sadly, the musket ball that made her a hero also prevented her from ever working as an operative again. At the hospital, the recovering zebra would meet her future husband, a widowed doctor, and the two would be married two years later. In 960 the Advisory Council elections saw Mansu chosen as a councillor of Seguro.\n\nWhile Kása had continued to prosper, in 967 the Barrad Crisis erupted. As streams of refugees trickled into Kása, the First Commander of the time suffered a stroke. As the crisis worsened, an emergency election in the council saw Mansu Erba narrowly elected as the First Commander. She acted swiftly, diverting all funds from industrialisation programs and appealing to Macawia for aid. Kása suffered from it but it endured, their founding ideals upheld as Mansu argued to the critics. After all, is a factory worth betraying oneself?\n\nDespite the hardships in the following decades, Kása chose to trust in its timely hero and under Mansu’s leadership, Kása slowly recovered from the crisis thanks to extensive literacy and economic reform programs. Now, she is known as A avo di Kása —Kása’s Grandmother.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Printik"
