ZES_livru_programa:0 "Livru Programa"

ZES_xatisa_relief:0 "Xatisa Relief"
ZES_xatisa_relief_desc:0 "While we would love it if this meeting could be only sunshine and good feelings, it is time to discuss the dragon in the room. Our nation possesses a serious issue in the form of Barrad refugees. A report on the situation is due from First Commander."

ZES_prudutu_projektu:0 "Prudutu Projektu"
ZES_prudutu_projektu_desc:0 "While many upon this continent would call us backward and primitive, we have made steps forward in the modernization of our nation. The First Commander and Councilor Pasarinha will address the council on this subject."

ZES_friend_macawia:0 "Our Dearest Macawia"
ZES_friend_macawia_desc:0 "The nation of Macawia holds a dear place in the hearts of all in Kása, and our connection to them is the strongest we have with any foreign power. The ambassador to Macawia is due to give his remarks to the Kásan."

ZES_dread_neighbours:0 "Our Dreaded Neighbours"
ZES_dread_neighbours_desc:0 "We are surrounded on all sides by regimes that may wish to see us wiped out. The dangerous Barrad, the unpredictable Austurland, and threatening Gryphus; add onto this that the River Federation sees our lands as a possible threat to their union. The first commander shall speak on this to steady the hearts of the people."

ZES_council_disbands:0 "First Commander's Closing Statement"
ZES_council_disbands_desc:0 "As the council stacks their papers and prepares to return to their election preparations, all of the councilors await the closing remarks of their First Commander. She has led them through much, and they cling to every word.\n\nSo let us see what she has to say."

ZES_expand_literacy_campaign:0 "Expand Literacy Campaign"
ZES_expand_literacy_campaign_desc:0 "Knowledge can free you. Knowledge that resistance was possible led to our predecessors rising up. Knowledge of its existence led to thousands risking everything in the hunt for freedom. Yet the world demands more than these things, and if Kása is to remain the shining beacon of freedom she always were, then her people must be educated."

ZES_soup_kitchens:0 "Warm Soup For the Hungry"
ZES_soup_kitchens_desc:0 "The steady influx of refugees from the north is not just a matter of suffering and pain, but of poor organization too. We offer aid to those who come here, but it is disjointed, disorganized and inefficient. A desperate refugee starving because of poor organization is a betrayal of what Kása is. For all those who come here, yearning to breathe free, we have to do better."

ZES_formalize_book_drives:0 "Formalizar as Doações di Livros"
ZES_formalize_book_drives_desc:0 "The charity of countless Kásans have helped us hugely in the battle against illiteracy, yet charity unsupported by structures and oversight is inefficient and wasteful.

ZES_call_upon_expats_desc:0 ""...and though you all now reside beyond the borders of Kása, where I hope that life treats you well, I nevertheless wish to ask for your help.

ZES_implore_nation:0 "Implore Kása"
ZES_implore_nation_desc:0 "As we did during the Battle of Ebyron, we must rally as a nation to address the Xatisa. The average citizen must be implored to help house the refugees, to open their larders to help feed them and to watch the paths out of Barrad to aid those in need. Only together can we truly address this crisis."

ZES_wagon_schools:0 "Escolas Móveis"
ZES_wagon_schools_desc:0 "So many of our people live beyond the cities and towns, and we do not have teachers or schools enough to cover every last village. Instead of ignoring them, we should formalize a program of mobile schools, which can cover greater areas and let the little ones be taught closer to home."

ZES_ink_and_bread:0 "Tinta e Padrão"
ZES_ink_and_bread_desc:0 "Nourishment is everything for a student to learn well, and proper educational tools is as essential to truly prosper. The apex of Lûa Ramedi's great literacy campaign will set in stone the rights of all Kásans to both these things. There can be no excuses for failure. Our people will be fed and educated, period."

ZES_meet_with_yrmthu:0 "Meet With Yrmthu"
ZES_meet_with_yrmthu_desc:0 "If there is anyone who embodies Kása it is Yrmthu, a once starving refugee who now has risen to become one of Kása's greatest leaders. Her zealous dedication to the people is admirable, and if she would be willing to take a place in our cabinet she would be a great asset."

ZES_meet_with_pasarinha:0 "Meet With Pasarinha"
ZES_meet_with_pasarinha_desc:0 "The modern world waits for no one, and Pasarinha is just the kind of asset we need to make sure Kása can face down the challenges of the modern era. In an age of industry, we must be able to think big, and he can help us with this."

ZES_instill_trust:0 "Instill Trust"
ZES_instill_trust_desc:0 "Lûa Ramedi is many things, but a firebrand speaker is not one of them. His skill has always been more in the administrative and the organizational field, and to instil confidence in the people, he has chosen to simply get to work, decisively moving to address many issues that have piled up in recent years. Bureaucracy and maintenance isn't attractive, but it is necessary."

ZES_intellectual_advisors:0 "Intellectual Advisors"
ZES_intellectual_advisors_desc:0 "Different times call for different skill-sets. Gone is the day where brave fighters or canny smugglers were what Kása needed. Now it needs engineers, scientists and scholars. Thankfully, Lûa Ramedi has taken careful notes during his many years of service, and he knows just the kind of creatures to call upon."

ZES_economic_advisors:0 "Economic Advisors"
ZES_economic_advisors_desc:0 "A strong Kása must have a strong economy. A strong economy will give the people jobs, it will allow us to field a stronger army and it will allow us to master our own fates. This will not happen on its own though, and we must make sure to listen carefully to those who know how to navigate these particular waters."

ZES_shared_responsibility:0 "Equilíbrio di Poder"
ZES_shared_responsibility_desc:0 "As Kása advances, new powers emerge within her, powers that could change her for the worse.

ZES_continue_projektu:0 "Continue Projektu"
ZES_continue_projektu_desc:0 "The Prudutu Projektu is one of Mansu Erba's great accomplishments, and though it is tempting to expand and accelerate it, the steady progress that has been made is not to be scoffed at. To gamble with the progress made would be irresponsible, and it is better to make good use of the progress being made."

ZES_implore_affluent:0 "Appeal To the Affluents"
ZES_implore_affluent_desc:0 "There are many in Kása who have managed to build a great life for themselves, and though we would not dream to begrudge them their success, it is hard to avoid the fact that when you have a lot, you would rather keep it. Convincing the wealthy to help out is different from convincing the poor, yet it can still be done."

ZES_bridges_and_roads:0 "Pontes Sobre Ilhas"
ZES_bridges_and_roads_desc:0 "A bridge is a strong symbol for unity and progress both. It lets even the poorest cross on the same terms as the richest, it allows for the flow of commerce and industry and it opens up formerly isolated regions to the rest of the nation."

ZES_invest_local_civilian:0 "Support Local Companies"
ZES_invest_local_civilian_desc:0 "Kása shall stand on its own four hooves, that has never been up for debate. Those zebras and ponies who toil away in their workshops and stores could become so much more, if we only make sure to give them a helping hoof."

ZES_hire_refugees:0 "Employment Opportunities Act"
ZES_hire_refugees_desc:0 "Our people need jobs, but one cannot simply jump into a job cannon to be fired off into job land where jobs grow on jobbies. A more sober view of the situation acknowledges that some need only to be put in contact with prospective employers, but some need training, some need guidance, and all need actual opportunities."

ZES_open_our_ports:0 "Abri Nossas Portus"
ZES_open_our_ports_desc:0 "Kása is not an island unto herself, and her limited resources mean that she needs to embrace the world in order to prosper. We have the location for it, and if we make sure to embrace our naval heritage, we can build ourselves into a naval power both economically and militarily."

ZES_projektu_tera:0 "Projektu Tera"
ZES_projektu_tera_desc:0 "Much of Kasa is still untamed wilderness and underdeveloped countryside where little has been accomplished. This, too, shall change though. With the Kásan economy invigorated, we have the resources and the expertise to begin the first ever development project not of Seguro, or Ilhas Rosca, but of all Kása."

ZES_deal_with_jarl:0 "Lidar Com Austurland"
ZES_deal_with_jarl_desc:0 "The deer to the east have been a concern for Kása for as long as we can remember. At times there has been peace, yet at times their raiders have savaged our lands. Until now we have not been in a position to deal with the matter for good, yet between our rapid growth in recent years as well as the changes in Austurland, the time has finally come to address the issue on a more permanent basis."

ZES_free_minds_and_hearts:0 "Free Minds and Hearts"
ZES_free_minds_and_hearts_desc:0 "One of the key freedoms of all creatures is the freedom of opportunity, and in order to have the most opportunities in the modern world, knowledge is essential. We must learn, we must understand, and we must grow. This is the duty of all free creatures, and we shall not waver."

ZES_monument:0 "Monument of the Downtrodden"
ZES_monument_desc:0 "Kása has many reasons to be proud of its accomplishments, and its defenders should be honored. Yet, it would be easy to throw up a tacky statue to honor and service and courage. Too easy, in fact. War is not like that, and it would be wrong to whitewash it."

ZES_remember_past:0 "Remember the Past..."
ZES_remember_past_desc:0 "Our nation was founded by desperate refugees on an alien shore, who transformed their situation from desperation to prosperity. We owe all to those who came before us, and we will always remember them."

ZES_for_future:0 "...For the Sake of the Future"
ZES_for_future_desc:0 "One day, our descendants will look back on what we accomplished, and their judgement will fall on us, as it falls on everycreature.

ZES_educate_all:0 "Edukason Universal"
ZES_educate_all_desc:0 "If our nation shall advance, we must make sure even the least among us are given the skills and the education needed for the modern world. No matter where they live, no matter their background, and no matter their character, we must give them all proper education."

ZES_teach_democracy:0 "Democratic Values"
ZES_teach_democracy_desc:0 "Though Kása's doors stand open for all, this should not be confused for blind tolerance for every idea out there. It might be paradoxical, but in order for democracy to prosper, it must justify and educate the people about its existence and its demands, otherwise we give tyrants an open gate to use democracy to abolish it."

ZES_mandatory_and_free:0 "Supplementary Schools"
ZES_mandatory_and_free_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, there are those who do not fit into the education system. Thankfully, Yrmthu has proposed a solution for how to address this. Instead of beating them down and leaving them feeling worthless, we will create a system of supplementary schools with looser reins, where those who failed once can get a new chance on their own terms."

ZES_students_abroad:0 "Student Exchange Program"
ZES_students_abroad_desc:0 "As our education system grows, it is attracting more attention from abroad. Ambitious scientists and professors across Kása has already forged bonds with academies beyond our shores, and there are many who would accept our sons and daughters as students."

ZES_formal_education:0 "Enshrine Formal Education"
ZES_formal_education_desc:0 "Knowledge is power, and we are steadily working towards making Kása a scientific great power. In due time, Seguro can become an academic institution much like Yale, but in order for this to happen, we must be ready to dedicate ourselves to this pursuit."

ZES_build_faculty:0 "Build Modern Faculties"
ZES_build_faculty_desc:0 "Scientific progress is no longer a matter of singular geniuses, but an industrial effort that requires specialized tools, and we're not going to let our finest minds struggle without proper equipment."

ZES_latest_curriculum:0 "Currículo Mais Risentimenti"
ZES_latest_curriculum_desc:0 "Once, certain crafts were vital for Kása, but time has marched on and we must reevaluate what our students are taught. In the classrom, the children are prepared for modern society, and things like wickercrafting is not nearly as useful as it once was."

ZES_unified_spirit:0 "Espírito Unificado"
ZES_unified_spirit_desc:0 "From pre-schools to the highest universities, our education system is one entity. It is the first gentle hoof that molds our citizens to be able to thrive, and no matter where they are, there is a way forward for them."

ZES_practical_education:0 "Assess Practical Education"
ZES_practical_education_desc:0 "It is true that academic education is vital, but so is the more hooves-on type of knowledge. We shouldn't forget the value of the practical alongside the theoretical. A master engineer holds value equal to a genius professor, and the education should be held in equal regard. "

ZES_apprenticeship_program:0 "Apprenticeship Program"
ZES_apprenticeship_program_desc:0 "Most crafts are not learned in the school bench, but in the workshop and on the factory floor. For all those practically minded foals and chicks who languish in the classroom, there should be an easy and establsihed way to let them come into their own right."

ZES_cooperate_with_business:0 "Kordena Com Nogosi"
ZES_cooperate_with_business_desc:0 "The private sector of Kása holds countless talented innovators and businesscreatures, and their experiences can help shaping our apprentices. This, in turn, will let the private sector benefit all of Kása more indirectly as well."

ZES_entrepreneurial_spirit:0 "Espírito Empreendedor"

ZES_shining_pearl:0 "The Shining Pearl"
ZES_shining_pearl_desc:0 "On the shores of southern Griffonia, Kása stands as a beacon of hope and prosperity for all, a place where none is left without a chance to fulfil their full potential. Since the days of Akeeku, we have known that prosperity is measured as how the weakest among us are doing, and in this regard, we have delivered!"

ZES_freedom_of_press:0 "Cherish the Free Press"
ZES_freedom_of_press_desc:0 "We will never allow ourselves to become so high and mighty that we cannot tolerate criticism. If the free media wishes to protest against the actions we take, that is their perogative. Ours will be to listen."

ZES_discredit_tyranny:0 "Discredit Tyrannical Ideals"
ZES_discredit_tyranny_desc:0 "Democracy is not - must not - be two wolves and a sheep voting on who is for dinner, nor should it meekly accept challenges to its core values. Those who seek to undermine our democracy will be challenged to prove their reasoning, and through the virtue of Kása's achievments they will be found wanting."

ZES_codify_institutions:0 "Codifying our Institutions"
ZES_codify_institutions_desc:0 "Having tasted the power available to the First Commander, Lûa Ramedi finds himself hesitating. The power at his command is immense, and it will only grow. Though he would not presume to judge those who served before him, he simply cannot let virtue alone be what restrains him. Laws help society hold itself to a higher standard, and he should not be exempt."

ZES_mansuism:0 "Mansuism"
ZES_mansuism_desc:0 "Kása's Advisory Council is a fine institution, one that supposedly has the power to depose even the First Commander. It is time to do away with the gray areas and let it take up the burden of leadership. Lûa Ramedi is content to sit in it as first among equals, and the immense powers he hold can go back where it belongs: to the people."

ZES_welfare_to_poor:0 "Establish Welfare System"
ZES_welfare_to_poor_desc:0 "Kásans have always taken care of each other, and our government should be no different.

ZES_open_doors:0 "Into Kása's embrace"
ZES_open_doors_desc:0 "Ho there wanderer, from distant shores/Whose journey brings you to our gate/We beg you, sit, we'll tend your sores/If you would tell us of your fate\nThe path behind you grows dark still/From whence you were forced to roam/But you can rest now, if you will/Come, let Kása be your new home."

ZES_bakaran_way:0 "The Bakaran Way"
ZES_bakaran_way_desc:0 "To our north, Bakara has a longstanding tradition of local democracy, and while recent events there have given reason to be mindful of the kinks in the system, the value of keeping democracy close to the constituents cannot be overstated."

ZES_define_democratic_process:0 "The Due Process of the Law"
ZES_define_democratic_process_desc:0 "Democratic Kása is a frail idea, and it needs to be firmly established by law and by culture both.

ZES_skapatoria_purpose:0 "Agents of Freedom"
ZES_skapatoria_purpose_desc:0 "The Skapatoria Programa is one of Kása's greatest assets, and its services will not be less vital in the future.

ZES_embassies:0 "Our Place in the World"
ZES_embassies_desc:0 "Kása is a small nation in a big world, and our best bet for survival is to rely on more than our army and our people, but on our friends as well. We are not alone in our desire for peace and harmony, and we should endeavour to find like-minded regimes out there."

ZES_republican_thought:0 "Philosophy of the Tricolour"
ZES_republican_thought_desc:0 "The issues facing Kása is not unique, and other species have found their own answers. The ideals of Alexander Kemerskai and the Griffonian republicans offer a solution to Lûa Ramedi's woes. Kása's First Commander and the Griffonian President are, in the end, similar insitutions, and the First Commander should be bound like the president is meant to be."

ZES_protect_liberty:0 "In Defence of Liberty"
ZES_protect_liberty_desc:0 "Kása's army is not an instrument of suppression, but a tool of liberty. They fight to defend their fellow creatures, no matter what challenges arise, and internal threats are no different. If, the gods forbid, the institutions of law and order fail, the military has a sacred duty. If need be, they must step in to defend not power-hungry politicians, but the values of the nation."

ZES_prosperous_democracy:0 "Equal Prosperity"
ZES_prosperous_democracy_desc:0 "When a society is divided it becomes weakened. Wwith the wealth that now is at Kása's disposal, it will behoove us to make sure that everyone can benefit from it. Whether born in a hovel or in a palace, all creatures should share what Kása has."

ZES_asterion_model:0 "Asterion Model"
ZES_asterion_model_desc:0 "Freedom isn't free, and the price can too often be paid in blood. Thus it was paid on the D'Vash, and thus it was paid by the Minotaurs of Asterion. We can learn from them, and make sure that we have the tools to safeguard our democracy by whatever means necessary."

ZES_council_republic:0 "Devolved Rule"
ZES_council_republic_desc:0 "The change has been monumental, but it was necessary. Lûa Ramedi held absolute power and his hooves, and he has let it go, giving it to the people who he holds responsibility for. They will be given the highest responsibility and become masters of their own fate."

ZES_presidential_republic:0 "Presidential Executive"
ZES_presidential_republic_desc:0 "The role of the president is to act as a leader in times or war and peace both, yet he holds this power in trust, and he rules as a symbol of unity and mutual respect.

ZES_declare_republic:0 "Declarar a República"
ZES_declare_republic_desc:0 "Kása will never be the same again, and time will pass its judgement as it does with all things, yet Lûa Ramedi knows that this was the right thing to do. Kása's people deserve a voice, and Kása will be stronger for it. "

ZES_macawian_cooperation:0 "Old Friendship"
ZES_macawian_cooperation_desc:0 "Macawia is and will always remain Kása's dear friend. This bond shall not be broken easily, and as a show of good faith, Lûa Ramedi has negoitated for a grand military exercise, under which Macawia will act as the enemy, attempting to invade Kása. It is merely an exercise, but nevertheless Kása has grown enough that it can now stand firm even against its old patron."

ZES_liberation_ships:0 "Navios di Libertação"
ZES_liberation_ships_desc:0 "The seas are our domain as much as the land, and we shall contest it just as fiercely. The seas were where we gained our freedom, and if slavers, raiders or conquerors dare to approach our shores, they shall find the Kásan navy waiting for them. "

ZES_secured_foreign_policy:0 "Watch Out For Foes"
ZES_secured_foreign_policy_desc:0 "Tolerance is not naiveté, nor is a deisre for peace mere weakness. Kása was born throught fighting, and if need be she will do it again. She can defend herself, she wants to defend herself and she will defend herself." 

ZES_secure_borders:0 "Fronteiras Seguras"
ZES_secure_borders_desc:0 "From the very second that an invader sets hoof on our lands, he shall run headlong into our defenses, and not a single inch of Kása shall be surrendered to him without bitter fighting. We are not a superpower, but we can make the enemy spill enough blood that if we finally, the cost was not worth the prize."

ZES_defend_harmony:0 "For the Republic!"
ZES_defend_harmony_desc:0 "If war should come, it is every citizen's duty to defend the nation with every mean available. Every message saying that resistance should cease is a false one, and the only way that peace can be achieved is when the invaders are driven out."

ZES_foundations_of_modern_kasa:0 "Foundations of Modern Kása"
ZES_foundations_of_modern_kasa_desc:0 "From shacks huddling together on a stormy shore, to fledgling towns and villages, to a prosperous nation. Kása is rising, and the fruits of all our labours are growing each day. Yet as we harvest, the question is how we make the most of our blessings."

ZES_public_radio:0 "Radio Kása"
ZES_public_radio_desc:0 "Inspired by the recent development in telecommunications, Radio Kása can finally begin broadcasting.

ZES_continue_public_projects_desc:0 "We have made splendid progress in these last years, and the Xatisa crisis is slowly approaching its end.

ZES_guarantee_employment:0 "Guarantee Employment"
ZES_guarantee_employment_desc:0 "Our successes are leading to new questions, not the least the one regarding what to make of the refugees long term. Adapting to a new society is tricky, and we will have to make sure that they - as well as those who already were here - have a genuine chance as long as they genuinely wish to work. It will cost, but our society will be stronger for it."

ZES_ministry_of_finance:0 "Ministério das Finanças"
ZES_ministry_of_finance_desc:0 "Macawia's financial aid has been invaluable, but the time has come for Kása to stand on its own four hooves. With greater control of our economy, we will be able to more effectively control our own fate."

ZES_international_port:0 "Expandir Portu di Ilha Rosca"
ZES_international_port_desc:0 "The success of the Ilha Rosca ports speaks for itself, but all projections suggest that they are are over capacity. It is overall a pretty nice problem to have, or at least one that can be addressed with some effort."

ZES_fund_development:0 "Renewing Seguro"
ZES_fund_development_desc:0 "Seguro is one of the older cities in Kása, and time has caught up with it. With the recent progress made elsewhere, the time has come to truly regenerate the city.

ZES_invite_the_world:0 "Invite the World To Us"
ZES_invite_the_world_desc:0 "Kása is not and should not be an isolationist state. The world is out there, and instead of casting it out, viewing it as morally inferior, we should embrace it. We will have to prevent certain excesses, true, but if they can behave, they can make us both prosper."

ZES_develope_outback:0 "All of Kása Should Live"
ZES_develope_outback_desc:0 "The cities of Kása will most likely prosper on their own, and that is not where our efforts should be spent. The nature of our economic system means some regions get left behind. We mustn't let that happen, and therefore we must actively work to make sure all of Kása can prosper." 

ZES_gift_land_act:0 "Ato di Propriedadi"
ZES_gift_land_act_desc:0 "Land ownership in Kása is highly unequal, with large swathes of land having been purchased by ambitious land speculators, who many times don't even use the land but seek to sell it at a premium. This state of affairs cannot be allowed to remain, and while we will set a generous lower limit, it is time to break this cycle and make sure that unused land can be claimed by those who would actually make use of it."

ZES_modern_roads:0 "Fyrport-Seguro Railway"
ZES_modern_roads_desc:0 "There is an opportunity to kill two slavers with one stone, the countryside unemployment is maybe not as visible as in the city, but it is still there. Offering these now available workers employment building a railroad from one end of Kása to the other will not only put money into the economy, but if done right it will teach them skills for the future. We also get a really nice railway out of it too!"

ZES_model_villages:0 ""
ZES_model_villages_desc:0 "We should do away with the notion that certain region of Kása are 'frontier regions'. In the distinction lies a devaluation: after all the opposite of frontier is heartland. Not a single square meter of Kása is less important than the heartland. Kása is one, and all of Kása shall prosper together!"

ZES_focus_on_interior:0 "Our Urban Centers"
ZES_focus_on_interior_desc:0 "Kása's cities are the economic engine that drives the nationm, and responsible economic policy dictates that we must spend our money in the most efficient way.

ZES_electrify_land:0 "Utility Poles and Power Plants"
ZES_electrify_land_desc:0 "A Gryphussian advisor recently suggested that as Kása's electrical grid expands, the state should make sure that it was highly controlled through the use of both patents and legislation so that our grip on the power supply was absolute. He was subsequently laughed out of the meeting before an open, modular system that will allow us to easily switch out and access every bit of it was adopted."

ZES_free_apartments:0 "Futurus Aparmentus"
ZES_free_apartments_desc:0 "Electricity, running water, indoor plumbing, these are all things that modern apartments are expected to have, but are they? We should aim to introduce these modern comforts to every last apartment in Kása, no matter where they are."

ZES_model_cities:0 "Cidades Modelo Brilhante"
ZES_model_cities_desc:0 "These once small outposts, founded by exhausted refugees and nearly broken slaves, have grown to be shining beacons of civilization. Not a civilization built on exploitation and tyranny either, but radiant jewels of freedom and prosperity."

ZES_damn_fireshore:0 "Inaugurate the Akeeku Dam"

ZES_plan_regions:0 "Merging the Counties"

### Pre-Election Events ###
kasa.1.t:0 "The Last Convention"
kasa.1.d:0 "As the delegates of the Advisory Council began to gather for the great meeting, there was a buzz of excitement throughout the air. All members of the council eagerly awaited Mansu Erba's 1007 yearly address, as she always had wise words on where their nation should be headed. Every one of them there knew that many problems still faced Kása, obstacles that none of the nation's founders could have foreseen so many years ago. But despite all these Kása remained strong, 50 years on from its greatest challenge to date, the nation held firm under its Avo, it's Grandmother Mansu Erba.\n\nWhen the doors to the chamber opened all creatures in the room turned their heads. There stood Erba with her aid Lûa Ramedi, and as they entered, all rose. Erba shook many hooves as she made her way to the seat at the head of the circle of seats that formed the council. Being helped into her seat by Lûa, who then took his seat in the back of the room as he was not technically a member of the council. As this happened, all the other councilors took their seats and began to look endearingly upon their Avo.\n\nMansu Erba cleared her throat and said, "I do here declare, that the 1007 Advisory Council of Kása is opened.""
kasa.1.a:0 "Hear hear!"

kasa.2.t:0 "Livru Programa"
kasa.2.d:0 "As the hall again fell to silence awaiting Erba's next remarks, she drew from her sachel a book.\n\n"I have carried this with me since my operation in Austurland in 957. It was given to me by a young pony who I, unfortunately, have not been able to track down in the years since. She had almost nothing to her name except this book and chose to give it to me as thanks. That meant it had to have some value to her. So when I first read it, I was surprised to find it was merely a book about plants found in Wingbardy far away. I really had no use for it, nor did the family I received it from, but I realised something from it; why that young pony and her family held it so dear. It was the idea of learning that is valuable to all beings. And this is a policy I have tried to build on. While I have had the honor to lead you all, we have made great strides in literacy for our nation. Libraries on wheels travel across the land, distributing books and instruction to all the people. Literacy should be a right that all our citizens are entitled to. So that we may all work towards a better, more educated future for Kása.""
kasa.2.a:0 "More books for everyone!"

kasa.3.t:0 "Xatisa Relief"
kasa.3.d:0 "As the clapping calmed down Mansu Erba's face became a grimace. Lûa could be seen looking down, expecting what was coming next.\n\n"Though this meeting would not be complete without addressing the problem at our northern border. For refugees continue to flee from tyranny from that accursed land. We are a nation of free beings dedicated to the idea that all creatures of the world should be free and possess the rights and freedoms we hold dear. With this, we are called to action to protect these ponies who flee from that wicked place called Barrad."\n\nThis drew reactions of support from the room, especially from councilor Yrmthu, an earth pony who herself was born to refugees.\n\nBut these cheers of support did little to lighten Erba's mood. She raised her hoof, quieting the crowd before continuing. "But in answering this call to action, I have failed. I did not act quick enough or decisive enough. For years now we have been supporting the refugees, and we have made some headway. Many now have jobs in our land and are creating homes and families for themselves. But many more are still struggling. While we may be able to support them, I have failed to find a way to create for them a new home. In this, I ask for your forgiveness."\n\nNow, Yrmthu spoke up; "Avo, no one is perfect. You could not have known what a struggle it would be for the nation to overcome this. My own parents could never have known what this nation would endure when they arrived here. Even I bear some responsibility, I most likely have not done enough either. No one has yet found a perfect solution, do not be so hard on yourself. We all must stand up and take this problem head-on. For the good of all the citizens of Kása.""
kasa.3.a:0 "It is a shared blame, Avo. . ."

kasa.4.t:0 "Prudutu Projektu"
kasa.4.d:0 "Mansu Erba clears her throat and gestures to the lights that hang from the ceiling of the council chamber. Nodding and smiling she begins to speak again.\n\n"Something I am proud that I have been able to do for this nation is moving our economy forward. It has been a team effort from all of us, but I believe I can finally make this declaration; Kása is beginning to enter the modern era step by step, and I for one could not be happier about it.\n\nApplause went up around the room, but were quickly hushed as Mansu gestured her hoof to the back of the chamber\n\n"And for all that I have someone to thank. Pasarinha." All eyes turned to the zebra at the back of the room, dressed in an old naval uniform and possessing a gruff stubble of facial hair, he nodded his head and smiled at the Avo di Kása. Erba groaned, rolled her eyes, and spoke again, "No! Get up here! We all know you love the spotlight and this is a moment well deserved" Pasarinha chuckled and began to move to the front of the room, he took off his hat and bowed before the rest of the Council, earning applause from all including Erba and Lûa.\n\nStarting again, Erba remarked "You have done incredible work for this nation. It is thanks to you the factories of Seguro are running with machinery we only heard tales of not too long ago. Your shipping routes have connected us to the rest of the world, and brought me closer to Kása.", Erba began to chuckle, "Nothing makes me happier than to speak to the citizens on the radio, where all can hear me. It does give me some stage fright, but I love it none the less. So thank you very much Pasarinha."\n\nThe room once again applauded as the former naval captain once again took his seat."
kasa.4.a:0 "Industrial progress is vital for our continued freedom!"

kasa.5.t:0 "Our Harpy Kin in the South"
kasa.5.d:0 ""Now that local matters are behind us, it is time to move on to our affairs abroad. Tómas Riachuelo, please stand up."\n\nAlong the side of the room, a short, stout Harpy rises from his seat and waves his claw to those assembled.\n\n"I would like to thank you for the work you have done fostering the friendship between our two nations. We could not be more grateful for your assistance in these trying times. Thanks as well to the ever-helpful diplomat Silera Medu, who has been working with the ambassador"\n\nErba gestures to a tall, lanky zebra seated next to Tómas, much in contrast to the Harpy's stout frame.\n\n"You two have done great work in fostering the bond between our two nations." Now speaking to the room, "Macawia was our first ally in the battle against tyranny, and we are happy to still count them on that list. The Pact of 907 still stands firm in our minds, and we are proud of the partnership that has been developed here. We share each other's values, and we fight the same fight. While we struggle against the slavers and despots of this continent, Macawia battles the tyrants of Colthage, and in that struggle, we wish you the best."\n\nWith this the councilors cheer, and Erba walks to shake the Macawian Ambassador's claw. After the brief embrace, she takes her seat once more."
kasa.5.a:0 "To a continued friendship!"

kasa.6.t:0 "Beyond Our Borders"
kasa.6.d:0 ""While we do everything we can to secure the safety of our citizens within our nation. There are those nearby our borders who wish to do us harm."\n\nThe mood in the room becomes grim, councilor Yrmthu is visibly shaken and begins to knock her hoof on the floor, and many other councilors show similar agitation.\n\n"To our east lies Austurland. Whether we can count them among friends or foes seems to be up to their new Jarl, Ygritte. None of us can say for sure what type of person she is, so we must always be wary of her. To the west is Gryphus; as we speak, they hold a congress at Riaportu plotting their nation's next move. While their current regime is not aligned against us, we are not their friends." Erbu's speech becomes rash, "They would gladly wish for our citizens to be subjected to the will of their orders of knights and their ruthless corporations." The room stands in shock as Mansu Erba begins to cough, regaining her breath she raises a hoof to signal she does not needs help, calming herself she continues in a less rabid tone, "Gryphus does not stand for freedom. We can hope one day they may embrace these ideals, but until then, we must be on guard."\n\nPausing for a moment, Erba reads the room, her coughing fit has startled many, but she collects herself and begins again. "To our north lies the "nation" of Barrad. As I have already discussed, the treatment of their people is abominable and has caused many to flee into our nation's arms. I believe our policy should be this, wipe them from the continent one way or another." Councilors around the room nod, having forgotten about the health scare moments earlier, "Even farther north lies Wittenland and the River Coalition. While many of these nations have embraced the same freedom we have here in Kása, they still hold slavers and tyrants in their midst. We must be wary of a silver tongue backed up by iron chains. Our policy should be to not provoke these nations, as I believe we may one day be friends. But if the gaze of Wittenland or Nimbusia ever turns south. We must be prepared to protect ourselves with all our might and spirit.""
kasa.6.a:0 "Times are changing but the struggle continues on."

kasa.7.t:0 "First Commander's Final Statement"
kasa.7.d:0 ""Finally, before we break out and begin the nitty-gritty details out our national politics, I have a few more things to say to you all."\n\nThis comment draws the attention of the room, all present lean forward and wait with bated breath, and out of the corner of her eye, Yrmthu notices that Lûa is surprised as well. Whatever these remarks are, they must be important. The pony meets eyes with Pasarinha, who bares a stern look on his face. Yrmthu tries to stifle a gasp as she realises he has seen the same thing.\n\n"I have led this nation for forty years. It is a part of me as much I am a part of it. You all call me the Avo behind my back, I know that, and I have learned to accept it. While thus far, I have talked about change, I now want of speak of things to remain the same. This Council has advised me for all my time as the First Commander. While its faces may have changed, its spirit is always the same. Democratic elections, limits on terms, it must remain a pillar of Kása for as long as this nation draws breath. Our laws have stayed the same in spirit, while we have needed to modernize them to the standards of the day, they must always try to protect those who may not be able to protect themselves, and guard the rights and liberties of all our citizens. This spirit must also remain the same."\n\nMansu Erba paused, taking a deep breath, she begins again, speaking in a more hushed tone, "Though I should not busy you all with too many words. For there is one more thing that needs some change in Kása...""
kasa.7.a:0 "Silence falls into the room. . ."

kasa.8.t:0 "The Sudden Announcement"
kasa.8.d:0 ""Me."\n\nThe single word reverberates around the room multiple times. All in attendance, ask themselves over and over if they had heard it correctly. Lûa stares at Erba, unable to think clearly. He stammers out a sentence, "But Avo we ne-" Erba cuts him short, "I am not to be Kása's Avo any longer. My health is waning, I am growing weaker, both of mind and of body. And we are entering an age of problems that I am just not prepared to face. These are the issues of steel and electricity, of modern politics and diplomacy. I can not lead you all any longer. I will work with the government to organize elections for a new First Commander, and then I shall be off to live the rest of my life. I have a husband to get back to, you know."\n\nThe shock finally sits in amongst all present, all those who were not seated already find somewhere to rest themselves. There are shaking heads and teary eyes all around the chamber, even the Macawian ambassador shows signs of emotion over this. Suddenly, Yrmthu rises and begins to speak, "But Mansu! This is so sudden! What if Kása is not ready for this!" Erbu smiles, "Of course Kása is ready. It has been my life's work to prepare it for a moment that I didn't even know would come. I know as well as all of you here that all First Commanders have led Kása for life. But I can not go on any longer. Sometimes, I believe I am the tiredest creature in the world." Mansu Erba sits calmly, and a moment of silence winds through the room, all the creatures in attendance realize she is genuine. And as Erba sees this, she goes on\n\n"Please, all of you, know that I have made this decision taking everything I can into account. I was elected in a crisis, and I have lived a crisis since then. I am looking forward to the day where I can wake up in my own home, and live my life as a mother and grandmother without the concerns of a nation weighing on my spirit. Believe me, I value highly the work I have done for this nation, and I am filled with joy to see its success, but I am still a mare, and I have things I would like to do with myself. You all shower me with praise for what I have done, but after today look upon me and see just another citizen of this nation we have worked together to build, another creature basking in the liberty and freedom that Kása grants to all who live within its borders. I know already many of you shall ask me for advice on how to preserve our nation and its traditions, so I shall address that now. As long as your hearts are interwoven with the spirit of freedom, and of liberty, then you have no need for the words of any single zebra, for you can simply listen to your own heart, and it may guide you to tomorrow. I have already given you my thoughts on the state of our nation today, if you wish for the last testament of my political life use that if you wish. But remember, while Kása may be a part of me, it is a part of all of you as well. Do not let any forces cloud that perception in your minds. Kása may be a nation, but it is also a spirit. And that spirit lives within all of us. Thank you."\n\nMansu Erba, A Avo di Kása, rises from her seat. Walking with a vitality she has not possessed in years, she leaves the Council hall and enters the passenger seat of a car. Beside her is her husband, and together they drive off to their country home."
kasa.8.a:0 "C-can she even do that? Oh Avo... What will happen now?"

## Election events ##

kasa.9.t:0 "The Sinu Scandal"
kasa.9.d:0 "One of the very first electoral debates took place in the old square of Ilha Roca where more than a century ago, Kása saw the birth of its democracy. Many had expected it to be rather calm while the locals were still in the shock of Mansu Erba’s demission but in the end, the debate quickly got heated. The Ilha Rocans had been enraged for days after the press broke the news of a corruption case in Seguro. A councilmare named Sinu was facing charges over an alleged corruption from a Macawian private company seeking to build a branch office in the Kásan capital. However, the case was made complex by Sinu’s decision to turn herself in for accepting a large sum of money and gifts from the company, arguing that she had misinterpreted the company’s intent. The company in turn tried to claim the whole affair had been one large misunderstanding caused by an internal mistake and translation errors. Sinu being a relatively popular politician and the specifics of the case made the matter hugely controversial in Ilha Roca where corruption is heavily looked down upon.\n\nUpon being asked about the matter, each of the candidate tried and take position. Lûa Ramedi argued that the law was clear and all ought to face charges though lenient ones in the case of Sinu considering she turned herself in. Yrmthu pounced on the argument, arguing that leniency would send the wrong message to the private sector and to the civil servants. She would rather see harsh sentences being given though clearly harsher upon the company who had no excuse for attempting bribery. Áltu Kexa in turn agreed with Yrmthu over the evident foul play at the company’s hooves but argued that Sinu acted in good faith and had no responsibility. Worse, she considered that it would be criminal to remove a virtuous public servant for a private company’s wrongdoing. Pasarinha finally intervened, arguing that there was little point in tearing each other apart over a so-called bribery case being reported by the alleged bribed. Instead, he argued it would serve as a teachable moment for everyone in Kása and both Sinu and the company ought to be relaxed since no clear harm had been done."
kasa.9.a:0 "Lûa Ramedi convinced the crowd."
kasa.9.b:0 "Pasarinha prevailed in the exchange."
kasa.9.c:0 "Yrmthu made the most convincing case." 
kasa.9.e:0 "Áltu Kexa was right."

kasa.43.t:0 "The Fate of Councilmare Sinu"
kasa.43.d:0 "Today the Seguro Court of Justice announced their ruling in the bribery case known as the Sinu Scandal. The trial was relatively short all things considered as councilmare Sinu was fully cooperating with the prosecution, hoping to clear her name.\n\nIn the end, her cooperation did not matter much as she was found guilty of corruption and sentenced to one year of prison and a fine. She would also be banned from eligibility for the next ten years. The company involved was fined for a significant sum.\n\nIn his speech, the judge lauded the Kásan public for remaining dignify and trustful of their institutions despite the politicisation of the case that had occurred during the electoral campaign. He advised all in Kása to remain committed to the ethics of any and all public offices and that harmony may only be maintained through public trust in the ethical behaviour of everyone. Despite this, the decision was booed by a few protestors who supported councilmare Sinu."
kasa.43.a:0 "A just ruling."

kasa.44.t:0 "The Fate of Councilmare Sinu"
kasa.44.d:0 "Today the Seguro Court of Justice announced their ruling in the bribery case known as the Sinu Scandal. The trial was relatively short all things considered as councilmare Sinu was fully cooperating with the prosecution, hoping to clear her name. Though no protests disrupted the trial itself, many opinion piece in the press dismissed the trial as a waste of time and money as the councilmare had given back the money.\n\nIn the end, her cooperation proved to have been her saving grace as she was found guilty of attempted corruption but only sentenced to a fine and suspended one year of prison. The company involved was fined for a moderate sum.\n\nIn his speech, the judge scolded Sinu for letting herself be so naive as to accept gifts from professional contacts in the first place to which Sinu solemnly promise to never again engage in such behaviour and apologized for disappointing her constituents. The judge also addressed the public, warning against a lax attitude towards the matter of corruption in Kása. He reminded all that naivety is the first step towards the decay of harmony. At her exit from the tribunal, councilmare Sinu was welcomed by a small cheering crowd of her supporters."
kasa.44.a:0 "A just ruling."

kasa.45.t:0 "The Fate of Councilmare Sinu"
kasa.45.d:0 "Today the Seguro Court of Justice announced their ruling in the bribery case known as the Sinu Scandal. The trial was relatively short all things considered as councilmare Sinu was fully cooperating with the prosecution, hoping to clear her name.\n\nIn the end, her cooperation did not matter as she was found guilty of corruption and sentenced to two year of prison and a fine. She would also be banned from eligibility for the next fifteen years. The company involved was fined for a significant sum.\n\nIn his speech, the judge lauded the Kásan public for remaining dignify and trustful of their institutions despite the politicisation of the case that had occurred during the electoral campaign. He scolded councilmare Sinu for her action but did lauded her decision to come clean in the end. He advised the public to be mindful that everyone can make mistakes and that it matters more that public harmony is restored in the end than how hard the stick strikes the punished. The decision was booed by a few protestors who supported councilmare Sinu but applauded by a few protestors who had come to shame her."

kasa.43.t:0 "The Fate of Councilmare Sinu"
kasa.43.d:0 "Today the Seguro Court of Justice announced their ruling in the bribery case known as the Sinu Scandal. The trial was relatively short despite the change in attitude of councilmare Sinu who grew more defiant as the trial progressed while the company accused her of soliciting the bribe. It was however disrupted several times by protestors who called for the liberation of Sinu.\n\nIn the end, councilmare Sinu was found guilty of corruption and sentenced to five year of prison and a fine. She was also banned for life from public office. The company involved was fined for a small sum.\n\nIn his speech, the judge condemned the politicisation of the case and issued a warning to the Kásan public. Harmony may only exist if all involved act in good faith and the public trusts the public officials to act virtuously. Corruption and bribery, even from those popular or well-intentioned, will sap at those foundation as surely as any slaver or knight of Opinicus. Justice may not be rendered properly if it is strong armed even with the best of intentions.\n\nUpon leaving the court of justice, the judge was booed by supporters of Sinu. In a shocking display of incivility, one supporter grabbed the judge’s briefcase to yell at him, forcing the judge to wrestle it back."
kasa.43.a:0 "A disappointing miscarriage of justice."

kasa.10.t:0 "The Wingalac Strike"
kasa.10.d:0 "The travel of the candidates to Seguro went down smoothly but when they arrived to the brand new public square where the debate would be held, they were welcomed by quarrelling citizens. It was hard for the candidates and the bystanders who had just arrived what to make of the unrest but as the candidates took place, the fight died down. However, one of the angry citizen spoke first to ask his question. He spoke of the current strike occuring at the Wingalac canned food plant. The strikers complained of low pay, lack of safety equipment and bad hours. However, they explained that the manager had his hooves tied for any bargaining because only the Macawian office had the ability to implement change in the company’s management. And for weeks now, the Macawian management of Wingalac refused to meet the workers in any way.\n\nÁltu Kexa intervened first, happily supporting the strikers for their brave stand against Wingalac. She called upon these foreign managers to leave their greed behind or perhaps the Kásans would decide that they would reserve their money for more respectable products. Pasararinha quickly intervened to denounce that kind of rhetoric as harmful and argued that the strike ought to used constructively, not as a political tool. He claimed that the Macawians were overall extremely responsible in their dealings and that Kásans could not expect to be paid a fortune when the average Kásan, rural or urban, often had to make do with less than them. Yrmthu criticized Pasarinha in kind, arguing that it would be insane to expect of Kásans to be content to live in misery. She could understand that a company’s means are limited, sure, but the fact that the management had failed to even meet once with the workers proved their bad faith and was unacceptable. The press then turned to Lûa Ramedi who explained that the strikers were certainly in their right but the issue was larger. With the law being unclear on such matters, he argued that a significant legislative change in the labor regulations was in order alongside a trade negotiation with Macawia at large. He asked both the strikers and Wingalac to ask responsibly and advised Wingalac to negotiate before the government decided for them."
kasa.10.a:0 "Lûa Ramedi won the day."
kasa.10.b:0 "Pasarinha was the voice of reason today."
kasa.10.c:0 "Yrmthu spoke the truth in this case."
kasa.10.e:0 "Áltu Kexa made the most sense."

kasa.47.t:0 "End of the Wingalac Strike"
kasa.47.d:0 "The Wingalac Strike that rocked the electoral campaign early on has finally come to a close this week. The workers resumed their activities after an agreement was reached between their representatives and the Wingalac managers sent from Macawia to negotiate. The deal includes a permanent representation of the worker on the company’s board meetings and more executive power being transferred to the Kásan branch to prevent the kind of stalemate that caused the strike to intensify in the first place. The deal includes a small reduction in working hours, the creation of safety guidelines and a formalization of the payment method.\n\nDespite being heavily politicized, the strike remained peaceful overall and while the public supported the movement, the strikers remained alone in the weeks that followed.\n\nAccording to some interviews that the press conducted among the workers, the agreement went a long way to restore some degree of trust between the company and the Wingalac management. The press releases of the company in Macawia also boasted about their good relationship with the workers. They also released a statement in the Kásan press stating that they hoped that the negotiation could serve as inspiration for any future legislative change in Kása."

Despite the striker’s demand for a meeting, the company’s management back in Macawia never visited the factory. Instead, they announced through the managers that pay would be raised and working hours would be cut. A manual of safety guidelines used in Macawian factories of Wingalac would also be translated into Kásan and Wittenlandic for use by the workers. The announcement put an end to the movement but some strikers wished to continue the fight. However, they were fired.\n\nThe strike was generally peaceful to the end despite some of the laid off workers threatening both the management and some former colleagues whom they considered to be “scabs”. It was also reported that the strike saw little support from the public after the initial politicisation of the issue.\n\nThe Wingalac management did not react much to the end of the strike in the press. Some journalists tried and conduct some interviews but few workers were willing to speak. Those who did said the situation was getting better but feared that strikes would only get harder if nozebra dared to force the management to sit down."
kasa.51.a:0 "At least, something came out of it."

kasa.52.t:0 "Undiplomatic Compliments"
kasa.52.d:0 "Today, a small controversy was caused by the release in the press of the interview with the Macawian ambassador. Overall, the interview was hardly problematic and the ambassador simply went through various consensual talking points. Eventually however, he spoke of the mutual benefits that would come from the relationship between Macawia and Kása “once First Commander Pasarinha is elected”. Pressed on this by the journalist, the ambassador walked back his statement in full, explaining that he misspoke because he had not gotten enough sleep. He claimed to mean “once the First Commander is elected” and that because he had just read an article speaking extensively about Pasarinha, he had a slip of the tongue. He went on to explain that he was reading extensively about all candidates, of course, and that it was only an unfortunate coincidence. Clearly not believing the explanation, the journalist wrote extensively about the awkwardness that followed as the ambassador kept denying he was endorsing Pasarinha in any shape or form.\n\nAfter the article was published, many became to talk about Pasarinha as the “candidate of Macawia” though very few went as far as to claim that Macawia would ever try and rig an election."
kasa.52.a:0 "Unfortunate."

kasa.53.t:0 "The Irmaos Deal"
kasa.53.d:0 "This week, the Macawian Irmaos company announced a deal with several small Kásan paper mills and printing companies to establish a large factory north of Seguro. The announcement came as a surprise as Irmaos had officially have up on reaching such a deal the previous year. Officially, the press communique of the company simply spoke of the incredible opportunities existing in Kása and of the welcoming atmosphere towards foreign investors.\n\nLater in the week, an investigative journalist wrote an article in which he summarized several interviews of employees of Irmaos and of the Kásan companies. Speaking under the condition of anonymity, some painted a less rosy picture than that of the Irmaos representatives. Less jobs would be created than announced even if the project was overall sound. Several of them also credited Pasarinha’s popularity in the election as a determinant facture in Irmaos’ decision though he was not personally involved."
kasa.53.a:0 "Excellent news!"

kasa.54.t:0 "Áltu Kexa Emerges From the Fray"
kasa.54.d:0 "With Pasarinha appearing more and more as the obvious choice for First Commander, many in Kása had started to see the election as a done deal. The average talk had gone from who to support to what would Pasarinha actually do once in charge, how would he deal with this or that. But not everyone saw “Kása’s accountan” as the best choice for First Commander. The longer he spoke, the more some people felt the lack of candor in his words, the dryness of it all. Sure, it made sense and it all felt very serious. But was that all there was to democracy?\n\nAnd so, more and more, citizens listened or read about Áltu Kexa’s speeches. There was so much fury in her words, so much righteous anger at everything that was going wrong in the world. And it’s not like the news painted a better picture of it all. Who could focus on the fine prints of trade policy when creatures were dying by the thousands in Prywhen or Longsword? When there were still slaves wasting away to fatten their masters in Nimbusia or Colthage? They ought to do something! And to some, it seemed as if Pasarinha who spoke so little of it, just didn’t care. But Áltu did and she would not let the accountant get coronated without a fight!"

kasa.55.d:0 "The Wingalac Strike that rocked the electoral campaign early on has finally come to a close this week. The workers resumed their activities after an agreement was reached between their representatives and the Wingalac managers sent from Macawia to negotiate. The deal mainly focus on a significant rise in pay for all workers though the deal also includes the implementation of some safety guidelines and a reduction in working hours.\n\nThe strike intensified after it became a national issue during the electoral campaign. Emboldened by public support, the strikers found numerous ways to ask Wingalac to finally send a negotiation team. It culminated in a moment of international solidarity with some Macawian workers protesting at the company’s headquarters. The Wingalac strike is seen by some as a watershed moment for the Kásan labor movement and there are rumors of wider unionization in the country.\n\nAccording to some interviews that the press conducted among the workers, the agreement has been welcomed and celebrated as a great victory. Back in Macawia, Wingalac attempted to not communicate on the outcome of the strike and downplay when they were forced to by the local press."

The strike spilled over in Seguro and Ilha Roca where supporters of the movement engaged in a boycott of the company and protested at the Macawian embassy. In a now emblematic moment, a few foals were caught by a photographer merrily painting a graffiti over a Wingalac ad in front of a Seguro general shop. While the protest remained peaceful, one of the negotiator was welcomed to one of the negotiation by rotten eggs thrown by supporters of the movement.\n\nAccording to some interviews that the press conducted among the workers, the agreement has been welcomed and celebrated as a great victory. Back in Macawia, Wingalac complained heavily for the lack of support of their government and of that of Kása in that negotiation. They also called the episode of the graffiti and the rotten egg as worrying signs of a crack in Kásan-Macawian relations."

kasa.19.d:0 "It was early in the afternoon when Àltu Kexa got on the stage of the Ilha Roca amphitheater. She was supposed to read some of her poems but her heart was not into it. They felt hollow and weak. The zebra looked at the crowd, eager to hear her speak. Was she supposed to give them all what they wanted? Something to feel good about themselves? She sighed and in a flash of clarity, threw her poems to the wind.\n\n“My dear compatriots,\n\nI wish to ask you all a question. Are we free? Do we deserve to be? The simple answer might be that we are and do because we can ask those questions. Freedom is not an alien concept nor is it a privilege that is to be gained. It is our birthright, our very natural state. Chains, debts and the very vocabulary of servitude, those are the constructs, those are the lies that deny us access to the real world and rob us of our potential.\n\nAs we speak, thousands upon thousands remain bound by those lies. In Gryphus, in Barrad, in Austurland, even in the Coalition of River hypocrites, lied to by knights, merchants, kings and so-called democratic leaders! Liars, all of them! And yet, these bound creatures have the right to think, to live, to yearn to be more because the words that would deny them those rights are but ink on paper!\n\nFor as long as it existed, Kasa has been an experiment in demonstrating this. Each day, our sisters and brothers of all walks of life get up and prove to the world at large that no life is so meaningless as to deserve to be reduced into slavery or serfdom. And yet, we have allowed this experiment to restrain itself. Mansu Erba has done many great things indeed, of that I cannot claim the contrary, but our Ava has let herself be swayed by the tepid and timid in her circle. And now, those meek of heart claim to lead us forward? Shame on us if we let that happen! Shame!\n\nKása! O Kása of my heart! How you deserve more! How the world deserves more than the champions of freedom to lie around, fat, feeble and idle. The slaves of the world deserve more resolve than to extend a hoof of peace to those who would see them enslave! In this cause of freedom, we need to be as fanatical as the knights of Opinicus, as entitled in our beliefs as the kings of Wittenland and as ruthless as those who would see us with iron around our hooves!\n\nMy name is Àltu Kexa and I hereby announce my candidacy for First Commander in the name of all who still reel under the yoke of tyranny!”"

luakasa.2.t:0 "What is Freedom?"
luakasa.2.d:0 ""One of the defining moments of my foalhood, one that I remember even today, is when my father brought home a book. It was a gift for my mother, yet I recall looking at it in the bookshelf, wondering what had made my mother so excited. I remember asking my parents what the signs over various shops said, piecing together what these strange symbols meant, and a few days after my fifth birthday I came walking into the kitchen, holding that book, and reading the title out loud: 'Number one Manehattan Herald Bestseller. A Forbidden Flame.'\n\nIt took me a long time to understand just why I was given cake on the condition that I never spoke of that book again, yet something about that stuck with me. Being able to read had given me cake, and if that was the case, what could I not gain from the countless other skills that education offered? Let this anecdote stand as evidence that I stand here not as some singular genius, but as a regular zebra who had the opportunities, and were motivated by interest far beyond anycreature's control. I wanted cake, later on I had good teachers who could nurture my growth, and then the joy instilled in me carried me through my education, and later employment, and in the end to this position.\n\nI do not plan to make any claims of being exceptional, the opposite, and I want to ask you this. What would a nation where everycreature could have the opportunities I had be like? Disregarding the brilliant minds of our academies, what of those trapped on their farms, or in the slums, or in a refugee camp, too starved to even think properly? How much is wasted simply because the ambitious, the driven, those who would have been the first to rise up alongside Akeeku himself, yet now find themselves trapped in a world where the answers are not as obvious?\n\nBreaking the chains is all well and good, but he who does not know the world around him, is forever in bondage. The challenges of Kása today lies not in a desperate revolt, but in education and training. The world is changing more and more, and we must equip out people to be ready for the world that awaits them. We do this not by firebrand speeches or valiant last stands, but by patient education and ceaseless improvement. We should raise not only freedom fighters, but engineers and scientists as well, and the quill is our weapon more than the sword ever was in this struggle.""
luakasa.2.a:0 "Education will free our minds!"

luakasa.3.t:0 "What Makes a Nation?"
luakasa.3.d:0 ""Once, recall reading this description of the difference between philosophy and politics. I cannot for the life of me recall where, precisely, I read this quote, or whether I have simply conjured it myself from faint memories and a desire to recall it as poignant, yet the gist of it was that philosophy concerns itself with what is true, and politics - if executed properly and under just leadership - is about implementing what is true onto the world.\n\nOne of the effects of this state of affairs, is that blind dogmatism by definition is cripped: it offers one answer, no matter the context. Conversely, a sober and sometimes dispassionate assessment of the state of affairs has been and will remain the best tool of any leader. As it stands, one of the key assessments to be made is this: there has never been as many challengers for the position of First Commander as there were in the past election. This is an unavoidable fact, yet what does it mean?\n\nIt means - I maintain - that the Kása of today is not the Kása founded by Akeeku, nor the Kása that my honored predecessor assumed leadership of. In prosperity, there has been change, and while desperate times call for the exceptional among us to assume leadership, prosperity and progress allows for the slower growing talents to be nurtured.\n\nWe all know the famous "potato decree", where Akeeku made the choice regarding Kása's central crop. It was not so that Kása would forever rely on potatoes, it was so that in those times of famine, Kása would have a reliable crop which could provide for us all. None would claim we are failing Kása by growing carrots, or lettuce, or apples. It is merely that in times of plenty, we can afford greater variety. I maintain that the same holds true in regards to leadership.\n\nMore and more Kásans stand tall enough to be a worthy first commander - I stood against three others who each would have led the nation well - and the more our nation prospers, the more this number will grow. For this reason, the time has come to rethink my position. The role of First Commander, that served us so well, is becoming more and more unsuited for a maturing Kása, one filled with informed, driven and able creatures who every day prove themselves not only able but willing to have a say in their fate. For this reason, Kása must reform. For this reason, the time has come to democratize her.""
luakasa.3.a:0 "Democracy secures our lives!"

luakasa.4.t:0 "What is Wealth?"
luakasa.4.d:0 ""As the Prudutu Projektu continues on, we are seeing not just a progress, but something much deeper, something that shows why this era has in Griffonia and Equus been called "the industrial revolution". The very conditions of our society are changing, and the things that once made some among us wealthy has come to fade into the background, forcing the old guard to compete in a new type of economical game.\n\nWhat is particularly obvious is the fact that with this progress our society has become more tightly linked than ever before, and that conditions for our people are changing fundamentally. This includes their economic conditions, and what once served them well is now found wanting. There was a time where giving the refugees crossing the border food, blankets and in the end a small patch of land to live off served them well, yet this is no longer the case.\n\nEconomists would speak of us transitioning from an agrarian to an industrial economy, and that patch of land might have provided food, but it does not provide money. It does not buy the foals clothes to wear to school - indeed school might become an issue when every hoof is needed on the farm. It does not provide for the comforts of modern life, nor does  it offer much in the way of options to better one's station in life.\n\nTo this end, it is imperative that new answers are offered by the Kásan government. When the majority of our people do not work their own land, but instead have taken employment for various companies, are we to leave them at the whims of their employers, who by necessity must be concerend with the bottom line? In an era where trade deals grow and become even more complex, can we truly rely on individual actors working on our behalf instead of uniting our efforts under one central trading authority?\n\nThese questions and more will need to be addressed, and the answers provided by the government will have to be such that they enrich the average Kásan. If Kása advances as a nation but leaves it people behind, then it is doomed to fail in the end.""

### General flavour and political events

kasa.38.t:0 "The Pequenos Príncipes Grumble" ##triggers at start of election process
kasa.38.d:0 "In the days following Mansu Erba’s resignation, many took the news with sadness but some quietly lashed out behind closed doors. These critics saw the whole idea of resignation as poor form and bad precedent. To them, it is essential for a First Commander to act until their death and anything less would be short of dereliction of duty. Some even worried of the consequences of the coexistence of two first commanders.\n\nAmong those critics are the Pequenos Principes. Those families descendant of former tribal nobility sold into slavery became a fixture of Kasan society. Early on, those freed slaves swore to relinquish any claim to power or privilege. Instead, they turned to cultural work, acting as archivists, historians and particularly funeral directors. Since the creation of the role of First Commander, they played an important ceremonial role in the transfer of power as the funerals of the previous First Commander traditionally coincided with the nomination with their successor. Therefore, a cynical rebuttal of their critics would be that Mansu’s resignation effectively meant that the Pequenos Principes would have no participation in the ceremonies.\n\nThose complains have failed to gain any popularity however. After all, everyone in Kása knows that Mansu Erba’s venerable age means that her death is near anyway."
kasa.38.a:0 "Let her enjoy her twilight years."

kasa.39.t:0 "A Light On The Lakeside" ##Mansu Erba's death in 1010.9.16
kasa.39.d:0 "Mansu Erba’s death prompted many in Kása to call for a countrywide celebration but those calls were quickly silenced. It was announced that in her final wishes, she requested to not be buried with national honors but rather have a small private funeral. She was to go on a pyre outside of Segura, by her family country home next to a small lake.\n\nWhen the day came, the Pequenos Principes had prepared everything to make sure that the pyre would be well-prepared. All of Mansu’s family had come to assist. However, when the time came for the pyre to be lit, a stream of creatures slowly made their way towards the home. The family quickly recognized a lot of them. They were Mansu Erba’s “netos”, the freed slaves who Mansu had saved during her days as a Skapatoria agent and their families. The Pequenos Principes directing the funeral scrambled to try and prevent the newly arrived from disturbing the ceremony and upsetting the mourning family. However, as one of them turned to the husband of Mansu, he simply gestured to let them come. And so, one by one, they came to put flowers next to the unlit pyre to say goodbye to the zebra they owed their freedom too. Zebras, ponies, griffons, deers and so many others. Soon, it became clear that the Netos did not come alone. Many more had heard the rumor and came too. Refugees from Barrad and Gryphus but also simple citizens. Those others Kásans however did not join Mansu’s Netos. Instead, they remained on the shore of the lake opposed to the lake and put their flowers in the water, gently pushing them away.\n\nIt took a long time for the procession to end and the night was falling when the pyre could at last be lit. Mansu’s widow was supposed to lit the fire but, overwhelmed as he was, he couldn't and so, her children took his place. When the flames of the pyre started to rise, all could see on the hills nearby small lights appearing. First some and them hundreds and hundreds of little lights in the night, hundreds who came to accompany the Avo di Kasa, their grandmother in her final journey."
kasa.39.a:0 "Thank you Mansu. Thank you and farewell."

kasa.40.t:0 "The Good Soldier" ##flavour event about Private Hasek
kasa.40.d:0 ""Haseeeeeek!" the sergeant bellowed in his face. "What did you do, you half-wit?! WHY ARE FIFTH COMPANY'S MACHINE GUNS OUT OF ORDER?!"\n\n"Because if the enemy equipment is non-functional, it cannot be used against you!" Hasek explained, saluting his sergeant and smiling widely as he quoted General Lobu. "And Fifth company was to be our opponent in this exercise!" he continued, the Sergeant about to blow a gasket.\n\n"You absolute nitwit! I will have you scrubbing floors until you're nothing but a stripey rag! Drop down and start giving me push ups, do not stop until I order you to!"\n\n"Yes sergeant!" Hasek obeyed, instantly dropping down and beginning to do his pushups, not stopping - though he did look up - when he heard the sergeant yell. "General!" Looking to the side, he saw how none other than General Solano Lobu had approached, the sergeant stiffly saluting him.\n\n"So tell me sergeant, were fifth company's machineguns sabotaged?" The general asked.\n\n"Sir, yes, sir!" The sergeant replied. "Private Hasek was on maintenance duty, and he removed the firing pins from the weapons!" \n\n"Interesting... now tell me, were the troops informed this was a live fire exercise, that for all intents and purposes should be treated as war?"\n\n"Sir yes sir!"\n\n"I see..." the general pursed his lips and looked down to Hasek, who saluted him with one hoof before going back to his pushups."Come with me, private. I have some questions."\n\n"Sir yes sir I will be with you the moment the sergeant says I am done here!" Hasek replied enthusiastically, leaving General Lobo to raise an eyebrow and the sergeant to facehoof in silence behind him."
kasa.40.a:0 ""Just stop and go with the general...""

kasa.41.t:0 "Of Public Squares" ## Of Public Squares
kasa.41.d:0 "Since the early days, Kasa had long dedicated itself to democracy and robust open square debates. Even when it was a small village of runaway slaves, Seguro’s main square acted as a public forum in election times, where citizens could freely interact with their would-be leaders.\n\nBut what allowed kasan democracy to thrive in the early days aged poorly as the population grew and territory was gained. Whereas a Suguroan could simply walk to the city’s main square to attend a public debate, those living on the Fireshore or elsewhere in the inner lands could hardly be expected to travel all the way to the capital for a political discussion. The fear of seeing Kasa’s democracy a strictly Seguro-centric affair had been an increasingly pressing headache throughout Mansu Erba’s term.\n\nThe candidates to succeed Mansu Erba met and agreed to find some way to resolve the issue. Their solution was twofold. First, they would travel together to all the greatest cities of Kasa to hold various debates in those cities as well. As to make sure that none of them could be held back on the tricky Kasan roads, they would travel together. Secondly, they would be followed by a press corps of journalists whose newspaper agreed to transcript the whole debate in their newspaper. It was an expensive solution but one that would have to do, even if it wouldn’t do much good to illiterate and rural Kasan, of which there was plenty."

kasa.43.t:0 "The Little Readers" ## event where a literate citizens reads news to an illiterate crowd
kasa.43.d:0 "With the electoral campaign in full swing, few continued to worry about the participation in the most remote or illiterate communities. They had done their best with what meager means they had. However, one journalist decided to one day travel to some of those communities to see how they fared in this election. He was very surprised upon arriving at the scene that many citizens were not only aware of some of the issue discussed at the electoral debates but were voicing their own opinions on the most recent controversies just like their urban and literate compatriots. Perhaps even somewhat more so.\n\nIt was only when he settled at the local bar for his meal that he understood what had happened. During his meal, he noticed a zebra entering the bar with a copy of his own newspaper. Upon his entry, he saluted the patrons and sat down while the bar went quiet. He then proceeded to read the entire electoral debate and other news to the patrons who all listened attentively. Some creatures even entered the bar specifically to listen to the newspaper only to leave afterwards."

The zebra stallion was born to the political elite of Seguro, coming from a long line and venerated lineage of councillors and bureaucrats. His ancestor had gained fame as Sínora Pon’s camp-aide. Through his family, Lûa knew Mansu Erba from his childhood and, in turn, the First Commander found him to be a sharp-minded colt.\n\nAfter an education overseas in Macawia, Lûa attempted to pursue a career in the burgeoning civil service yet a single letter changed his life; an invitation from the First Commander to become her secretary. A position that he accepted at once. This led Lûa Ramedi to Kásan politics, aiding Mansu in drafting speeches and legislation amongst other tasks where his dutifulness didn’t go unnoticed. Through Mansu, his name gained prominence amongst the councillors and as the old First Commander continued to rely on him more, the writing on the wall was clear — Lûa Ramedi was Mansu Erba’s designated successor.\n\n After Mansu Erba’s sudden resignation and retirement, most of the Advisory Council flocked to Lûa Ramedi, to the stallion’s surprise. During the election, he led a campaign centered around safeguarding Mansu Erba’s heritage and, in the end, the former secretary’s political connections and ableness proved their worth.\n\nNow, as the new First Commander, Lûa Ramedi seeks to continue the path paved by Mansu Erba in forming an unified Kása as a modern, democratic nation."

ZES_military_blocked:0 "Outdated Military Formation"

This ad-hoc system is not capable of meeting the demands of modern warfare and recent reforms by Mansu Erba have consolidated smaller regional units into formal garrison forces, forming the first permanent ground forces in Kása's history.\n\nEven then, Kása, formally at least, has no official standing army and this limits the government's authority in raising any new forces."

### Diplomatic ideas

mansu_erba_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 7th May 931 in Seguro\n\n§YBiography§!:Born second child to a farmer family, Mansu Erba grew in the vast farmlands just outside the capital Seguro, spending her youth exploring nature. Unlike her peers, she and her siblings received basic education from their parents, learning to read and write. As Mansu’s elder brother would inherit the farm, she had to find life elsewhere and so Mansu left for the capital, to live and work at a shop owned by relatives. However, this life was not to be as she enlisted in 950 in a Macawian military program which she graduated from in 954. As a sub-teniente, her cleverness earned her the attention of the Skapatoria Programa.\n\nFor three years, she worked as an undercover agent in Austurland, Wittenland and Nimbusia, where she helped many escaping to freedom. Mansu proved herself to be a capable operative and in 957, she rose to fame for her actions in Austurland as she lead the escape of over a hundred thralls despite taking a musket ball to her gut. She received a hero’s welcome at Seguro and an award for her self-sacrifice from the First Commander. Sadly, the musket ball that made her a hero also prevented her from ever working as an operative again. At the hospital, the recovering zebra would meet her future husband, a widowed doctor, and the two would be married two years later. In 960 the Advisory Council elections saw Mansu chosen as a councillor of Seguro.\n\nWhile Kása had continued to prosper, in 967 the Barrad Crisis erupted. As streams of refugees trickled into Kása, the First Commander of the time suffered a stroke. As the crisis worsened, an emergency election in the council saw Mansu Erba narrowly elected as the First Commander. She acted swiftly, diverting all funds from industrialisation programs and appealing to Macawia for aid. Kása suffered from it but it endured, their founding ideals upheld as Mansu argued to the critics. After all, is a factory worth betraying oneself?\n\nDespite the hardships in the following decades, Kása chose to trust in its timely hero and under Mansu’s leadership, Kása slowly recovered from the crisis thanks to extensive literacy and economic reform programs. Now, she is known as A avo di Kása —Kása’s Grandmother.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Printik"

lua_ramedi_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 11th March 972 in Seguro\n\n§YBiography§!:Lûa Ramedi’s political career has been defined by his service and loyalty to Mansu Erba. The zebra stallion was born to the political elite of Seguro, coming from a long line and venerated lineage of councillors and bureaucrats. His ancestor had gained fame as Sínora Pon’s camp-aide. Through his family, Lûa knew Mansu Erba from his childhood and, in turn, the First Commander found him to be a sharp-minded colt.\n\nAfter an education overseas in Macawia, Lûa attempted to pursue a career in the burgeoning civil service yet a single letter changed his life; an invitation from the First Commander to become her secretary. A position that he accepted at once. This led Lûa Ramedi to Kásan politics, aiding Mansu in drafting speeches and legislation amongst other tasks where his dutifulness didn’t go unnoticed. Through Mansu, his name gained prominence amongst the councillors and as the old First Commander continued to rely on him more, the writing on the wall was clear — Lûa Ramedi was Mansu Erba’s designated successor.\n\n After Mansu Erba’s sudden resignation and retirement, most of the Advisory Council flocked to Lûa Ramedi, to the stallion’s surprise. During the election, he led a campaign centered around safeguarding Mansu Erba’s heritage and, in the end, the former secretary’s political connections and ableness proved their worth.\n\nNow, as the new First Commander, Lûa Ramedi seeks to continue the path paved by Mansu Erba in forming an unified Kása as a modern, democratic nation.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Riley"

yrmthu_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 3rd July 979 in Oferclif, Bymnonia\n\n§YBiography§!:One cannot always tell a creature’s fate based on their origins. Born to a family of Barrad refugees, Yrmthu’s entire life has been shaped by events prior to her birth; while her family had been just simple serfs living in the Barrad valleys, the crisis caused by the Pentarchy’s rise led to her parents only narrowingly escaping the chaos. Her childhood was spent growing up in Oferclif, where many refugees were settled by Kása. Although originally a Wittenlandic pony, speaking wittenlandic as her mother tongue, young Yrmthu learnt kásan fast, enabling her to pursue rudimentary education in both languages. Despite showing prowess and intellect, she did not pursue higher education even when offered the chance. She instead began to aid her fellow refugees in anyway she could. Over the years her focus moved to coordinating the aid efforts and acting as a middle-mare between the government and camp representatives.\n\nIt was during her work that Yrmthu began to slowly developed an unique political philosophy. She adored Kása’s harmonic values of individual liberty and the democratic institution that ensured equality of all. Yet she saw the value of local communities and disliked how political capital was entirely centered in Seguro, with municipalities having little say in affairs that concerned themselves. Her localist ideology gained some ground in the northern states and culminated in her election to councilor of Oferclif in 999. Despite her reservations, Yrmthu was a staunchly loyalist to Mansu Erba’s policies and kept her criticisms to the parlay rooms for most part. Her biggest political victory was the passage of the Petition Act in 1002 which enable local communities to directly petition the First Commander.\n\nWhen Mansu Erba retired, Yrmthu did not initially intend to run, feeling her position wasn’t entirely secure. But when a group of fellow localist councillors approached her and pledged to aid her, she couldn’t deny their request. With their aid and her campaign tour’s success, her election saw a turning point in Kása’s history; for the first time, a non-zebra was the First Commander. And in her new position, she intend to reform not simply Kásan politics but the society itself.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Printik"

ZES_solano_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: December 16th, 965, Ilha Rosca\n\n§YBiography§!:Born to a zebra mother and a pony father, Solano Lobu was born in interesting times. Two years after his birth, the Barrad crisis erupted in Kása. Lobu's father, a low-level government worker, was swamped with work and didn't get to spend much time with his son. Constantly advocating for assisting the refugees, showing charity, and doing everything he could to improve their lives. So, Solano spent most of his early years with his mother. She was a proud citizen and instilled in him an admiration for all those doing their part to serve the freedom Kása offered to all, including his father.\n\nIn order to follow on this legacy, Solano signed up for military training in Macawia, hoping to return and serve his nation proudly. After his stint at a Macawian military academy, where he performed excellently, he returned to his home of Ilha Rosca and became its local militia coordinator. He was happy with his domestic service, but little did he know, people higher up had their eyes on him.\n\nIn 991, Mansu Erba tapped the local commander to begin organizing the national network of militias in Kása into something that could be called an army. Solano accepted this duty, and continues his work to this day. While having little combat experience, he is a master organizer and logistician, and hopes with all his heart that his work can benefit his proud nation in some way.\n\n§CHis father is very proud of him.§!\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Sesek"

ZES_wojtek_desc:0 "§gDepending from where in the world does one hail, bears are either simple animals or a race of arrogant warriors. There are exceptions of course, but Wojtek is unique even among those.\n\n Little is known of his past, and the bear himself is unwilling to tell. This and countless rumors, have turned Wojtek into somewhat of a pseudo-mythical figure. What is known is that Wojtek is a Gryphussian brown bear, a species hunted by Opinicus knights for sport. When he was but a cub, Wojtek lost his mother to Opinicus hunters and would have been slain himself, but was saved by Gryphussian partisans from Kasa.This band of guerrillas adopted the bear, giving him the name "Wojtek". However, during an engagement, the bear was separated from the unit.\n\nYears later griffon refugees in Kasa would start telling strange stories of a bear who would protect Gryphussians fleeing the Free Towns. Similar tales would come from partisans who claimed a great ursine was slaying their enemies with a cannon it wielded as if it was a mere rifle. The leadership of Kasa would remain sceptical however, until the so called "Liberator Bear" himself arrived into Kasa one day. He introduced himself as Wojtek and pledged to fight for the Kasa Free State in order to help liberating the Gryphussians - his nation and saving the brown bears - his species .\n\nWhile initially reluctantly accepted into the Kasan military as a private, Wojtek was quickly promoted into the position of corporal and eventually into the ranks of generals, due to physical ability, mental fortitude, unexpected expertise in artillery and surprisingly for a such a predator - great care for soldiers serving under him.\n\nWojtek now stands as one of the lesser unifying figures of Gryphussians in Kasa, who now believe that liberation of their homeland is at hand as even it’s nature is turning against it’s oppressors.§!"
