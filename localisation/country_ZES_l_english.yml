zeeb.14.t:0 "Taking Prisoners"
zeeb.14.d:0 "With the main force of Pegasi dealt with, the troops are easily able to capture any civilians or soldiers that are still running around.

zeeb.16.t:0 "Hold them Back" 
zeeb.16.d:0 "The Pegasi Line clashes against the troops, and for a few moments there's intense battle. That quickly ends with a few clever moves on the Pegasi's part as the Zebra line quickly crumbles, leaving huge pockets in the line that the Pegasi eagerly exploit. It doesn't take much longer for the rest of the warriors to be killed, or to send them into a retreat. Worst of all, in the fighting, Khalfani was killed!"
zeeb.16.a:0 "Retreat!"
zeeb.16.b:0 "Take what we can and leave!"

zeeb.17.t:0 "Take What We Can"
