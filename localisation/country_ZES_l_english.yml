zeeb.9.a:0 "Onward to Sao Macaw!" #Leads to 10

zeeb.10.t:0 "Outside Sao Macaw"
zeeb.10.d:0 "A few hours later, our fleet has finally arrived at Sao Macaw. The city with its fine beaches, white towers and endless palm trees sits unaware of coming raid, as are the Macawian Navy. Our cannons have been prepped and are currently loading, and the landing parties are currently getting landing to at the shore before attacking."
zeeb.10.a:0 "ALL GUNS, FIRE!" #Leads to 11

zeeb.11.t:0 "Bombardment of Sao Macaw"
zeeb.11.d:0 "Within minutes of our fire, the city is already in chaos. The relentless barrage continues for far longer, until most of the buildings on the coastline have been demolished or set aflame. Once our barrage finally ends, our ships rush towards the city and start unload main raiding parties. "
zeeb.11.a:0 "Forwards! into the breach!"  #Leads to 12

zeeb.12.t:0 "Assault on Sao Macaw"
zeeb.12.d:0 "Our warriors rush out from the ships and start attacking the local and military police forces that put up a pathetic resistance, striking them down and fanning out like a great storm-wave. Raiders manage to kill most of armed parrots, but for every we kill, two more comes from deeper parts of the city to face us, it seems they are trying to form a line..."
zeeb.12.a:0 "CHARGE!" #Leads to 13
zeeb.12.b:0 "Keep them back!"

zeeb.13.t:0 "The Enemy has Crumbled!"
zeeb.13.d:0 "With a well-timed charge, the entire line that the parrots had tried to form breaks under our assault. Soon afterwards, our brave warriors easily manage to mop up what is left of any resistance to us around the coastline, and continue onward into the city."
zeeb.13.a:0 "Start ensl... taking prisoners."

zeeb.14.t:0 "Taking Prisoners"
zeeb.14.d:0 "With the main force of the Polícia Militar do Estado dealt with, our raiders are easily able to capture any parrots that are left around. The sheer size of the city, combined with the fact that most of the exits are either left ruined after our fire, or are clogged up with fleeing parrots, leaves the our warriors a great deal of time to take what they want, and capture some prisoners."
zeeb.14.a:0 "Load them on board, and head back home."

zeeb.15.t:0 "Nimbusia in Flames!" ### Event for River Fed
zeeb.15.d:0 "Four hours ago, a messenger hailing from Nimbusia came bearing terrible news. The City of Nimbusia is under assault by zebra pirates! A swift response was assembled, but sadly, they arrived too late. The relief force that arrived found the city to be half empty, ruined, and aflame, the only ones who have survived were those hiding up in the clouds, away from the fighting."
zeeb.15.a:0 "We cannot let them get away with this!"
zeeb.15.b:0 "We must take a rational response."
zeeb.15.c:0 "Make a formal protest."

zeeb.16.t:0 "Hold them Back" 
zeeb.16.d:0 "The newly-assembled parrot line clashed against our warriors and an intense battle ranged. The heavily armed Polícia Militar do Estado struck down our warriors with machine guns and even an armoured car. Trucks and motorcycles ferried reinforcements behind our line, catching the rear guard by surprise. With parrots almost encircling our troops, it didn't take long for the rest of our raiders to be killed or sent into retreat.\n\nOur brave leader Khalfani raised his sword but was cut down by a hail of rifle fire from the cowardly parrots. His warriors defended his body until they too drew their last breath."
zeeb.16.a:0 "SOUND THE RETREAT!"
zeeb.16.b:0 "Take what we can and leave!"

zeeb.17.t:0 "Take What We Can" 
zeeb.17.d:0 "Under order from Chane Haoniyao, the remaining raiders grab what they can, including any loot and parrots they can get their hooves on, and rush back onto the ships. Unfortunately, many of our warriors are lost in this desperate rush back on board, but by some broad stroke of luck, most of them manage to make it back intact."
zeeb.17.a:0 "Head home as fast as possible."

zeeb.18.t:0 "An Emergency Meeting"
zeeb.18.d:0 "With the death of our glorious King, Khalfani just a few days ago, it is imperative that the nation figure out who will rule as High Admiral in his stead. There are two promising candidates, Zwelikudei and Mnqobi. Both aspiring captains in the fleet, they have proven themselves in battle several times before, and manifest to their skills is the fact that they managed to survive the raid on Sao Macaw."
zeeb.18.a:0 "Zwelikude shall be the new High Admiral."
zeeb.18.b:0 "Mnqobi shall make a fine High Admiral."

zeeb.19.t:0 "New Captains"
zeeb.19.d:0 "Following Zwelikudei's recent reforms, he has promoted several promising zebra's within the fleet, elevating them to a higher position. "
zeeb.19.a:0 "Great."

zeeb.20.t:0 "New Generals"
zeeb.20.d:0 "Citing the severe lack of any great ground presence, beyond the marines that the navy currently has, Zwelikudei has begun promoting several great warriors and leaders to lead the army as generals. "
zeeb.20.a:0 "Great."

zeeb.21.t:0 "Dealing with the Deer"
zeeb.21.d:0 "One of the many questions that have plagued us for a long time is what to do with the Deer. The small nation to our east remains mostly neutral and quiet, the deer there content to worship their gods in peace. Now though many have been advocating either outright annexing their nation, or incorporating them as a puppet."
zeeb.21.a:0 "We need their lands, annex them."
zeeb.21.b:0 "They need the protection, puppet them."

zeeb.22.t:0 "Revenge"
zeeb.22.d:0 "[ZES.GetLeader] has decided to take revenge for the death of Khalfani and has gathered a massive fleet to do so. There are almost over a thousand zebra's in this grand fleet, each one ready and willing to take revenge upon the parrots of Sao Macaw for killing the great leader Khalfani."
zeeb.22.a:0 "Back to Sao Macaw!"


zeeb.23.t:0 "Back at Sao Macaw"
zeeb.23.d:0 "Our fleet arrives at Sao Macaw not much later, with each ship sailing up towards the shore and bringing with them hundreds of the finest warriors. Chants of 'Khalfani!' Echo throughout our fleet, filling the air with a great and terrible noise."
zeeb.23.a:0 "Assault the city!"


zeeb.24.t:0 "Second Raid of Sao Macaw"
zeeb.24.d:0 "Our troops rush into the city with reckless abandon, attacking almost everything within sight. As the fighting starts, many great fires are lit, swallowing up entire buildings and filling the sky with smoke. The fires are still somewhat small, giving many parrots the chance to put them out. Many captains want to burn the entire city down, all they need is confirmation first."
zeeb.24.a:0 "Burn it all down!"

zeeb.25.t:0 "The Fire Rises"
zeeb.25.d:0 "With the captains orders, the city is set alight. Zebras can be seen almost everywhere, lighting fires and cackling madly as the city burns. In just a few minutes most of the buildings along the coast are aflame, and in just a few hours it'll all burn down. "
zeeb.25.a:0 "Revenge is a dish best served hot."

zeeb.27.t:0 "A Good Haul"
zeeb.27.d:0 "We've sent out a fleet not too long ago to capture equipment and take slaves, now they've returned with plenty of loot and slaves to be sold in the market."

zeeb.32.a:0 "Good haul."

zeeb.33.t:0 "The City of Minotauria"
zeeb.33.d:0 "As the morning sun rises up in the sky, our fleet approaches the city of Minotauria. The waters are calm, and due to the early hour we've arrived at, only a few of the Minotaurs are actually up and awake. A hush falls upon the fleet as several of our ships move forwards into the city's port. Then, the chaos begins."
zeeb.33.a:0 "Attack!"

zeeb.34.t:0 "Attacking Minotauria"
zeeb.34.d:0 "Our warriors fall upon the city like a hungry beast being presented with a feast, nothing is left untouched. Scores of minotaurs are herded onto our boats whilst fierce fighting goes on deeper within the city. Slowly and steadily do our cargo holds fill up with hundreds of Minotaur, the fleet having a bit of trouble keeping up with the sheer amount of people we're taking."
zeeb.34.a:0 "Just as planned."

zeeb.35.t:0 "End of the Raid"
zeeb.35.d:0 "About two hours or so later, our ships have finally been filled to the brim. Our warriors start retreating, heading back on board while fending off any Minotaurs who still have some fight left in them. Just as quickly as we arrived do we set off, back home to Nyumbampya. "
zeeb.35.a:0 "Another great raid."

zeeb.36.t:0 "Minotauria Burns!"
zeeb.36.d:0 "Earlier today, the City of Minotauria was raided by a large fleet of zebra slavers! They snuck in as the night fell, and within hours they had assaulted the city and fled with hundreds of innocent Minotaurs taken as captives. The fleet attempted to chase them, but they were too fast."
zeeb.36.a:0 "Oh no!"
