ZES_council_convenes:0 "The Advisory Council's Final Session"
ZES_council_convenes_desc:0 "As our nation prepares for elections to the Kásan Advisory Council, the council has gathered one last time to sort out its closing business. Many members wish to speak and report on the nation's programs and efforts to come to the modern age. But first, the First Commander shall call the council to order."

ZES_livru_programa:0 "Livru Programa"
ZES_livru_programa_desc:0 "One of the foremost goals that our nation has been working towards for many years now is the issue of illiteracy. This has been one of the initiatives championed by Mansu Erba, and so the First Commander has promising results to deliver to the council."

ZES_xatisa_relief:0 "Xatisa Relief"
ZES_xatisa_relief_desc:0 "While we would love it if this meeting could be only sunshine and good feelings, it is time to discuss the dragon in the room. Our nation possesses a serious issue in the form of Barrad refugees. A report on the situation is due from First Commander."

ZES_prudutu_projektu:0 "Prudutu Projektu"
ZES_prudutu_projektu_desc:0 "While many upon this continent would call us backward and primitive, we have made steps forward in the modernization of our nation. The First Commander and Councilor Pasarinha will address the council on this subject."

ZES_friend_macawia:0 "Our Dearest Macawia"
ZES_friend_macawia_desc:0 "The nation of Macawia holds a dear place in the hearts of all in Kása, and our connection to them is the strongest we have with any foreign power. The ambassador to Macawia is due to give his remarks to the Kásan."

ZES_dread_neighbours:0 "Our Dreaded Neighbours"
ZES_dread_neighbours_desc:0 "We are surrounded on all sides by regimes that may wish to see us wiped out. The dangerous Barrad, the unpredictable Austurland, and threatening Gryphus; add onto this that the River Federation sees our lands as a possible threat to their union. The first commander shall speak on this to steady the hearts of the people."

ZES_council_disbands:0 "First Commander's Closing Statement"
ZES_council_disbands_desc:0 "As the council stacks their papers and prepares to return to their election preparations, all of the councilors await the closing remarks of their First Commander. She has led them through much, and they cling to every word.\n\nSo let us see what she has to say."

ZES_election:0 "Elição"
ZES_election_desc:0 "The time for elections has finally come, and it seems they will be more impactful than anycreature thought possible. All the citizens of Kása shall go to their town or village center, and vote for the fate of their nation."

ZES_expand_literacy_campaign:0 "Expand Literacy Campaign"
ZES_expand_literacy_campaign_desc:0 "Knowledge can free you. Knowledge that resistance was possible led to our predecessors rising up. Knowledge of its existence led to thousands risking everything in the hunt for freedom. Yet the world demands more than these things, and if Kása is to remain the shining beacon of freedom she always were, then her people must be educated."

ZES_soup_kitchens:0 "Warm Soup For the Hungry"
ZES_soup_kitchens_desc:0 "The steady influx of refugees from the north is not just a matter of suffering and pain, but of poor organization too. We offer aid to those who come here, but it is disjointed, disorganized and inefficient. A desperate refugee starving because of poor organization is a betrayal of what Kása is. For all those who come here, yearning to breathe free, we have to do better."

ZES_formalize_book_drives:0 "Formalizar as Doações di Livros"
ZES_formalize_book_drives_desc:0 "The charity of countless Kásans have helped us hugely in the battle against illiteracy, yet charity unsupported by structures and oversight is inefficient and wasteful. There should be no hesitation for anycreature about where to go, nor what books are needed, and every last book donated should be put to good use."

ZES_call_upon_expats:0 "Call Upon the Expats"
ZES_call_upon_expats_desc:0 ""...and though you all now reside beyond the borders of Kása, where I hope that life treats you well, I nevertheless wish to ask for your help. Whether by your return, or by your expertise Kása would greatly benefit from your contributions. We are all Kása, and we can all elevate her."\n-First Commander Lûa Ramedi"    

ZES_implore_nation:0 "Implore Kása"
ZES_implore_nation_desc:0 "As we did during the Battle of Ebyron, we must rally as a nation to address the Xatisa. The average citizen must be implored to help house the refugees, to open their larders to help feed them and to watch the paths out of Barrad to aid those in need. Only together can we truly address this crisis."

ZES_wagon_schools:0 "Escolas Móveis"
ZES_wagon_schools_desc:0 "So many of our people live beyond the cities and towns, and we do not have teachers or schools enough to cover every last village. Instead of ignoring them, we should formalize a program of mobile schools, which can cover greater areas and let the little ones be taught closer to home."

ZES_ink_and_bread:0 "Tinta e Padrão"
ZES_ink_and_bread_desc:0 "Nourishment is everything for a student to learn well, and proper educational tools is as essential to truly prosper. The apex of Lûa Ramedi's great literacy campaign will set in stone the rights of all Kásans to both these things. There can be no excuses for failure. Our people will be fed and educated, period."

ZES_meet_with_yrmthu:0 "Meet With Yrmthu"
ZES_meet_with_yrmthu_desc:0 "If there is anyone who embodies Kása it is Yrmthu, a once starving refugee who now has risen to become one of Kása's greatest leaders. Her zealous dedication to the people is admirable, and if she would be willing to take a place in our cabinet she would be a great asset."

ZES_meet_with_pasarinha:0 "Meet With Pasarinha"
ZES_meet_with_pasarinha_desc:0 "The modern world waits for no one, and Pasarinha is just the kind of asset we need to make sure Kása can face down the challenges of the modern era. In an age of industry, we must be able to think big, and he can help us with this."

ZES_instill_trust:0 "Instill Trust"
ZES_instill_trust_desc:0 "Lûa Ramedi is many things, but a firebrand speaker is not one of them. His skill has always been more in the administrative and the organizational field, and to instill confidence in the people, he has chosen to simply get to work, decisively moving to address many issues that have piled up in recent years. Bureaucracy and maintenance isn't attractive, but it is necessary."

ZES_intellectual_advisors:0 "Intellectual Advisors"
ZES_intellectual_advisors_desc:0 "Different times call for different skill-sets. Gone is the day where brave fighters or canny smugglers were what Kása needed. Now it needs engineers, scientists and scholars. Thankfully, Lûa Ramedi has taken careful notes during his many years of service, and he knows just the kind of creatures to call upon."

ZES_economic_advisors:0 "Economic Advisors"
ZES_economic_advisors_desc:0 "A strong Kása must have a strong economy. A strong economy will give the people jobs, it will allow us to field a stronger army and it will allow us to master our own fates. This will not happen on its own though, and we must make sure to listen carefully to those who know how to navigate these particular waters."

ZES_shared_responsibility:0 "Equilíbrio di Poder"
ZES_shared_responsibility_desc:0 "As Kása advances, new powers emerge within her, powers that could change her for the worse. These challenges aren't overcome by heroic last stands or personal risk, but by a strong yet rule-bound apparatus of state, in which the average civil servant feels a stake in doing things the right way."

ZES_continue_projektu:0 "Continue Projektu"
ZES_continue_projektu_desc:0 "The Prudutu Projektu is one of Mansu Erba's great accomplishments, and though it is tempting to expand and accelerate it, the steady progress that has been made is not to be scoffed at. To gamble with the progress made would be irresponsible, and it is better to make good use of the progress being made."

ZES_implore_affluent:0 "Appeal To the Affluents"
ZES_implore_affluent_desc:0 "There are many in Kása who have managed to build a great life for themselves, and though we would not dream to begrudge them their success, it is hard to avoid the fact that when you have a lot, you would rather keep it. Convincing the wealthy to help out is different from convincing the poor, yet it can still be done."

ZES_bridges_and_roads:0 "Pontes Sobre Ilhas"
ZES_bridges_and_roads_desc:0 "A bridge is a strong symbol for unity and progress both. It lets even the poorest cross on the same terms as the richest, it allows for the flow of commerce and industry and it opens up formerly isolated regions to the rest of the nation."

ZES_invest_local_civilian:0 "Support Local Companies"
ZES_invest_local_civilian_desc:0 "Kása shall stand on its own four hooves, that has never been up for debate. Those zebras and ponies who toil away in their workshops and stores could become so much more, if we only make sure to give them a helping hoof."

ZES_hire_refugees:0 "Employment Opportunities Act"
ZES_hire_refugees_desc:0 "Our people need jobs, but one cannot simply jump into a job cannon to be fired off into job land where jobs grow on jobbies. A more sober view of the situation acknowledges that some need only to be put in contact with prospective employers, but some need training, some need guidance, and all need actual opportunities."

ZES_open_our_ports:0 "Abri Nossas Portus"
ZES_open_our_ports_desc:0 "Kása is not an island unto herself, and her limited resources mean that she needs to embrace the world in order to prosper. We have the location for it, and if we make sure to embrace our naval heritage, we can build ourselves into a naval power both economically and militarily."

ZES_projektu_tera:0 "Projektu Tera"
ZES_projektu_tera_desc:0 "Much of Kasa is still untamed wilderness and underdeveloped countryside where little has been accomplished. This, too, shall change though. With the Kásan economy invigorated, we have the resources and the expertise to begin the first ever development project not of Seguro, or Ilha Rosca, but of all Kása."

ZES_deal_with_jarl:0 "Lidar Com Austurland"
ZES_deal_with_jarl_desc:0 "The deer to the east have been a concern for Kása for as long as we can remember. At times there has been peace, yet at times their raiders have savaged our lands. Until now we have not been in a position to deal with the matter for good, yet between our rapid growth in recent years as well as the changes in Austurland, the time has finally come to address the issue on a more permanent basis."

ZES_free_minds_and_hearts:0 "Free Minds and Hearts"
ZES_free_minds_and_hearts_desc:0 "One of the key freedoms of all creatures is the freedom of opportunity, and in order to have the most opportunities in the modern world, knowledge is essential. We must learn, we must understand, and we must grow. This is the duty of all free creatures, and we shall not waver."

ZES_monument:0 "Monument of the Downtrodden"
ZES_monument_desc:0 "Kása has many reasons to be proud of its accomplishments, and its defenders should be honored. Yet, it would be easy to throw up a tacky statue to honor and service and courage. Too easy, in fact. War is not like that, and it would be wrong to whitewash it."

ZES_remember_past:0 "Remember the Past..."
ZES_remember_past_desc:0 "Our nation was founded by desperate refugees on an alien shore, who transformed their situation from desperation to prosperity. We owe all to those who came before us, and we will always remember them."

ZES_for_future:0 "...For the Sake of the Future"
ZES_for_future_desc:0 "One day, our descendants will look back on what we accomplished, and their judgement will fall on us, as it falls on everycreature. If war comes to our lands, it is on all Kásans to remember what they are defending; the liberty and security of countless generations yet unborn."

ZES_educate_all:0 "Edukason Universal"
ZES_educate_all_desc:0 "If our nation shall advance, we must make sure even the least among us are given the skills and the education needed for the modern world. No matter where they live, no matter their background, and no matter their character, we must give them all proper education."

ZES_teach_democracy:0 "Democratic Values"
ZES_teach_democracy_desc:0 "Though Kása's doors stand open for all, this should not be confused for blind tolerance for every idea out there. It might be paradoxical, but in order for democracy to prosper, it must justify and educate the people about its existence and its demands, otherwise we give tyrants an open gate to use democracy to abolish it."

ZES_mandatory_and_free:0 "Supplementary Schools"
ZES_mandatory_and_free_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, there are those who do not fit into the education system. Thankfully, Yrmthu has proposed a solution for how to address this. Instead of beating them down and leaving them feeling worthless, we will create a system of supplementary schools with looser reins, where those who failed once can get a new chance on their own terms."

ZES_students_abroad:0 "Student Exchange Program"
ZES_students_abroad_desc:0 "As our education system grows, it is attracting more attention from abroad. Ambitious scientists and professors across Kása has already forged bonds with academies beyond our shores, and there are many who would accept our sons and daughters as students."

ZES_formal_education:0 "Enshrine Formal Education"
ZES_formal_education_desc:0 "Knowledge is power, and we are steadily working towards making Kása a scientific great power. In due time, Seguro can become an academic institution much like Yale, but in order for this to happen, we must be ready to dedicate ourselves to this pursuit."

ZES_build_faculty:0 "Build Modern Faculties"
ZES_build_faculty_desc:0 "Scientific progress is no longer a matter of singular geniuses, but an industrial effort that requires specialized tools, and we're not going to let our finest minds struggle without proper equipment."

ZES_latest_curriculum:0 "Currículo Mais Risentimenti"
ZES_latest_curriculum_desc:0 "Once, certain crafts were vital for Kása, but time has marched on and we must reevaluate what our students are taught. In the classroom, the children are prepared for modern society, and things like wickercrafting is not nearly as useful as it once was."

ZES_unified_spirit:0 "Espírito Unificado"
ZES_unified_spirit_desc:0 "From pre-schools to the highest universities, our education system is one entity. It is the first gentle hoof that molds our citizens to be able to thrive, and no matter where they are, there is a way forward for them."

ZES_practical_education:0 "Assess Practical Education"
ZES_practical_education_desc:0 "It is true that academic education is vital, but so is the more hooves-on type of knowledge. We shouldn't forget the value of the practical alongside the theoretical. A master engineer holds value equal to a genius professor, and the education should be held in equal regard. "

ZES_apprenticeship_program:0 "Apprenticeship Program"
ZES_apprenticeship_program_desc:0 "Most crafts are not learned in the school bench, but in the workshop and on the factory floor. For all those practically minded foals and chicks who languish in the classroom, there should be an easy and established way to let them come into their own right."

ZES_cooperate_with_business:0 "Kordena Com Nogosi"
ZES_cooperate_with_business_desc:0 "The private sector of Kása holds countless talented innovators and businesscreatures, and their experiences can help shaping our apprentices. This, in turn, will let the private sector benefit all of Kása more indirectly as well."

ZES_entrepreneurial_spirit:0 "Espírito Empreendedor"
ZES_entrepreneurial_spirit_desc:0 "We are not merely educating scientists, but ambitious entrepreneurs as well. The ivory tower intellectual has his place, but the innovator takes society forwards just as much."

ZES_shining_pearl:0 "The Shining Pearl"
ZES_shining_pearl_desc:0 "On the shores of southern Griffonia, Kása stands as a beacon of hope and prosperity for all, a place where none is left without a chance to fulfil their full potential. Since the days of Akeeku, we have known that prosperity is measured as how the weakest among us are doing, and in this regard, we have delivered!"

ZES_freedom_of_press:0 "Cherish the Free Press"
ZES_freedom_of_press_desc:0 "We will never allow ourselves to become so high and mighty that we cannot tolerate criticism. If the free media wishes to protest against the actions we take, that is their prerogative. Ours will be to listen."

ZES_discredit_tyranny:0 "Discredit Tyrannical Ideals"
ZES_discredit_tyranny_desc:0 "Democracy is not - must not - be two wolves and a sheep voting on who is for dinner, nor should it meekly accept challenges to its core values. Those who seek to undermine our democracy will be challenged to prove their reasoning, and through the virtue of Kása's achievements they will be found wanting."

ZES_codify_institutions:0 "Codifying our Institutions"
ZES_codify_institutions_desc:0 "Having tasted the power available to the First Commander, Lûa Ramedi finds himself hesitating. The power at his command is immense, and it will only grow. Though he would not presume to judge those who served before him, he simply cannot let virtue alone be what restrains him. Laws help society hold itself to a higher standard, and he should not be exempt."

ZES_mansuism:0 "Mansuism"
ZES_mansuism_desc:0 "Kása's Advisory Council is a fine institution, one that supposedly has the power to depose even the First Commander. It is time to do away with the gray areas and let it take up the burden of leadership. Lûa Ramedi is content to sit in it as first among equals, and the immense powers he hold can go back where it belongs: to the people."

ZES_welfare_to_poor:0 "Establish Welfare System"
ZES_welfare_to_poor_desc:0 "Kásans have always taken care of each other, and our government should be no different. Schooling, unemployment, old age, all these things can cause problems for the unfortunate, and we did not build Kása to these heights just to people can be left at the fickle whims of fortune."

ZES_open_doors:0 "Into Kása's embrace"
ZES_open_doors_desc:0 "Ho there wanderer, from distant shores/Whose journey brings you to our gate/We beg you, sit, we'll tend your sores/If you would tell us of your fate\nThe path behind you grows dark still/From whence you were forced to roam/But you can rest now, if you will/Come, let Kása be your new home."

ZES_bakaran_way:0 "The Bakaran Way"
ZES_bakaran_way_desc:0 "To our north, Bakara has a longstanding tradition of local democracy, and while recent events there have given reason to be mindful of the kinks in the system, the value of keeping democracy close to the constituents cannot be overstated."

ZES_define_democratic_process:0 "The Due Process of the Law"
ZES_define_democratic_process_desc:0 "Democratic Kása is a frail idea, and it needs to be firmly established by law and by culture both. This is not a temporary measure, nor is it at the First Commander's sufferance only. It shall stand strong and vibrant, unshaken by winds of populism or incompetence."

ZES_skapatoria_purpose:0 "Agents of Freedom"
ZES_skapatoria_purpose_desc:0 "The Skapatoria Programa is one of Kása's greatest assets, and its services will not be less vital in the future.

ZES_embassies:0 "Our Place in the World"
ZES_embassies_desc:0 "Kása is a small nation in a big world, and our best bet for survival is to rely on more than our army and our people, but on our friends as well. We are not alone in our desire for peace and harmony, and we should endeavor to find like-minded regimes out there."

ZES_republican_thought:0 "Philosophy of the Tricolour"
ZES_republican_thought_desc:0 "The issues facing Kása is not unique, and other species have found their own answers. The ideals of Alexander Kemerskai and the Griffonian republicans offer a solution to Lûa Ramedi's woes. Kása's First Commander and the Griffonian President are, in the end, similar institutions, and the First Commander should be bound like the president is meant to be."

ZES_protect_liberty:0 "In Defence of Liberty"
ZES_protect_liberty_desc:0 "Kása's army is not an instrument of suppression, but a tool of liberty. They fight to defend their fellow creatures, no matter what challenges arise, and internal threats are no different. If, the gods forbid, the institutions of law and order fail, the military has a sacred duty. If need be, they must step in to defend not power-hungry politicians, but the values of the nation."

ZES_prosperous_democracy:0 "Equal Prosperity"
ZES_prosperous_democracy_desc:0 "When a society is divided it becomes weakened. With the wealth that now is at Kása's disposal, it will behoove us to make sure that everyone can benefit from it. Whether born in a hovel or in a palace, all creatures should share what Kása has."

ZES_asterion_model:0 "Asterion Model"
ZES_asterion_model_desc:0 "Freedom isn't free, and the price can too often be paid in blood. Thus it was paid on the D'Vash, and thus it was paid by the Minotaurs of Asterion. We can learn from them, and make sure that we have the tools to safeguard our democracy by whatever means necessary."

ZES_council_republic:0 "Devolved Rule"
ZES_council_republic_desc:0 "The change has been monumental, but it was necessary. Lûa Ramedi held absolute power and his hooves, and he has let it go, giving it to the people who he holds responsibility for. They will be given the highest responsibility and become masters of their own fate."

ZES_presidential_republic:0 "Presidential Executive"
ZES_presidential_republic_desc:0 "The role of the president is to act as a leader in times or war and peace both, yet he holds this power in trust, and he rules as a symbol of unity and mutual respect. If he fails in his duty, he can and should be deposed. His role is clearly defined, leaving nothing to chance or interpretation, and in this clarity there is trust."

ZES_declare_republic:0 "Declarar a República"
ZES_declare_republic_desc:0 "Kása will never be the same again, and time will pass its judgement as it does with all things, yet Lûa Ramedi knows that this was the right thing to do. Kása's people deserve a voice, and Kása will be stronger for it. "

ZES_look_for_friends:0 "Look For Friends"
ZES_look_for_friends_desc:0 "The fact is that Kása is small and surrounded by large powers. Yet, we still have friends out there, friends who have known the pain of bondage and who would stand with us, if we made sure to play our cards right."

ZES_macawian_cooperation:0 "Old Friendship"
ZES_macawian_cooperation_desc:0 "Macawia is and will always remain Kása's dear friend. This bond shall not be broken easily, and as a show of good faith, Lûa Ramedi has negotiated for a grand military exercise, under which Macawia will act as the enemy, attempting to invade Kása. It is merely an exercise, but nevertheless Kása has grown enough that it can now stand firm even against its old patron."

ZES_liberation_ships:0 "Navios di Libertação"
ZES_liberation_ships_desc:0 "The seas are our domain as much as the land, and we shall contest it just as fiercely. The seas were where we gained our freedom, and if slavers, raiders or conquerors dare to approach our shores, they shall find the Kásan navy waiting for them. "

ZES_secured_foreign_policy:0 "Watch Out For Foes"
ZES_secured_foreign_policy_desc:0 "Tolerance is not naiveté, nor is a desire for peace mere weakness. Kása was born through fighting, and if need be she will do it again. She can defend herself, she wants to defend herself and she will defend herself." 

ZES_secure_borders:0 "Fronteiras Seguras"
ZES_secure_borders_desc:0 "From the very second that an invader sets hoof on our lands, he shall run headlong into our defenses, and not a single inch of Kása shall be surrendered to him without bitter fighting. We are not a superpower, but we can make the enemy spill enough blood that if we finally, the cost was not worth the prize."

ZES_defend_harmony:0 "For the Republic!"
ZES_defend_harmony_desc:0 "If war should come, it is every citizen's duty to defend the nation with every mean available. Every message saying that resistance should cease is a false one, and the only way that peace can be achieved is when the invaders are driven out."

ZES_foundations_of_modern_kasa:0 "Foundations of Modern Kása"
ZES_foundations_of_modern_kasa_desc:0 "From shacks huddling together on a stormy shore, to fledgling towns and villages, to a prosperous nation. Kása is rising, and the fruits of all our labours are growing each day. Yet as we harvest, the question is how we make the most of our blessings."

ZES_public_radio:0 "Radio Kása"
ZES_public_radio_desc:0 "Inspired by the recent development in telecommunications, Radio Kása can finally begin broadcasting. With radio masts set up across the nation, and with three dedicated channels - News, Music and Education respectively - the entire nation will be able to enjoy this newest of media."

ZES_continue_public_projects:0 "Continue Public Projects"
ZES_continue_public_projects_desc:0 "We have made splendid progress in these last years, and the Xatisa crisis is slowly approaching its end. The refugees that flee Barrad are greeted by a well organized relief effort, and they are taken down newly built roads towards the towns where help and hope both awaits. "

ZES_guarantee_employment:0 "Guarantee Employment"
ZES_guarantee_employment_desc:0 "Our successes are leading to new questions, not the least the one regarding what to make of the refugees long term. Adapting to a new society is tricky, and we will have to make sure that they - as well as those who already were here - have a genuine chance as long as they genuinely wish to work. It will cost, but our society will be stronger for it."

ZES_ministry_of_finance:0 "Ministério das Finanças"
ZES_ministry_of_finance_desc:0 "Macawia's financial aid has been invaluable, but the time has come for Kása to stand on its own four hooves. With greater control of our economy, we will be able to more effectively control our own fate."

ZES_international_port:0 "Expandir Portu di Ilha Rosca"
ZES_international_port_desc:0 "The success of the Ilha Rosca ports speaks for itself, but all projections suggest that they are over capacity. It is overall a pretty nice problem to have, or at least one that can be addressed with some effort."

ZES_fund_development:0 "Renewing Seguro"
ZES_fund_development_desc:0 "Seguro is one of the older cities in Kása, and time has caught up with it. With the recent progress made elsewhere, the time has come to truly regenerate the city. Voices have been raised about the preservation of some of the older buildings, and we shouldn't be hasty, but at the same time old thatched roof huts aren't quaint enough to outweigh proper new housing."

ZES_invite_the_world:0 "Invite the World To Us"
ZES_invite_the_world_desc:0 "Kása is not and should not be an isolationist state. The world is out there, and instead of casting it out, viewing it as morally inferior, we should embrace it. We will have to prevent certain excesses, true, but if they can behave, they can make us both prosper."

ZES_develope_outback:0 "All of Kása Should Live"
ZES_develope_outback_desc:0 "The cities of Kása will most likely prosper on their own, and that is not where our efforts should be spent. The nature of our economic system means some regions get left behind. We mustn't let that happen, and therefore we must actively work to make sure all of Kása can prosper." 

ZES_gift_land_act:0 "Ato di Propriedadi"
ZES_gift_land_act_desc:0 "Land ownership in Kása is highly unequal, with large swathes of land having been purchased by ambitious land speculators, who many times don't even use the land but seek to sell it at a premium. This state of affairs cannot be allowed to remain, and while we will set a generous lower limit, it is time to break this cycle and make sure that unused land can be claimed by those who would actually make use of it."

ZES_modern_roads:0 "Fyrport-Seguro Railway"
ZES_modern_roads_desc:0 "There is an opportunity to kill two slavers with one stone, the countryside unemployment is maybe not as visible as in the city, but it is still there. Offering these now available workers employment building a railroad from one end of Kása to the other will not only put money into the economy, but if done right it will teach them skills for the future. We also get a really nice railway out of it too!"

ZES_model_villages:0 "Model Villages"
ZES_model_villages_desc:0 "We should do away with the notion that certain region of Kása are 'frontier regions'. In the distinction lies a devaluation: after all the opposite of frontier is heartland. Not a single square meter of Kása is less important than the heartland. Kása is one, and all of Kása shall prosper together!"

ZES_focus_on_interior:0 "Our Urban Centers"
ZES_focus_on_interior_desc:0 "Kása's cities are the economic engine that drives the nation, and responsible economic policy dictates that we must spend our money in the most efficient way. Our goal is the prosperity of the entire nation, and for that, our cities must be allowed to be the workhorses they were meant to be."

ZES_electrify_land:0 "Utility Poles and Power Plants"
ZES_electrify_land_desc:0 "A Gryphussian advisor recently suggested that as Kása's electrical grid expands, the state should make sure that it was highly controlled through the use of both patents and legislation so that our grip on the power supply was absolute. He was subsequently laughed out of the meeting before an open, modular system that will allow us to easily switch out and access every bit of it was adopted."

ZES_free_apartments:0 "Futurus Aparmentus"
ZES_free_apartments_desc:0 "Electricity, running water, indoor plumbing, these are all things that modern apartments are expected to have, but are they? We should aim to introduce these modern comforts to every last apartment in Kása, no matter where they are."

ZES_model_cities:0 "Cidades Modelo Brilhante"
ZES_model_cities_desc:0 "These once small outposts, founded by exhausted refugees and nearly broken slaves, have grown to be shining beacons of civilization. Not a civilization built on exploitation and tyranny either, but radiant jewels of freedom and prosperity."

ZES_damn_fireshore:0 "Inaugurate the Akeeku Dam"
ZES_damn_fireshore_desc:0 "Building statues are an exercise in vanity, and Lûa Ramedi has from the beginning been committed to the idea that if the founder of Kása should be honored in any way, it should be through something practical, something that provides for the nation and stands as a testament to more than its leaders' vanity."

ZES_plan_regions:0 "Merging the Counties"

ZES_irrigation_canals_desc:0 "Rivers are the lifeblood of many nations, yet Kása has only one. What she has, however, are mountains streams which can be diverted towards the farmlands, and which can help water our crops much more efficiently."

ZES_resettle_refugees:0 "The Home Plan"
ZES_resettle_refugees_desc:0 "Currently, the refugees make their homes in the rural border regions in government-sponsored camps.

ZES_rethink_capitalism_desc:0 "Capitalism has gone through a lot of changes as an ideology over its history.

ZES_avoid_skyfall_desc:0 "Skyfall is the prime example of corrupted capitalism, a land of filthy oligarchs and demonic corporations.

ZES_increased_taxation:0 "Increase the Tax Rate"
ZES_increased_taxation_desc:0 "Pasarinha's reforms are ambitious, and ambition generally requires funds.

ZES_cement_council_support_desc:0 "There are many likeminded councillors that Pasarinha can court to achieve his goals, but many do not fully trust the businesszebra.

ZES_parlay_with_lua:0 "Parlay with Lûa"
ZES_parlay_with_lua_desc:0 "As Mansu Erba's protege, Lûa still holds an air of prestige and power within the council. Working with him would provide us more support for our more ambitious reforms, and grant our regime legitimacy as the successor to the Avo's."

ZES_denounce_extremism_desc:0 "Extremism has no place in Kása! We are a proud democracy, and nothing shall stop that! While Pasarinha is more of an economics zebra than one for politics, he recognizes the importance of denouncing extremism so that Kása maintains its course as a proud democracy."

ZES_abandon_gold_standard_desc:0 "The idea that gold and other precious materials have intrinsic value has held economics back for hundreds of years, it is now our job to take the final step to end this system.

ZES_chamber_of_commerce:0 "Câmara do Comércio"
ZES_chamber_of_commerce_desc:0 "Pasarinha may be an intelligent Zebra, but he can not do all his work alone. Establishing an advisory council of industrialists and wealthy Zebras of Kása will allow us to always have creatures to consult for economic advice.

ZES_look_to_workers_desc:0 "The labor issue has long been prevalent in Kása. The issue of the refugees and how to provide for them has lead to a strong labor movement across the nation.

ZES_modern_police:0 "Organise Metropolitan Constabulary"
ZES_modern_police_desc:0 "Many times when large cities arise throughout the world, crime grows and festers within them.

ZES_public_health_system:0 "Universal Healthcare"
ZES_public_health_system_desc:0 "City living is a new thing for many creatures. Working long days in new job markets leaves openings for disease to slither in.

ZES_macawia_garrison_treaty_desc:0 "Macawia often views Kása as its little cousin on the shores of Griffonia.

ZES_disband_monopolies:0 "Divide the Companies"
ZES_disband_monopolies_desc:0 "Many large corporations and monopolies held Gryphus in their claws.

ZES_thorough_land_study:0 "Fund Mineral Investigation"
ZES_thorough_land_study_desc:0 "While it is easy to simply give permits for new companies, a key problem remains untouched; much of Kása's mountains and hills remain unsurveyed.

ZES_license_steel_foundries_desc:0 "Recently a new coal vein has been discovered and already many companies have sent requests to the ministry to purchase the rights to extract it or be given permission for deeper surveys in the nearby areas.

ZES_industrial_production:0 "Secondary Sector"

ZES_airline_production_desc:0 "Aircrafts, for most part, still remain a military tool in the eyes of the population.

New regulations will be implemented to ensure that only good, quality products will be manuafactured in Kása."

ZES_car_production:0 "Mareland Automobile Innovation"
ZES_car_production_desc:0 "While automobles are widely known about, only the rich can really afford to import and maintain them. However, a new company seeks to change this matter; from New Mareland, the Sorraia seeks to move its entire production to Kása. They say the they simply cannot compete with its rivals.

ZES_services_sector:0 "Tertiary Sector"
ZES_services_sector_desc:0 "The third and final sector compromises all those companies who provide services to the population, such as stores and restaurants. While Pasarinha saw this mainly as the smallest sector of the three due to Kása's small population, a new idea from Bicoafi and Eala proposes an unorthodox addition to this sector — tourism."

ZES_renovate_castles:0 "Renovate the Castles"
ZES_renovate_castles_desc:0 "Ever since Sinóra's times, old castles have laid abandoned across Kása. Formerly seen as symbols of oppression, teams of archeologists, builders and representatives of the Ministry now travel across Kása to evaluate their current condition. Those that are found fit enough will be restored to act as hotels and other attractions for those seeking to live like the Wittenlandic nobles of the past. Even if only for a few days."

ZES_nature_reservations:0 "National Park Plan"
ZES_nature_reservations_desc:0 "For the longest time, the untamed wilderness in the northern areas was seen as a bleak landscape without any proper purpose. But in this untouched landscape also dwell many curious creatures and animals alongside a land not ruined by the modern world. Something that some mays wish to see and experience."

ZES_prepare_local_services:0 "Prepare Housing and Services"
ZES_prepare_local_services_desc:0 "In addition to providing attractions for the visitors to marvel at, they will need other services such as accommadations. The Ministry of Development has reserved a portion of money to fund the foundations of new hotels and the expansion of existing ones to cater to the need of tourists in addition to other minor ventures."

ZES_tourism:0 "Aberto a Birnís"
ZES_tourism_desc:0 "Only one step in our plan remains, as designed by Bicoafi: a massive advertisement campaign in Macawia and Griffonia about the wonders that Kása has. While the main focus will be upon rich visitors, part of the campaign will also be the affordability of trips designed for average working-class families. These budget holidays, carefully designed to be cost-effective, offer a chance for tourism at a scale not yet seen."

## Yrmthu route
ZES_yrmthu_elected:0 "Yrmthu's Vision"
ZES_yrmthu_elected_desc:0 "The Xatisa changed Kása and now, the new First Commander is the living proof of that change. Under her leadership, the Free State will attempt to reconcile with itself by renewing with the communal ideals of Akeeku, nay, with the First Village. Akeeku was but one among many great zebras."

ZES_talk_to_nation:0 "Public Speech"
ZES_talk_to_nation_desc:0 "Mansu Erba kept in touch with the nation by the way of radio broadcast. While no law forces her to do so, First Commander Yrmthu saw fit to continue this tradition and instill trust in the government. It shall be a first step towards opening a new dialogue in Kása."

ZES_enshrine_harmony:0 "Enshrine Harmony"
ZES_enshrine_harmony_desc:0 "As new interests in Kása become evermore entrenched, we must ensure that our idealistic foundation remains preserved. Kása is a land devoted to freedom and harmony of all beings. This seminal idea must be safeguarded against any threat, be they military, ideological or corporate."

ZES_macawian_friendship:0 "Amizadi Macawiana"
ZES_macawian_friendship_desc:0 "When she was elected, Yrmthu promised to turn her attention inwards, to the forgotten creatures of Kása. However, across the sea, we have a friend, one who is willing to help. And while we shouldn't be naive about them, we ought to cultivate this partnership."

ZES_send_agents:0 "Envie os Agentes"
ZES_send_agents_desc:0 "Creatures still reel under the hooves of their oppressors. In Barrad, in Austurland and Gryphus. It is time to initiate a surge of Skapatoria activity, to help those who can escape and to instill hope in those who cannot yet. Let us be passive no more!"

ZES_heal_society:0 "Heal Our Society"
ZES_heal_society_desc:0 "For all the patting on the back we give ourselves, the truth is that the Xatisa has scarred Kásan society. There remains distrust and grievances between the Barradian refugees and the Kásans. And not just among them. We need to remind ourselves that we are all, in the end, Kásans. By inheritance, choice or circumstances. We will stand together."

ZES_ban_left:0 "Denounce Marksist-Stallionism"
ZES_ban_left_desc:0 "The Marksist-Stallionist say they wish for a revolution to free every working creature on earth but we have quite a few Prywhenian refugees with tales of exactly how they go about it. Kása is a land in which citizens freed themselves and shall continue to do so. The black, red and green banner of hope will always be preferable to the bloody red."

ZES_ban_right:0 "Antivenom to Nationalism"
ZES_ban_right_desc:0 "Nationalists do like their fantastic tales of immanent nations transcending the ages to become homogenous nation-states. But the D'vah and Ilha Roca told another tale. Kása is no land of fantasy. It is a land for anyone who adheres to the ideal of freedom, cooperation and the pursuit of happiness. It is a land for the weary, for you and for me."

ZES_rip_bandage:0 "Rip the Bandage"
ZES_rip_bandage_desc:0 "Our prisons are full of those who were caught supporting the Pentarchy or the deer slavers as well as less than savory Kásans. For a long time, we saw these creatures as abnormals, put away from society and forgotten. However, we ought to confront them and allow for a peaceful path back to society. Yrmthu wants Kása's dirty laundry exposed rather than hidden."

ZES_unified_in_harmony:0 "Magiku di Amizadi"
ZES_unified_in_harmony_desc:0 "What is the meaning of Kása? Most will say it is freedom. Some even scream it to the skies. But what is freedom if the poor and rural has less say than the rich and urban? What is the freedom in begging? We need more than freedom. We need friendship. A home is built on more than freedom alone after all."

ZES_fight_illiteracy:0 "Light of Knowledge"
ZES_fight_illiteracy_desc:0 "The Livru Programa produced a lot of progress in the fight against illiteracy but much remains to be done. Efforts will be continued to increase literacy amongst the population. More funds will be diverted to the travelling schools and to the development of higher education faculties in Seguro."

ZES_in_every_village:0 "In Every Township"
ZES_in_every_village_desc:0 "The fundamental error in dealing with the Xatisa was to stuff them all in the camps around Oferclif, overloading the city. But our nation is a land of small villages and towns. We shall unite them in a mutual cooperation to house and feed the refugees. It will be a perfect pilot experiment for something grander."

ZES_seek_lua_support:0 "Appease the Establishment"
ZES_seek_lua_support_desc:0 "While Yrmthu had the popular support, many veteran councillors had supported Lûa Ramedi's campaign and he had the ears of many skeptics among the Kásan elite. To avoid any conflict with them, let us invite the zebra to join her in building a better Kása."

ZES_devolve_council_power:0 "Empower Direct Democracy"
ZES_devolve_council_power_desc:0 "The griffons and the river ponies complain endlessly about mob rule but there is wisdom in the community. Not the masses as the communists argue but in the local collectives. There will be the rock on which we build the future. It is time to devolve power back to the towns and villages where it first came from, right after we emerged from the damp decks of the D'vash."

ZES_what_is_state:0 "O que é Stádu?"
ZES_what_is_state_desc:0 "Power has been given back to who it rightfully belongs to and yet, democracy is a culture. One we will have to learn once more after decades of centralised management. There will be mistakes and there will be ridicule but in the end, the towns will learn again and from that experience, true communities will emerge. Kása will be itself once more."

ZES_power_of_friendship:0 "Poder di Amizadi"
ZES_power_of_friendship_desc:0 "We gathered help from every level of Kása: the charities, the villages, the elites. But those efforts were still timid, disjointed. It's time to gather them all and coordinate and bring relief to the refugees. Together we'll end the Xatisa! As friends. As Kásans."

ZES_deconstruct_authority_complex:0 "Deconstruct Authority Complex"
ZES_deconstruct_authority_complex_desc:0 "Kása has been blessed by great leaders. Akeeku. Sínora. Mansu Erba. But this has been a curse in disguise. More and more, we moved away from the ideals of the First Village, giving ever more importance to the First Commander. We've beholden ourselves to an imperial leadership, a monarchy on a throne of dried reeds. This ends now."

ZES_devolved_power:0 "The Position of the Council"
ZES_devolved_power_desc:0 "Through the powers of the First Commander, much could be done to empower the communities of Kása but even its authority has limits, thank the spirits. For months, the Council has grumbled about the devolution of power. It is time to face them down and set the course for the future."

ZES_talk_to_experts:0 "Meet with Experts"
ZES_talk_to_experts_desc:0 "Democracy is a wonderful form of government. Yet, to succeed, the public and their servants need to be informed. And in the face of the Xatisa, we need new perspectives. For this purpose Yrmthu will call upon the learned to aid her in this endeavor."

ZES_wealth_taxation:0 "From Deep Pockets"
ZES_wealth_taxation_desc:0 "The First Village was founded on an ideal of equality and cooperation. Yet, inequality of wealth has become a reality in Kása, to the point that key individuals together have more than the government itself. Given how the government is struggling, it is time that those who enriched themselves thanks to our ideals give back to the community."

ZES_public_works_program:0 "Initiate Public Works Program"
ZES_public_works_program_desc:0 "Infrastructure of Kása is underdeveloped, especially in the mainland. Many towns are connected only by dirt paths. Yrmthu had the chance to experience it herself during the electoral convoy. Our people deserve better, and for this sake the government will invest in building paved roads and railroads to connect the townships."

ZES_refugee_charity_programs:0 "Collective Charity Efforts"
ZES_refugee_charity_programs_desc:0 "The state alone can only do so much to deal with the Xatisa. Yrmthu has seen its effect firsthoof. So, we need to swallow our pride and turn to those who would give willingly. Let's coordinate the charity efforts and give some relief to the refugees camps at Oferclif-Retorno."

ZES_new_local_factories:0 "Support Local Production"
ZES_new_local_factories_desc:0 "One would be hard pressed to enjoy industry. It is loud, dirty and oppressive. Yet, to ignore their use only means we will be at the mercy of the Macawian exports and the dreaded Gryps-Süd GmbH. We need to truly kickstart a local production and expand our native factories which remain in their infancy."

ZES_urban_growth:0 "Fresh Urban Development"
ZES_urban_growth_desc:0 "For too long, we have relied on the wealthy and the Macawian foreign investors to develop our town, leading only to squalor and runaway rent. To free our people from the clutches of immoral landlords, we need to invest in those cities and make sure that every citizen can live in dignity."

ZES_encourage_village_life:0 "Aid the Remote Towns"
ZES_encourage_village_life_desc:0 "For too long we have hoped that the plucky settlers of Kása would make a life for themselves by themselves in the mountains and remote plains of the country. The truth is that there is hardship that rugged individualism can only do so much to overcome. It is time to end the myth and give them aid."

ZES_strenghten_communities:0 "Local Communities"
ZES_strenghten_communities_desc:0 "For all the optimism of Kása, we can still feel it. Behind every corner lurks the sinister shadow of where Kásans came from. Slavery. The centralized state tried to heal that wound through care and proper leadership but it wasn't enough. Responsibility must be in the communities' hooves so that they can finally realize that free, they indeed are. And freedom is a never ending work."

ZES_local_not_global:0 "Local não Global"
ZES_local_not_global_desc:0 "Macawian help has been a boon for Kása but it came with strings attached. It tied us to the spirit of unfettered free trade and globalisation. But what place can we find in our world when we have so little and yet are forced to pay others rather than our neighbours? Let us restrict exports for now. It was too soon for us."

ZES_secure_food:0 "Kumida Baratu"
ZES_secure_food_desc:0 "The Pact of 907 was a wonderful thing but as we revise our obligations, so too must we be sincere friends and not expect the Macawians to provide for us. Self-reliance is our responsibility for our own benefit but also to our overseas friend. In time, we shall be able to support our sister republic like it supported us once. This is the spirit of growing, not that of hateful autarky."

ZES_wealth_of_community:0 "Riqueza di Comunidade"
ZES_wealth_of_community_desc:0 "As the communities grow their own foods and the industry produces our own products, we have been able to free up much capital that would have in the past gone to buying foodstuff and material on the international market. Now, it's time to invest that money into our future. With wealth comes the ability to invest and that we shall do."

ZES_to_north:0 "Vá Para o Norte"
ZES_to_north_desc:0 "Barrad. The word itself leave nocreature indifferent. There is a sickness in those mountains, lying in every castle stone, in every depraved corridor and in the heart of all those who serve the Pentarchy. No longer can Kása live in the shadow of the mountain. So let's go north and not come back until this is all over. There can be no hesitation in facing down madness."

ZES_emergency_aid:0 "Emergency Aid to the Townships"
ZES_emergency_aid_desc:0 "The Pentarchy never cared for the population, ruling over them as tyrants and leaving them naught but dirt to live off. And now the war has disrupted what little the populace had of food supply. They need emergency relief at all cost. We must not allow another Xatisa to occur!"

ZES_secure_mountain_holds:0 "Secure the Castles"
ZES_secure_mountain_holds_desc:0 "Many old fortifications lay scattered across the land, which were build by Wittenlandic nobles. Now, they remain as ruins of the old regime. They must be secured, so not bandits or dark mages may occupy them for any nefarious cause."

ZES_congress_opens:0 "O Congresso di Seguro"
ZES_congress_opens_desc:0 "Much has changed in Kása ever since Yrmthu was elected as First Commander. The energetic pony has now called upon a congress, where she, the Advisory Council and representatives from the local assemblies will convene to discuss matters of state and the tasks ahead."

ZES_organise_local_schools:0 "Support Local Schools"
ZES_organise_local_schools_desc:0 "Many communities have already formed their own educational facilities for the young and curious. But many others lack the resources. To alleviate the situation, Yrmthu will encourage and coordinate these smaller communities to pool their resources together for mutual benefit."

ZES_law_on_draft:0 "Decentralized Mobilization"
ZES_law_on_draft_desc:0 "It is vital that the state is defended and modern wars require vast forces. For this reason, Yrmthu will cooperate with the local assemblies to not only organise mobilisation but to also create local training units under local authorities."

ZES_redraw_assemblies:0 "Accurate and Fair Borders"
ZES_redraw_assemblies_desc:0 "The ancient councillor election borders used by the local assemblies are vastly outdated, with former small villages either nearly abandoned while former townships have turned into vast cities. To create a more accurate representation, a commission will be created to re-organise the political borders."

ZES_guild_of_charity:0 "Guild of Charity"
ZES_guild_of_charity_desc:0 "A group representing the many charities have appealed to the congress with an interesting proposition; to allow them to organise themselves into a guild focused to the cause of aiding the poor. This has been met with wholehearted approval by the whole congress."

ZES_matter_of_coin:0 "About Coins and Economy"
ZES_matter_of_coin_desc:0 "A curious problem has arisen across Kása; as the economy has become decentralized, so too has money. Various communities have adopted their own coins, usable only in local markets. This is, however, causing issues in nation-wide commerce and fears of counterfeiting. To protect the economy, a central bank will be created with the sole power to mint money."

ZES_final_congress_decree:0 "The Closing Topic"
ZES_final_congress_decree_desc:0 "As the congress reaches its end, the First Commander takes her spot by the podium for one final discussion; one over the essence and spirit of Kása."

ZES_austurland_resolution:0 "Look to Austurland"
ZES_austurland_resolution_desc:0 "The deer vikingar have always stood as a direct threat to Kása and as a bastion of slavery in eastern Griffonia. In order to secure the confederation's existence and further our cause, an eternal peace must be forged one way or another."

ZES_abandon_longships:0 "Abandonar as Naves"
ZES_abandon_longships_desc:0 "The age of raiding must come to an end. Instead, the former vikingar will be guided to live their lives in peace and friendship with their neighbours."

ZES_forgive_them:0 "Perdoe Eles"
ZES_forgive_them_desc:0 "Thralldom was a cruel institution propped by greed and willful blindness. However, vengeance is not the answer. Instead, Yrmthu will attempt to promote peace between the victims and those who supported the slavery in the name of universal friendship."

ZES_limited_coordination:0 "Limited Coordination"
ZES_limited_coordination_desc:0 "To empower each and every Kásan is our goal but we ought to ensure that coordination and cooperation remain possible, for the benefit of all. After all, not all regions are equal and we ought to make the best use of our common wealth so that the least blessed by geography can still thrive. Though the pill may be a bit hard to swallow to the most privileged local councils."

ZES_ensure_trade_routes:0 "Expand the Railways"
ZES_ensure_trade_routes_desc:0 "Travelling across Kása has always been a pain. Yrmthu could experience it firsthoof even when she was running for First Commander and conflict hasn't helped since. It is time to remedy this in collaboration with all communities in Kása. Who doesn't like trains anyway? Choo choo!"

ZES_seek_out_resources:0 "Wealth of the Land"
ZES_seek_out_resources_desc:0 "Kása has always been a rich land but there has always been a reluctance to exploit it. With little know-how and capital, we would have had to rely on Macawia or private investors to exploit it, with all that entails. But now, we can finally get started and be sure that all and any profit will go to the community rather than to pay for some rich magnat's oil painting."

ZES_found_foundries:0 "Construir Fundições"
ZES_found_foundries_desc:0 "As iron, coal and oil are coming out of Kása's soil, new opportunities are emerging for a war industry. We shouldn't rely on foreign purchases to equip those who would defend us. Our ancestors in Zebrica were master metallurgist after all. It's time to bring that back, with our own little twist on the old recipe!"

ZES_national_mining_industry:0 "Setor Nasional di Mineração"
ZES_national_mining_industry_desc:0 "As we have opened extraction operation, there has been a renewed interest in surveying the land. Previous mining projects that would have been unprofitable are now being put back on the table as we gather more and more equipment and personal. Let's invest in those so that all in Kása may reap the rewards of such hard work!"

ZES_mutual_industrial_development:0 "Merge Industrial Developments"
ZES_mutual_industrial_development_desc:0 "Small local communities can never support vast industrial development alone. It would, instead, be better if these assemblies would plan together for mutual benefit. There will be plenty of difficulties ahead but it is important that we don't fall back to cottage industries when we could do so much more and benefit together."

ZES_electrification:0 "Power-Up the Communities"
ZES_electrification_desc:0 "Electrification has been a long and old issue in Kása, ever since the industrial revolution swept through Griffonia. We were able to power most of our biggest cities, with priority to Seguro. But now, we have the means to do more. We can no longer accept to see the day end with the setting sun. A functioning lightbulb in every home is no longer too much to ask."

ZES_standard_education_scheme:0 "Assembly of Education"
ZES_standard_education_scheme_desc:0 "Education, by its very nature, is a from-the-top institution. While 2+2 equalling 4 does not change from village to village, there is still a vital need for local input into education. Let us set up an Assembly depending on the Council with representatives from all over to discuss education in a way that can help all trust our school system better."

ZES_local_needs:0 "Local Education Schemes"
ZES_local_needs_desc:0 "Instituting an oversight body to inspect our communities would be a crime against their natural rights. It is far better if they are allowed to develop and manage their own education needs without the central authority getting involved, and to better suit their local needs. Who better to decide how to teach the youth than their own parents and communities?"

ZES_ink_act:0 "Tinta e Kaneta"
ZES_ink_act_desc:0 "In the modern age, it is as vital to know how to read than it is to walk or knowing which end of the shovel digs. We ought to finally crush illiteracy by requiring every resident of Kása to be able to read or write and mandate those who can't to follow a course to remedy the problem. Both at the confederal and local level, all are in agreements on this."

ZES_mansu_diploma_program:0 "Concessão do Diploma di Mansu Erba"
ZES_mansu_diploma_program_desc:0 "Despite our great advances in education, many Kásans still can't follow superior education. Perhaps it is time to institute a program of grants distributed to various communities to remove the funding burden. And who better to name it after than our late Avo?"

ZES_liberalized_economy:0 "Local Economies"
ZES_liberalized_economy_desc:0 "Despite pushback from Seguro politicians, we will move forward with our plan to liberalize and decentralize economic oversight. If the communities have no say in such matters, we may as well not bother with our confederal vision. And after all, the Ilhas Lagostas thrived thanks not to centralization but to cooperation and local wisdom."

ZES_organize_farmers_markets:0 "Support Farmers' Markets"
ZES_organize_farmers_markets_desc:0 "Many Kásans are still farmers or artisans and yet, they are forced to rely on intermediaries or sell to exporters and have a hard time competing with stores and imports. Let's ease the legal and financial burden resting on local markets so that anyone producing crops or other products may profit from them without having to pay someone else to sell them when they can."

ZES_give_out_the_land:0 "Gift Unused Land"
ZES_give_out_the_land_desc:0 "With the crisis in Barrad finally over, a great deal of land previously too dangerous to be safely settled remained unused or emptied themselves as creatures would move to the safer coast. Now, it's time to put them to good use, by making sure that so many Kásans can now start their own communities, on their own terms. To do this in another way would betray our history."

ZES_farming_mechanisation:0 "Modern Agricultural Machinery"
ZES_farming_mechanisation_desc:0 "Farming techniques remain extremely simple and are very often obsolete. It is no wonder after all since many had to make do with little capital to acquire or means to make modern equipment. But now, as our situation improved and we no longer need to dedicate so much funding to the Xatisa relief or the Barrad border, we can help all communities to get their hooves on modern equipment."

ZES_luxury_spices:0 "The Rare Herbs"
ZES_luxury_spices_desc:0 "As local markets began to open up, some gourmet creatures began to notice that rural families had been cultivating a great many deals of forgotten or rare herbs. Many such plants were brought from abroad by refugees and carefully adapted to the local climate. In a way, we've just found out that Kásans succeeded on their own in doing what would have cost millions to do with professional botanists."

ZES_global_drink:0 "Bebida Kenti Global"
ZES_global_drink_desc:0 "The recent spice boom has opened up so many opportunities, especially in producing the "Bebida Kenti" herbal blend for infusions and flavoured drinks. Perhaps we have a shot at making bank on this and profiting from a new export for the benefit of all communities rather than through some private corporation. And to think, it could have all remained little and forgotten herbs gardens."

ZES_diversify_economy:0 "Diversificar a Economia"
ZES_diversify_economy_desc:0 "The confederal reforms brought about an agrarian boom in Kása but agriculture is tricky and our lands are too rough to make a future out of it. We ought to adapt for the modern age and prepare for the future by investing the farmer's product in new industrial community projects so that our economy can diversify. It's a farmer's wisdom to not put all of our eggs in the same basket after all!"

ZES_modern_confederation:0 "Foundations of Our Modern Confederation"
ZES_modern_confederation_desc:0 "The Congress of Seguro laid out the road ahead and we walked through it proudly, doing our best to avoid any potholes. But now, it's time to codify it all and finally"

ZES_tour_the_land:0 "Tour The Land"
ZES_tour_the_land_desc:0 "As the Confederal reforms are rolling out, it is not time to sit back and enjoy the Seguro sun. Rather, it's the perfect time to celebrate and tour Kása to meet everypony. Maybe we'll even hear a little bit of feedback here and there!"

ZES_meet_ambassador:0 "Meeting with the Macawians"
ZES_meet_ambassador_desc:0 "Much has happened in just a few years. From a tiny nation on the verge of disaster and bankruptcy to a thriving emerging small power. And credit goes to where credit is due, our sister republic across the sea has helped. Let us meet with them to thank them and to reintroduce them to their little sister. All grown up as we are, they might not recognize us!"

ZES_dissolve_borders:0 "Dissolution of National Borders"
ZES_dissolve_borders_desc:0 "Kása is the land of the free. For all of our history, we've welcomed all. Slaves, exiles, refugees. We've been met with invaders, vikingars, pirates and disasters. And yet, we stood. It is time to abolish border enforcement altogether so ideals and law are final in accordance. All are welcome! And for those who would threaten us: better than you have tried and failed."

ZES_second_congress:0 "The Second Congress of Seguro"
ZES_second_congress_desc:0 "Reports have come in from all over Kása about disagreements between communities and even instances of violence. We need to address those matter immediately or everything that Yrmthu and all who believed in her message worked so hard to achieve will have been for nothing. If Kása is divided against itself, it won't stand for long. "

ZES_regulations_on_magic:0 "Regulations on the Practise of Magic"
ZES_regulations_on_magic_desc:0 "Many recent incidents have been caused by a visceral fear of magic users, often accused of being sympathizers of the defunct Pentarchy. But this is no paranoia, Yrmthu herself saw firsthoof the dangers of magic. We ought to establish a confederal set of regulations to prevent any problem and create a license system to responsibilize each and every magic users."

ZES_hogwarts:0 "Horsford School of Spellcraft and Alchemy"
ZES_hogwarts_desc:0 "As the magic regulations were being rolled out, Yrmthu pondered a great deal on how to make them work and endure on the long-term. This lead her to design a new project, one of a mandatory school dedicated to educating magic users in the proper way of practicing it and administrating the handing out of magic licences. Such a place would likely be special and complex to manage. But Kása is full of able creatures."

ZES_national_negotiations:0 "Elevate Council Negotiations"
ZES_national_negotiations_desc:0 "As we empowered local communities, we cannot just let them struggle on their own. Rather, we ought to figure out a new common social contract, not one directed from the top but stemming from the grassroots. In the end, we are all in this together, just like the slaves of the D'vah once were. The confederal government must be able to offer its help and advice and help instill a spirit of cooperation. If one fails, we all do."

ZES_enforce_cooperation_laws:0 "Reminder About Friendship"
ZES_enforce_cooperation_laws_desc:0 "To heal the rifts of Xatisa-era Kása, we promoted a spirit of friendship to all but as we overcame the rifts left behind by our Avo, we lost sight of this. We need to better enforce confederal regulations and mandates on communities to cooperate. We are a confederation united in friendship, not a collection of egocentric castle owners."

ZES_greater_good:0 "O Bem Maior"
ZES_greater_good_desc:0 "As the Second Congress finishes its work, it is time for First Commander Yrmthu to address it in a closing speech. There are great expectations after so many accused her of doing nothing and shifting blame to others. But she'll rise to the occasion. For to lead is not to project eternal and constant strength but to take responsibility. It is about the common good and there is only shame in not correcting a mistake."

ZES_visit_family:0 "Family Visit"
ZES_visit_family_desc:0 "As the dust finally begin to settle on the reinvigorated confederation, the First Commander's agenda begins to clear itself too. And so, perhaps it is time to once more get out of Seguro. But what ought a simple mare to do except to finally get on the train and visit the family? Back to where it all began. In Retorno."

ZES_collective_identity:0 "Many Identities Under One Banner"
ZES_collective_identity_desc:0 "When one thinks of Kása, one is quick to picture a zebra but we are so much more than that. We are creatures of all stripes and we stand for an ideal, not for some imported zebrican national spirit. We do not demand assimilation or class loyalty, for to be Kásan is to simply be yourself, in free community and solidarity with your neighbours."

ZES_shared_struggle:0 "Our Shared Struggle"
ZES_shared_struggle_desc:0 "Kása has always been defined by a struggle for its future. The details of such the struggle may differ depending on the time and situation but its spirit remains the same in every case. Together, united in our beloved diversity, we will fight for the freedom of all, no matter creed or class. Let a Kásan flag flying in the wind instill fear in tyrants and slavers but not in the heart of innocent neighbours."

ZES_skapatoria_reformation:0 "Modern Skapatoria Programa"
ZES_skapatoria_reformation_desc:0 "As the threat on Kása's borders is slowly waning, some have begun to worry about the Skapatoria Programa and its power. Some call it a secret police in waiting but these warnings are but alarmist calls and the well-respected agents are in to save lives, not ruin them. Many dangerous elements still lurk in the shadows. It is vital that the agency is equipped to deal with anything seeking to harm the confederation."

ZES_electronics_development:0 "Eletrônica Moderna"
ZES_electronics_development_desc:0 "There was a time when the ability to track hoof steps and listen in to conversations were among the greatest skills of a Skapatoria agent. Recent developments in electronics have opened new avenues for protecting our information and uncovering what the tyrants wishes to hide. Kása must not lag behind on this field if it wishes to remain safe."

ZES_kasan_volunteer_legion:0 "Legião Akeeku"
ZES_kasan_volunteer_legion_desc:0 "Recent reports have alarmed Yrmthu; wherever she looks, harmony and democracy are threatened by tyrants. The Pentarchy might have collapsed but the struggle moves on! Those who stand for harmony must not be left alone! Kása will stand, side by side, with its harmonic brethren and Akeeku's Legion will be there to defend freedom."

## Áltu Kexa route

ZES_altu_kexa_elected_desc:0 "Áltu Kexa, the famous poetess, has taken office. Passionate, militant and an idealist, she believes the ends justify the means — and that all will be liberated, no matter the cost. It is time for the tyrants of the world to learn what it means to be afraid."

ZES_persuade_council:0 "Persuade the Astray"
ZES_persuade_council_desc:0 "A large majority of the advisory council is made up of older more experienced politicians. While their wisdom is useful, it seems they have lost the plot. If Áltu is to proceed with her plans, she will need support however. They need to know how and why she was voted in... And that it's her way or the Highway."

ZES_talk_to_rich:0 "Discussões de Champanhe"
ZES_talk_to_rich_desc:0 "The wealthy have the means to achieve much but can rarely be bothered to do so. Forcing them will do naught but cause them to leave or to oppose us. Instead, let us remind them about our past struggles and their families' origins. That will convince them to aid us. And should anything else, we can always butter them up."

ZES_issue_bonds:0 "Issue Defence Bonds"
ZES_issue_bonds_desc:0 "Even the most just wars need money. However, it would be unwise to indebt ourselves to foreign capital. Rather, some national bonds should help to both rouse the populace and provide a less dangerous source of income. Our people will surely arise to this task for the sake of common good."

ZES_public_private_cooperation:0 "Private In Service of the Public"
ZES_public_private_cooperation_desc:0 "Thanks to the generous donations from the affluent, we should be able to invest and develop our budding industrial sector. It's a slow process and one that might benefit the burgeoning Kásan elite but it'll be worth it."

ZES_purchase_rifles:0 "Deals With the Merchants of Death"
ZES_purchase_rifles_desc:0 "Simple passion is not enough. Our people need weapons and we cannot await for the industry to catch up. Instead, we will look out to the world and buy what we lack. Even if it means meeting with the lowest creatures of this world. They will get their comeuppance eventually but for now, we have bigger fish to fry."

ZES_train_refugees:0 "Treinar Para a Luta"
ZES_train_refugees_desc:0 "Put the word out! Any refugee who wishes to return home are encouraged to enlist. We'll make sure the former serfs are trained and able to take back their homes from the oppressors!"

ZES_contact_barrad_civilians:0 "To The Innocent in Barrad"
ZES_contact_barrad_civilians_desc:0 "Those who couldn't escape Barrad are stuck under the oppressive regime! Contact those who remained, and tell them we are coming. And that nobody will stand in the way of our righteous justice! Let hope blossom in the blighted mountains!"

ZES_macawian_support:0 "Suporte Macawia"
ZES_macawian_support_desc:0 "Barrad is burning and the ponies of the mountains who could flee the rule of the Pentarchy are pouring in Kása. Yet for years, Macawia stood on the roadside while the Xatisa hurts all of us. Let us appeal to them, to their love of freedom and democracy. They will surely aid us, for our struggle is shared and just!"

ZES_our_cause:0 "Nós Causa"
ZES_our_cause_desc:0 "Kása's cause is that of freedom. From the day we stepped off of the D'vah to the beaches of Ilha Roscas, it was our duty and destiny to lead the fight for freedom. For too long we have played second fiddle to Macawia. No more. Barrad will be our opening act, our warning to the world, our time to shine at last. We will earn the right to carry the banner of freedom by ourselves!"

ZES_old_liberator:0 "The Old Liberator"
ZES_old_liberator_desc:0 "Áltu isn't a soldier, this much is known. She is a passionate poetess and a simple zebra. But there is someone else. One who embodies the ideal of radical abolitionism and the struggle for freedom. A griffon veteran of wars gone by and robbed of his homeland, and she could use his help."

ZES_monument_to_be_fallen:0 "Monument of To-Be Fallen"
ZES_monument_to_be_fallen_desc:0 "There is but one certainly when it comes to war; people will die and we wish to honor them. Let us erect a monument in preparation for those who will sacrifice themselves in the name of liberty."

ZES_ignore_council:0 "Ignore the Naive"
ZES_ignore_council_desc:0 "These older politicians are a spineless and pathetic lot. Áltu does not have the precious commodity of time to tend to their ridiculous needs. We have a war to plan, people to liberate! She will not offer them her attention."

ZES_forced_loans:0 "Make Them Loan"
ZES_forced_loans_desc:0 "The hard truth is that the government needs money. For this sake, Áltu will declare that everyone in Kása must do their part for the common good. It'll pay off in the end."

ZES_stick_and_carrot:0 "Sinóra e Pó"
ZES_stick_and_carrot_desc:0 "Áltu proclaims an ultimatum to the decadent and debaucherous rich; cooperate or else! We are trying to do good, and them thinking they can just sit around thinking it'll all be fine is a ridiculous notion. They too must do their part and such is the price we ask for allowing them to claim more than their fair share!"

ZES_nationalize_industry:0 "Nationalise Crucial Industries"
ZES_nationalize_industry_desc:0 "Hard measures must be taken to secure military production for the liberation. Áltu will nationalise vital industries and make them adopt streamlined and modern industrial structures to produce military equipment."

ZES_conscript_refugees:0 "Liberte Seu Barrad"
ZES_conscript_refugees_desc:0 "Spread the word in the camps of Oferclif for we are going back to Barrad with cannons in tow! Arm the refugees! They too will fight to take back their homes and, with their help, we will overrun Barrad and make the enemy pay!"

ZES_gather_old_weapons:0 "Dust Off the Old Arms"
ZES_gather_old_weapons_desc:0 "We simply lack the weapons to equip our forces. For this sake, Áltu will call upon the population to donate their old firearms, ones given to them by the state centuries ago or privately acquired ones. What good is to pepper off the vermin when war rages on?"

ZES_prepare_for_war:0 "Heed Me, Tyrants of Barrad"
ZES_prepare_for_war_desc:0 "O Barrad. O tyrants. For many years, you have plundered and oppressed, ruined a region and sent their people to die on the roads. We hope you cherished these years and enjoyed your robbed wealth for those you oppressed are walking back home. Now comes the time to pay. Now comes your due: the loveliest of nooses."

ZES_noblest_cause:0 "Na Causa Sagrada di Liberdade"
ZES_noblest_cause_desc:0 "All the preparations are finally done and the time has come to liberate Barrad. Now all must do their part and arise to the task ahead for it is what Kása stands for! Fear our wrath, fear our just anger! The liberation comes."

ZES_cleanse_monsters:0 "No Quarter for Beasts"
ZES_cleanse_monsters_desc:0 "Under the Pentarchy, wild beasts roamed the land, growing stronger as the black magic of the Wretched Five corrupted and twisted them. We will send our best to fight them and clean the lands of Barrad."

ZES_establish_havens:0 "Shelters From the Storms"
ZES_establish_havens_desc:0 "Despite the castles of the Wretched Five burning, Barrad still has to endure the unnatural storms caused by their insane experiments. Alas, we won't be able to solve this in a day. We will dig in and build strategic bunkers and shelters for the people to hide in when storm hits."

ZES_hang_them:0 "Clean-Cut Affair"
ZES_hang_them_desc:0 "The five rulers of the Pentarchy are gone but it is wrong to blame them for all their crimes for a regime is more than just their rulers. There were sergeants enforcing their laws, administrators robbing the peasants of their crops while they starve and worse. We have their names and they too shall face justice for what they did in Barrad."

ZES_barrad_comission:0 "Comissão Barrad"
ZES_barrad_comission_desc:0 "A commission will be established to oversee Barrad's affairs as well as the reconstruction, resettlement and cleansing of the land. It will be a long time before that land may see light once more but we Kásans do not fear hard work in the name of freedom."

ZES_fortress_of_freedom:0 "Fortress of Freedom"
ZES_fortress_of_freedom_desc:0 "Barrad is free but its liberation did not come without its cost. To overstretch ourselves now might give ideas to neighbouring powers. Kása must now secure its existence, so that its freedom will not be squashed and any tyrant will be thrown back."

ZES_talk_to_economists:0 "Talk to the Economists"
ZES_talk_to_economists_desc:0 "Kása's economy lays in state of limbo since the conflict. Already weak well before Áltu even took office, Kása will need far-reaching reforms if it is to avoid financial collapse and a possible Macawian bailout. We can't allow that to happen. Perhaps it is time to meet with these economists who prefered Ramedi or Pasarinha and sway them."

ZES_limit_big_business:0 "Anti-Monopoly Measures"
ZES_limit_big_business_desc:0 "The concentration of wealth is a scourge on the land and the root of tyranny. Yet we can already see the seeds of such entrenchment of the elites in our beloved Kása. Decrees and edicts will be placed to limit size of private companies so they cannot become too powerful or rich who are mostly non-local."

ZES_support_local:0 "Aid the Small Artisans"
ZES_support_local_desc:0 "For a long time, Kása has had issues competing with cheap foreign import, especially the Macawian goods and the smuggled Gryps-Süd GmbH merchandise. We will give small business funds and state protection so that they are not threatened by international markets."

ZES_economic_protectionism:0 "Léi di Proteção"
ZES_economic_protectionism_desc:0 "The state can only do so much to help a just economy flourish if cheaper foreign goods are just next to ours on the stores' shelves. To help make up the gap, new tariffs and quotas for imports will be put in place to protect local economy."

ZES_right_of_work:0 "Right of Work"
ZES_right_of_work_desc:0 "Unemployment is an abhorrent societal disease that must be eliminated. We will provide employment for all, either in special community project, local government, non-combatant military logistics or state-sponsored private industry. Nopony shall be locked in poverty."

ZES_lifetime_education:0 "Prendison Perpétu"
ZES_lifetime_education_desc:0 "Education should not end after school nor should older creatures be afraid of learning. One only has to look at Áltu's husband for example. One ought to learn for their entire lifetime and new institutions and educational groups across the land will strive to share this passion with all."

ZES_no_riches_or_rags:0 "No Rags or Riches"
ZES_no_riches_or_rags_desc:0 "Throughout history, creaturekind has been obsessed with the accumulation of wealth, even more so in Griffonia where the bigots believe griffons are born to do so. Yet, it is a meaningless goal, unable to bring happiness. True love and the absence of misery are the only true wealth. Such is our ethos."

ZES_plots_for_refugees:0 "Lands for the Landless"
ZES_plots_for_refugees_desc:0 "Kása, despite being small, still has plenty of land to share. We will gift this land to those in need, so that they make use of it and rebuild their lives for good. For what point is there in holding on to plains and forests while the common creature wastes away in the streets or the tents of Oferclif."

ZES_mansu_livru_legacy:0 "To Fulfill A Dream"
ZES_mansu_livru_legacy_desc:0 "Mansu Erba wished to eradicate illiteracy from Kása. It was a worthwhile desire though the Xatisa prevented her from dedicating enough resource to truly end this terrible situation. We will finish her job today."

ZES_ideal_life:0 "Ideal Life"
ZES_ideal_life_desc:0 "The greatest mistake in modernity is to try and sell the ideal of city life as the new norm. Yet, cities often come with squalor and overcrowding when the simple life in the countryside brings so much more. Kása should strive to allow for everyone to be whom they wish to be and one should be able to afford the ruran bliss."

ZES_happiness_in_simplicity:0 "Felisidadi na Simplicidade"
ZES_happiness_in_simplicity_desc:0 "Happiness is what life must strive for and Kása stands to help everycreature find it without excess. There is no need for sprawling forest of bricks and concrete nor for palaces adorned with golden leaves. There is joy in simplicity and we Kásans understand that."

ZES_free_intellectual_pursuit:0 "Common Knowledge and Wisdom"
ZES_free_intellectual_pursuit_desc:0 "Ignorance is a disease that none should suffer from. Even if we pursue a simple life, that does not mean we are simple-minded. Rather, freed from both wanton materialistic greed and misery, we are free to pursue higher ideals and goals such as high learning."

ZES_need_for_defence:0 "Weapons for Defence"
ZES_need_for_defence_desc:0 "Kása's freedom is an ideal that must be upheld against the tyrants. For its sake we must forge weapons to fight back any who threatens us."

ZES_eulogy_for_dead:0 "Eulogy for the Dead"
ZES_eulogy_for_dead_desc:0 "The Barrad Liberation left both soldiers and civilians dead. And with the monument to the fallen completed, it is time to bury those we have lost in these hallowed grounds. We must honour them and also those who perished under the cruel tyranny of the Pentarchy."

ZES_remind_of_duty:0 "Relenbra di Divere"
ZES_remind_of_duty_desc:0 "Even in peace, Kása must never forget its responsibility. There are some who see us fail, who see us in chains again and who would burn Ilha Roscas to the ground. We must remain vigilant lest all our sacrifices will have been for nothing. Everyone must be ready to do their part in defending our freedom."

ZES_plan_cells:0 "Plan Resistance Cells"
ZES_plan_cells_desc:0 "As terrible as the idea is, there may be a day when the Sun-spangled Flag won't fly over our cities, when oppressors would rule us again. And should this happen, we must prepare the resistance so that hope can remain. We will form secret groups of local civilians trained to fight a guerilla war against any enemy force with weapons cache and secret paths. If we are denied peace, we will make our oppressors' life unbearable."

ZES_defence_plans:0 "Sinóra Line"
ZES_defence_plans_desc:0 "It is unfeasible for us to defend our entire land. For this sake, we will fortify our core areas upon the island and peninsula, creating an impenetrable line of bunkers and trenches from where we can bounce back when the enemy's guard is down."

ZES_armed_society:0 "Sociedade Armada"
ZES_armed_society_desc:0 "Limiting access to weapons does us no good. If we cannot trust our citizens, then how can we expect them to trust us? Arms should be common part of our daily life as any other tool is. And should war come to us, there will be a rifle behind every blade of grass to meet whoever would be foolish enough to come."

ZES_peace_guardians:0 "Guardians of Peace"
ZES_peace_guardians_desc:0 "It would be a waste to simply demobilize willing and able veterans. Therefore Áltu has decreed the formation of a new security force to ensure rapid deployment against any perceived threats in and out of Kása. They shall be the pillar on which we will build our defense."

ZES_declare_neutrality:0 "Sozinhu"
ZES_declare_neutrality_desc:0 "Kása has no imperialistic visions and has no desire to be entangled in unjust wars. For this sake, we declare ourselves neutral from any foreign politics. We won't make the same mistakes as the righteous ones in Bakara, Ponaidhean or the River Republic fooled by the promises of the Coltstream Treaty. We are a free and sovereign nation."

ZES_aid_the_small:0 "Ambassadors of Peace"
ZES_aid_the_small_desc:0 "Even if we prefer peace, this does not mean we must stand isolated and alone in this world. How can we inspire others to follow in our hoofsteps if we refuse to talk to them? Kása will extend her hoof to those who too stand for harmony so we can plant the seeds of freedom like Macawia did with us."

ZES_safeguarding_democracy:0 "Our Democracy"
ZES_safeguarding_democracy_desc:0 "Kása's democracy must remain sacrosanct and the foundation of our nation. To ensure this much and finally appease those who feared that Áltu would become a tyrant, she has declared that First Commander's position will from here on be an annually elected position instead one set for a lifetime."

ZES_fund_defence_agency:0 "Agência do Fundo"
ZES_fund_defence_agency_desc:0 "It is important we know what our foes may plan. For this purpose, we will expand the Skapatoria Programa to be a fully fledged intelligence agency. We need eyes in every capitals and in every places where slaves still have to utter those most horrid of words: "Thank you, master.""

ZES_austurland_plan:0 "Planu Austurland"
ZES_austurland_plan_desc:0 "For too long, Austurland has acted as a bane on our existence. Not content to oppress their own, the deers of the east raided our coast, enslaving or maiming innocent creatures for naught but greed and bloodlust. We will deal with them and free the thralls!"

ZES_break_estates:0 "Break the Estates"
ZES_break_estates_desc:0 "Land and wealth in Austurland has long been concentrated in large estates worked by thralls and owned by the nobility. We will break them apart, distribute land to the freed thralls and use the financial assets to pay reparation and fund the pacification of the deer lands. Finally, there is justice for generations of slaves."

ZES_shatter_wicked_traditions:0 "Talk to the Berserkers"
ZES_shatter_wicked_traditions_desc:0 "In a strange twist of fate, we have discovered the existence of a sect in Austurland called the Berserkers, dedicated to the cause of aiding all. Perhaps, we could enlist their services?"

ZES_investigate_land:0 "Map the Land"
ZES_investigate_land_desc:0 "For all their greed, the jarls of Austurland were rather mediocre when it came to economics. From all accounts, there is a wealth of resources in these lands that have gone unexploited. We shall send experts to evaluate them. It is time we put those resources to good use and use the profit to help repair the damages of thralldom."

ZES_vanguard_of_liberation:0 "Vanguard of Liberation"
ZES_vanguard_of_liberation_desc:0 "Barrad was but the stepping stone for our grand war of liberation. In the North and in the West, there are still wanton oppression and Kása must not remain put. It must do its part to make the world a better place, to ensure that all creatures can live in freedom. Such is our duty and burden."

ZES_industrial_duty:0 "Industrial Revolution"
ZES_industrial_duty_desc:0 "War has changed since the days when it was enough to gather plucky adventurers to stand against overwhelming odds. Now, war is industrial and it is not only soldiers who fight. Workers, too, are at the forefront of modern war and we will ensure that they know well their part in the struggle."

ZES_liberation_curriculum:0 "To Learn of Liberty"
ZES_liberation_curriculum_desc:0 "Education is a right for all and the key to beating back ignorance. But part of the education should also teach us to love freedom and understand why it is important to us. For what else than a lover of freedom could an educated creature be?"

ZES_freedom_poetry:0 "Poziâ Pa Heróis"
ZES_freedom_poetry_desc:0 "Áltu is known for her love of poetry and recently she has composed a new one to commemorate those that have fallen in the cause of liberty. This has encapsulated the public to remember the fallen and pick up their cause."

ZES_worker_soldiers:0 "Worker-Soldiers"
ZES_worker_soldiers_desc:0 "Strange events have taken place across Kása; workers in the factories have formed impromptu workers battalions and began fire practise together on their free time. Áltu has praised their initiative, giving governmental support for it despite fears of some owners."

ZES_white_book:0 "Branku Livru"
ZES_white_book_desc:0 "A new poem collection has recently been published by Áltu, focusing on an issue she feels strongly about, that of neutrality. For a creature can not be neutral in the struggle between the oppressor and the freedom fighter. Taking no side means you are complacent in the suffering of the serf and slave."

ZES_militant_harmony:0 "Our Life for Others"
ZES_militant_harmony_desc:0 "Kása has seen great changes under the rule of Áltu Kexa. She has shown to Kása that harmony is simply not something to be enjoyed but also something dear. Now, it stands ready to follow her order to liberate those beyond our borders so they too can live free."

ZES_decry_the_dragons:0 "Disgrasa os Drágas"
ZES_decry_the_dragons_desc:0 "What point is there in extreme wealth? When a creature owns more than an entire city, what do they provide? How many houses do they build, what roads do they maintain and what electricity do they produce? Nothing. Instead, they hoard away their gold like dragons, parading about in their golden halls. Shame on them."

ZES_kinder_capitalism:0 "Kinder Capitalism"
ZES_kinder_capitalism_desc:0 "Slanderous rumours claim that Áltu Kexa is a communist who wants to get rid the wealthy in the name of marksist-stallionism. This is simply not true; she merely wishes them to be saved from decadent greediness and instead make the world a better place with their wealth."

ZES_redefine_wealth:0 "Redefinir a Riqueza"
ZES_redefine_wealth_desc:0 "Wealth can be so much more than just material goods. It can be a tool to help many escape poverty and free themselves from material constraints and the struggle for survival. Such freedom is the condition of a true pursuit of happiness rather than simply the unending quest to acquire more.. Áltu will encourage such thought across the nation."

ZES_happy_utopia:0 "A Better Society"
ZES_happy_utopia_desc:0 "A bright future lays ahead in the horizon, where competition and rivalry have been replaced with cooperation and friendship. There may still be hurdles on our path forward but we now know how to fight them off in a true Kásan spirit. If Akeeku could see what we have achieved, nocreature would dare say he wouldn't approve."

ZES_form_cooperatives:0 "Form Co-Operatives"
ZES_form_cooperatives_desc:0 "For too long, we have left the organization of labor to the wealthy, in perhaps the worst inspiration we took from the Macawians. Nearly gone is the spirit of cooperation of those who stepped out of the D'vah. We will dictate that all large businesses will need to transform into cooperatives where their ownership is shared between the owners and the workers."

ZES_consumer_development:0 "Ngábar a Indústria di Consumo"
ZES_consumer_development_desc:0 "Kása now has gathered the means to fund new ventures and invest. But we ought to be careful as to not lose ourselves in our quest for liberation. We will invest in the civilian economy for the war against tyranny is meaningless if we do not care for our own citizens like the conquerors of old."

ZES_military_development:0 "Ngábar a Indústria di Militar"
ZES_military_development_desc:0 "The war of liberation requires bullets and in this modern age, we cannot afford to be on the losing side of industrial warfare. Our government will encourage military-industrial complexes in the Asterionese fashion. It may be uninspiring but freedom requires a price to be paid in coal and steel. Only defeat can be paid with blood alone."

ZES_national_university:0 "Universidade di Nasional"
ZES_national_university_desc:0 "Liberation is a fight that also needs to be fought on the intellectual level. Our military and cooperatives both need new methods and ideas while it is paramount to teach Kásans how to free themselves in their daily lives. We will build a new university in Seguro and offer grants to gifted citizens to come and study there."

ZES_talk_to_workers:0 "Fale Com os Trabadjadóres"
ZES_talk_to_workers_desc:0 "For a long time, Kása has remained somewhat timid in its dealings with labour unions. Yet, it is a perfect form of citizen empowerment against greedy elites and a worthy form of association. Our government will approach the various unions to secure their support and cooperation and provide help where it can."

ZES_encourage_intellectualism:0 "Encourage Intellectualism"
ZES_encourage_intellectualism_desc:0 "Kása has always been held back by a strange focus on physical labour as the sole meaning of work. Though some is due to our difficult conditions, it is also the scar left by colthaginian slavery. If we are to truly free ourselves, we need to free our own minds and not be humble in the face of intellectual pursuit."

ZES_new_worker:0 "Nóbu Trabadjadór"
ZES_new_worker_desc:0 "Labour and toil. The daily pursuit of a slave. Even in freedom, we have been forced to endlessly toil to build by ourselves what was denied to us. And after that, capitalism and industrialization brought new forms of hardship. But not anymore. As union membership soars and both wages and working conditions improves, the meaning of labour is changing."

ZES_expand_batallions:0 "Expand the Worker Battalions"
ZES_expand_batallions_desc:0 "Workers surprised us by arming themselves and forming their own militias. It has proven to be a very fruitful partnership between them and the Free State. With a foundation proven to be so sturdy, we ought to expand on it and provide them with more resources to expand and professionalize their military training."

ZES_tyranny_gryphus:0 "The Western Company"
ZES_tyranny_gryphus_desc:0 "West of Kása lies Gryphus. Home of some of our most wretched enemies and stolen home of our brothers and sisters in arms, the Gryphussians. Since the early days of our life in Griffonia, we have had to beat back the assaults of the knights of Opinicus in war and those of the Gryps-Süd GmbH in peace. This ends now."

ZES_protect_native_culture:0 "Protect the Native Culture"
ZES_protect_native_culture_desc:0 "Since the Griffonian Empire subjugated the eastern side of the Evi Valley, the knights of Opinicus and the Gryps-Süd GmbH fought hard to force new cultures and practices on the natives. The local Gryphus culture will be protected by a new law and the displaced griffons will be given their ancestral lands back."

ZES_break_company_and_knights:0 "Riaportu Trial"
ZES_break_company_and_knights_desc:0 "The Free Town of Gryphus. Few names in Griffonia were as meaningless as this one. Through greed and bigotry, the knights and merchants enslaved a whole people in all but name. Public inquiry will see them and those who helped carry out their orders put to justice."

ZES_gru_core:0 "Bountiful Estuary"
ZES_gru_core_desc:0 "With the beginning of degriffonianization and the trials, we have righted many wrongs that plagued Gryphus but there is more to do, much more. The twisted form of colonial government of the region impoverished a place that by all accounts is fertile and full of potential. It is time to bring"

ZES_tyranny_wittenland:0 "The Northern Kingdom"
ZES_tyranny_wittenland_desc:0 "Wittenland. The Unicorn kingdom. Our ancestors united with many remnants of the old High Kingdom, abandoned to pirates, vikingars and griffon knights by their overlords. Queen White Star did try to stir it away from its old ways but her rule is over. With this last glimmer of Wittenlandic hope gone, it is time to strike and to finally write the last verse of the Wittenlandic saga. Down with the High Kings!"

ZES_liberated_society:0 "Break the Old Society"
ZES_liberated_society_desc:0 "Feudalism and aristocracy, such euphemisms for slavery and oppression. Throughout its history and despite their newfound clothes, Wittenlandic society was mired with them. Let us abolish all titles, all privileges and servitude. Let's burn the old law books and redistribute the wealth and land. Until it is done, there will be no peace."

ZES_equal_magic:0 "Mage-Liberators"
ZES_equal_magic_desc:0 "The mages of Wittenland have caused much harm to their own countryponies and to us. Whether they served the old regime of compromised themselves with the Barradian Pentarchy. Though, not all of them. With the help of the stalwart mage, Obsidian Shine, we shall reorganise those worthy mages into proper armed forces or integrate them within society without privileges nor nepotism."

ZES_refugee_administrators:0 "Reunited Families"
ZES_refugee_administrators_desc:0 "Barrad committed many crimes and it is easy to lose sight of what it caused to many Wittenlandic ponies, breaking families apart. Now that we all stand under one banner, let us get to work to reunite families, heal the pain of the Xatisa and forge strong and lasting bonds between the liberated people and their diaspora."

ZES_wit_core:0 "Enchanting Peaks"
ZES_wit_core_desc:0 "Freed from decayed traditions, serfdom and the ills of magocracy, Wittenland feels reborn. No longer do these lands toil for the benefits of some, only because they were lucky enough to be born with a horn and a silver spoon in their mouth. There is magic again amongst the peaks of the Wittenlandic mountains. The magic of friendship."

ZES_tyranny_nimbusia:0 "The Eastern Warriors"
ZES_tyranny_nimbusia_desc:0 "Nimbusia. The martial democracy. Was there ever a lie so blatant written in a history book? Is it enough to kill one bloodthirsty emperor to be absolved of morality and slavery? The Nimbusians say yes but we do not buy such lie. We fought off worse with less. If there is any martial democracy in the world, we ought to claim that title. We fight for good. Not for its own sake."

ZES_break_hoplites:0 "Disperse the Cyclone"
ZES_break_hoplites_desc:0 "The Nimbusian martial tradition came at the cost of gruesome and immoral selection. No wonder that after being faced with such abuse, they keep perpetuating such a criminal regime. The Trial of the Cyclone will be disbanded."

ZES_wine_hills:0 "Rebuild the Wineries"
ZES_wine_hills_desc:0 "Nimbusia was a land of wineries and farm estates. Yet, their crops and drinks had a bitter taste to those few who worked the land with no rights. With the helots freed, it is only fair that the reconstruction and land redistribution benefits them of all ponies. Soon, all of Kása shall be able to drink Nimbusian vintages without any worries about the ethics of its production."

ZES_nim_core:0 "Verdant Hills"
ZES_nim_core_desc:0 "Up north, on the coast of Nimbusia, one of the oldest power in eastern Griffonia enforced a grim idea, that of democracy and freedom being a privilege reserved to those who endured and perpetrated a brutal form of militarism. But truth always triumphs, even against the oldest lies. Now, the people sings again in Nimbusia for they can enjoy true freedom and true democracy."

ZES_free_world:0 "Mundu Livri"
ZES_free_world_desc:0 "Just a century ago, it felt as if the world was forced to live under the yoke of the Griffonian Emperor, with oppression and servitude as the orders of the day. So certain was the march of history. But things can change. History can be readjusted. The future shall belong to the downtrodden, the poor. Kása shall be a beacon to all who strive to make this world to all who fight against the wicked."

###Army (new tree)###
ZES_military_macavia_1:0 "Shipments Across The Sea"
ZES_military_macavia_1_desc:0 "Kása's military has always been reliant on Macawian aid, and the harpies have always been willing to give us what we need. In a world growing more dangerous by the day, we should appeal once again for aid."

ZES_military_macavia_2:0 "Deals with Macawian Arms Industries"
ZES_military_macavia_2_desc:0 "There's many arms manufacturers in Macawia, and some of them have expressed interest in opening up industries in Kása. They are amenable to the idea of putting these factories at Kása's disposal as well, and all they need is our signature."

ZES_military_macavia_3:0 "Heavy Arms Purchases"
ZES_military_macavia_3_desc:0 "Merely rifles will not suffice nowadays, and if we are to keep defending ourselves effectively, we must acquire the weapons of modern warfare."

ZES_military_own_1:0 "Fund Military-Industrial Complex"
ZES_military_own_1_desc:0 "Macawia's aid has been a blessing, but we have long since outgrown the need to fully rely on their backing. While our industry is fledgling, we nevertheless need to reorient ourselves towards becoming self-sufficient. One day Macawia might not be there for us, after all. "

ZES_military_own_2:0 "Invest In New Armories"
ZES_military_own_2_desc:0 "If we are to take charge of our own fate, we must expand our armories far beyond their current state. If we think long term, and make sure to keep expanding, Kása may well be truly self-sufficient in the end."

ZES_military_own_3:0 "Improved Production Methods"
ZES_military_own_3_desc:0 "We cannot be satisfied with "adequate" when it comes to our military equipment. A missing hammer can delay a building project, but a missing cannon can change the course of a battle. Streamlining our production methods will be imperative if we hope to be able to equip our army ourselves."

ZES_our_gun:0 "Projektu Bóka Bedju"
ZES_our_gun_desc:0 "Kása is not Macawia, and the weapons that are right for the latter need not be right for the former. As we grow as a nation, we should be developing weapons fit for Kása, with all that that entails."

ZES_military_GBP_1:0 "Organise The Defence Force Of Kása"
ZES_military_GBP_1_desc:0 "Kása's military has one purpose only, to make sure that whoever comes to our lands to do us harm is contested every inch of the way, and that if - gods forbid - Kása should fall the price will be high enough to not be worth it."

ZES_military_GBP_2:0 "Trench Fortifications"
ZES_military_GBP_2_desc:0 "As our enemies come, they shall meet a spiderweb of trenches, pill-boxes and foxholes, with tunnels criss-crossing the earth beneath the hills and forests and with defensive line after defensive line blocking their path."

ZES_military_GBP_3:0 "Improved Frontline Communications"
ZES_military_GBP_3_desc:0 "Without reconnaissance and communications we are blind, and we need to make sure that even if our enemies are the ones attacking, we are the ones who seize the initiative."

ZES_military_GBP_4:0 "Keep The Pace With Others"
ZES_military_GBP_4_desc:0 "We won't survive if we fall behind in the global arms race. New weapons can make the difference between subjugation and freedom, and we need to make sure to develop the best weapons possible for our soldiers."

ZES_military_GBP_5:0 "Kriansas di Pá"
ZES_military_GBP_5_desc:0 "When awaiting orders, dig. When setting up camp, dig. When on the defensive, dig. The shovel is a weapon as much as the gun, and if our soldiers are as well trained in its use, they will be all the better prepared for the challenges that await."

ZES_military_SF_1:0 "Proclaim The Army Of Kása"
ZES_military_SF_1_desc:0 "As Akeeku did when he took up arms against the slavers, Kása stands ready to go to war is that is what it takes to preserve her values and to contest tyrants. We will not meekly sit and wait for them to attack, not if we can strike first and with overwhelming force."

ZES_military_SF_2:0 "Advanced Training In Ballistics"
ZES_military_SF_2_desc:0 "The cannon has become a more and more vital part of modern warfare. If we make sure our soldiers truly master it, we will be able to punch above our weight class. It is a departure from Kása's traditional methods of fighting, but it is the way of the future."

ZES_military_SF_3:0 "Observer-Artillery Communication"
ZES_military_SF_3_desc:0 "If our artillery is to strike true, we must make sure that our observers and our batteries can stay in constant contact. Laying down telephone wires on a battlefield is an art in and of itself, and one that deserves to be taken seriously."

ZES_military_SF_4:0 "Only The Finest Equipment"
ZES_military_SF_4_desc:0 "As we unleash Tartarus upon our enemies, we must do so with the finest possible weapons. For all their size and noise, artillery guns are precision instruments as much as sledgehammers, and second-rate won't be acceptable."

ZES_military_SF_5:0 "Kriansas di Arma di Fogu"
ZES_military_SF_5_desc:0 "The cannon is more than just a weapon. Like Akeeku's spear symbolizes the determination to be free, the cannon will symbolise Kása's strength. We make the very skies ring with the thunderous roar of artillery, unleashing the rage and hatred of hundreds of years of suffering on all who would dare to bring fetters to our people again."

ZES_military_coop_1:0 "Expand Macawian Military Cooperation"
ZES_military_coop_1_desc:0 "We need to take an active role in our cooperation with Macawia, aiming towards becoming equals instead of merely students. Over time, Macawia will be able to learn from us as well."

ZES_military_coop_2:0 "Invite Macawian Officers"
ZES_military_coop_2_desc:0 "Macawia's officers have much to teach us, and their experience can be leveraged for Kása's benefit. Inviting a cadre of Macawian officers over to act as the enemy commanders of a great invasion of Kása will help us to shore up the nation's defences all the more."

ZES_military_coop_3:0 "Send Our Officers Abroad"
ZES_military_coop_3_desc:0 "The Macawian military academy has offered to take on our most promising officers, creating a stable exchange program that would let us combine our own experiences with theirs, improving our offensive capabilities."

ZES_military_coop_4:0 "Grandi Fórsa"
ZES_military_coop_4_desc:0 "When Akeeku rose and fought, there was no place for those who wanted to stay back. Everyone fought, or everyone would fall. This fundamental truth has not changed since then. If war comes all of Kása fights, or all of Kása falls."

ZES_military_coop_5:0 "Advanced Training Methods"
ZES_military_coop_5_desc:0 "Kása has grown, and we are now numerous enough that we can afford excellence. Superior training and equipment can make each Kásan soldier fight for two, and the grim mathematics of war demands that each fallen soldier must have done as much as possible."

ZES_military_coop_6:0 "Commanders At The Frontline"
ZES_military_coop_6_desc:0 "It has been suggested that instead of keeping our commanders far from the frontline, we should keep them right at it. Every second of delay can be deadly, and if our commanders are right among their soldiers, they will be able to organize them all the better."

ZES_military_coop_7:0 "Reserve Battalions"
ZES_military_coop_7_desc:0 "Single battles rarely decide the outcome of a war, and we need to keep this in mind. Keeping reserves at high alert at all times will allow us to respond to any sudden changes on the battlefield, denying defeat wherever it draws near."

ZES_military_coop_legion:0 "Expand The Ramui di Stranjerus"
ZES_military_coop_legion_desc:0 "The Foreign Legion has served Kása well, and though we are developing our own armed forces more and more, the Legion is still there and still appreciated for their contributions to our security. The time has come to expand them, making them fit for the modern era."

ZES_military_1:0 "Universidade di Difese Nasional"
ZES_military_1_desc:0 "War is a complex business, where equipment and zeal can only take you so far. We have to treat war as just as much a matter of scholarly research as any topic, and make sure to study its every facet. Thankfully, Field Marshal Lobu has already drafted up a proposal for this, and all that is needed is the First Commander's signature." 

ZES_military_2:0 "Formalise Hill Warfare Doctrine"
ZES_military_2_desc:0 "Kása's terrain shielded us from the very beginning, with the hills giving us plenty of places to slip away when the tide turned against us and to suddenly appear when we saw a moment. In some places, this knowledge has become a matter of family legacies and honored traditions, and we should make sure to unify these doctrines. "

ZES_military_3:0 "Formalise Mobilisation Procedures"
ZES_military_3_desc:0 "If war comes, we must rally our forces fast. Kása is too small for us to have much time, and by the time the enemy crosses the mountains, it can already be too late. Our nation must be like a coiled steel spring, ready to be unleashed at a moment's notice, otherwise we may not get a second chance."

##Army Áltu Kexa

ZES_altu_mili_1:0 "Preparing the Armed Forces"
ZES_altu_mili_1_desc:0 "The war of liberation requires soldiers, material and tactical superiority. For now, our militias can only do so much and we continue to rely on Macawian support through the Ramui di Stranjerus. It is time for a buildup!"

ZES_altu_mili_4:0 "Refine Our Doctrine"
ZES_altu_mili_4_desc:0 "Irregular warfare and impromptu tactical genius from commanders like the famed Sinora brought us to victory but was has changed. In this era of industrial warfare, we will have to find new ways to triumph with our limited resources. Innovation will be key."

ZES_altu_mili_5:0 "Great Reorganization"
ZES_altu_mili_5_desc:0 "To transition from old and inadequate system will take great efforts. However, it will also be the occasion to let the many ideas cooking up in the minds of our soldiers and citizens finally see the light of day. Let us call for officer meetings."

ZES_altu_mili_6:0 "Proclaim Kása Guarda di Nasional"
ZES_altu_mili_6_desc:0 "The time has come! Our military reforms have concluded and a new Kásan army shall rise from the ashes! Come now followers of the liberation, let us put to the torch all oppressors of the world! Kása é nossa!"

ZES_altu_mili_7:0 "Universidade di Difese Nasional"
ZES_altu_mili_7_desc:0 "Now that the Kásan army is up to the specifications of Áltu, we can establish a new school to teach our military doctrine to all aspiring new officers and recruits. So that all may be highly educated in the ways of liberation... and military tactics of course."

ZES_altu_mili_1_1:0 "Hold Together the Current System"
ZES_altu_mili_1_1_desc:0 "The current network of militias in the Kásan army is unfit to fight the liberations that Áltu has planned. But, we can put in effort to ensure that they are up to snuff for the coming conflicts. Otherwise, we will have to disband them."

ZES_altu_mili_1_2:0 "Call Upon More Local Militias"
ZES_altu_mili_1_2_desc:0 "The military buildup is a long process and we need troops now. Let us mobilize a greater number of our local militias. We will have to hope that the local councils can cope with this burden while we continue to prepare a more sustainable system."

ZES_altu_mili_1_3:0 "Kásan Citizens, Macawian Training"
ZES_altu_mili_1_3_desc:0 "We need professional troops and we need them now. Let us offer a deal to the Macawians. We shall send Kásans to go through the Ramui di Stranjerus training regimen and pay for the difference. This way, we will free up infrastructure and equipment for training that we could better use elsewhere."

ZES_altu_mili_1_4:0 "Establish Act No. 46"
ZES_altu_mili_1_4_desc:0 "The militia system proved to be a great way to be able to muster forces in a hurry. However, the system still has many flaws like the haphazard quality of troops and training. We will draft Act number 46 to institute a reserve corps for the Guarda di nasional. This way, we will combine the benefits of our professional force and the militias without racking up military spending."

ZES_altu_mili_2_1:0 "The Great Rearmament"
ZES_altu_mili_2_1_desc:0 "The Asterionese innovated in the alliance between the private military sector and the military with civilian oversight. It may be a productive venue to secure more weapons and ammunitions for our war effort. There also many other ways we can gather equipment without directly and massively expanding our industrial sector with all the costs associated with it. Let's study all of them."

ZES_altu_mili_2_2:0 "Fund Military-Industrial Complex"
ZES_altu_mili_2_2_desc:0 "To heavily invest in military industry will require to set aside a large part of our military budget. It will take time and effort to secure funding and still maintain some form of budgetary balance. However, it will be worth it in the end. Let's set up a commission to study the matter!"

ZES_altu_mili_2_3:0 "Deals with Macawian Arms Industries"
ZES_altu_mili_2_3_desc:0 "Macawia, our old partner, has a thriving industrial sector, one that could quickly and reliably provide us with military equipment. It may have the added benefit of endearing the Macawian private sector to our cause despite our economic and political agenda."

ZES_altu_mili_2_4:0 "Help From Our Friends"
ZES_altu_mili_2_4_desc:0 "Our war of liberation is more than a just cause, though we may think that it's all that matters. We can make the case to friendly powers that our fight will benefit them in many ways and in the case of Macawia, reduce our reliance on their economic and military aid and so relieve their budget. Now if only, they had a quick and non-committal way to help us..."

ZES_altu_mili_3_1:0 "Macawian Military Cooperation"
ZES_altu_mili_3_1_desc:0 "Ever since First Commander Kexa took office, many in the administration pestered her about increasing military cooperation as a great way to facilitate her foreign policy agenda. Chief among them was the diplomat Silera Meru. Perhaps it is time to hear them out, even if the spirit of Áltu's military plans are about reducing reliance on Macawia."

ZES_altu_mili_3_2:0 "The Spirit of Defense!"
ZES_altu_mili_3_2_desc:0 "The Macawians are quite vocal about their desire to help further the cause of liberation throughout the world. Yet, they get queasy about the risk of escalation in eastern Griffonia. We will display our commitment and efforts to build up Kása as an impregnable fortress to secure more funding and help."

ZES_altu_mili_3_3:0 "The Spirit of Liberation!"
ZES_altu_mili_3_3_desc:0 "The Macawians love nothing more than the ability to say that they contribute to world liberation. While we know they mean well, they can be a bit superficial in how some of them treat it as a hobby. We will sway them by showcasing the most glamourous and heartwarming aspects of our cause to secure more funding and help."

ZES_altu_mili_3_4:0 "Ramui di Stranjerus"
ZES_altu_mili_3_4_desc:0 "For a long time, the Ramui di Stranjerus has been the backbone of our military. It can still have a place among the Guarda di Nasional even if its role will be one of support rather than that of a spearhead. After all, many exiles are willing to come and fight under our banner. We will just need to nudge control away from São Penário and to Seguro."

ZES_altu_mili_4_1:0 "New Officer Core"
ZES_altu_mili_4_1_desc:0 "Our military staff is many thing: dedicated, loyal and upstanding. What it is less is professional or large. We need new leaders to command our expanding army. Soldiers fit for a professional army force rather than militia leaders and foreign adventurers."

ZES_altu_mili_4_2:0 "Instill Discipline in the Ranks"
ZES_altu_mili_4_2_desc:0 "The militias, for all their motivation and heart, were still an unruly bunch, more apt for irregular warfare than modern and symmetrical war. Sadly, most of our recruits still come from old militia volunteers. We ought to review our training regimen and make sure that they learn discipline and a certain esprit de corps."

ZES_altu_mili_4_3:0 "Copy Some Ideas"
ZES_altu_mili_4_3_desc:0 "We do not need to build all of our military doctrine from the ground up when so many nations in Griffonia and beyond honed the art of war for years and decades. Fortunately, we have some agents that are rather good at extracting things from hostile nations. The Skapatoria agents will just need to bring back ideas rather than refugees for once."

ZES_altu_mili_4_4:0 "The Fervor of Freedom"
ZES_altu_mili_4_4_desc:0 "It is easy to explain militia members what they fight for. However, it is less obvious for a professional soldier to whom the idea of defending their homes gets more abstract as time goes by and not all follow politics. Let us prepare documentation and medias to explain to them what our cause is about and instill some fervor in their hearts."

ZES_altu_mili_5_1:0 "Built Upon Strength Of Our People"
ZES_altu_mili_5_1_desc:0 "A professional army cannot rely on local mustering and sense of duty to their community. To base an army on a large professional volunteer force, we will need a whole recruitment infrastructure able to convince more than just the politically engaged few. We will also need to prepare the set up of new regiments to achieve some degree of uniformization between troops."

ZES_altu_mili_5_2:0 "Advanced Training Methods"
ZES_altu_mili_5_2_desc:0 "A professional training regimen cannot just be a full-time version of those used by the militias. Rather, a modern and professional army ought to be prepared to act in various specialized roles and still be able to fight in a cohesive fashion. To achieve that, we will need to design specialized training regimen and a proper method to assign soldiers to the role in which they can excel in."

ZES_altu_mili_5_3:0 "Lay Fire Upon Our Enemies"
ZES_altu_mili_5_3_desc:0 "Modern warfare needs guns of the larger kind but it's not enough to simply produce more and bigger cannons. One needs to know how to use them more effectively, lest we might as well fire money at our enemies. Let us call on colonel Wojtek. He has some expertise and ideas he has been dying to share with us."

ZES_altu_mili_5_4:0 "Dedicated Support Units"
ZES_altu_mili_5_4_desc:0 "By designating specialized support units created out of veteran corps of the Skapatoria Programa, we can augment our military with the best of the best when it comes to asymmetric warfare and tactics. These units will give us the edge when it comes to battling against the larger armies of the tyrant powers."

ZES_altu_mili_6_1:0 "Projektu Bóka Bedju"
ZES_altu_mili_6_1_desc:0 "Production and training are paramount to ensure the material fitness of our army. However, all weapons we can use and produce have been designed years if not decades in the past. Scientists and industrials will provide us with better projects in time but there are ways to speed up the process. A little concerted effort and extra funding now can make us gain years."

ZES_altu_mili_6_2:0 "Arm Our Soldiers With Best Rifles"
ZES_altu_mili_6_2_desc:0 "Each soldier can only be as effective as his personal abilities and weapons allow him to be. Training can only be improved on so much but there is no end to how much you can improve on a gun. However, it takes time and funding to develop them. Let us take time to set up a specification file to send to our engineers to speed up the next steps of the process."

ZES_altu_mili_6_3:0 "Shovels For Everyone"
ZES_altu_mili_6_3_desc:0 "Support equipment is probably among the least glamorous part of a soldier's toolbox but it is no less vital. For now much of our equipment are either variants of civilian tools or imported from Macawia with Harpy morphology in mind. Let us draft specifications for tools fit for our diverse force so we can finally hear less stories about how hard it is to hold those shovels with hooves."

ZES_altu_mili_6_4:0 "Advanced Ballistic Research"
ZES_altu_mili_6_4_desc:0 "Cannons are some of the most advanced weapons we can reliably produce, use and maintain without major changes. The situation may change of course but it is safer to assume that no miracle will befall us. Therefore, it would be wise to invest in better ballistic research so we can get our hooves on some bigger cannons sooner than later."

## Navy-Air Force

ZES_navy_1:0 "Department Of Sea And Air Operations"
ZES_navy_1_desc:0 "The sea is vital to us. Without it, we have no access to Macawian aid. It is therefore instrumental that we make revisions to the way we view the sea; times have changed since our founding, and so must we."

ZES_navy_fib_1:0 "Macawian Way"
ZES_navy_fib_1_desc:0 "If we follow in the footsteps of the bigger and better Macawian navy, then they will be best placed to advise and assist us. Is there really even a choice?"

ZES_navy_fib_2:0 "Cover For Our Fleet"
ZES_navy_fib_2_desc:0 "Battleships are all well and good, but they can be sunk. Extra investment into ship screening will largely mitigate this issue."

ZES_navy_fib_3:0 "To Support Battleships"
ZES_navy_fib_3_desc:0 "While they are undoubtedly the backbone of our fleet, our battleships cannot do everything by themselves, nor is it exactly cost effective to do so. We should invest in lighter ships to make our battlegroups more flexible."

ZES_navy_fib_4:0 "Further Development Of Cruisers"
ZES_navy_fib_4_desc:0 "Cruisers complement battleships well. They are faster, cheaper, and undeniably effective at providing support as a compromise between line ship and screen."

ZES_navy_fib_6:0 "Study Macawian Projects"
ZES_navy_fib_6_desc:0 "Macawia's ships are floating behemoths. They are leagues above our own in durability and firepower. If studied, they could provide us with insights on how best to protect our own ships."

ZES_navy_fib_5:0 "Capital Ships Designes"
ZES_navy_fib_5_desc:0 "Battleships are heavy investments. Therefore, we want to make sure the investment is worth it. We must ensure we always have the most modern battleship designs"

ZES_navy_fib_8:0 "Floating Steel"
ZES_navy_fib_8_desc:0 "We will build ourselves a fleet to rival that of even the old Griffonian Empire. Every fleet has had humble beginnings. Ours will be no different."

ZES_navy_ti_1:0 "To Match Our Size"
ZES_navy_ti_1_desc:0 "As ideal as it would be to follow in Macawia's footsteps, we must accept reality; we are not an industrially competitive nation. We should aim for what we can afford, whether that path is to be walked on our own or not."

ZES_navy_ti_2:0 "Workhorse Of The Navy"
ZES_navy_ti_2_desc:0 "No matter what your fleet looks like, destroyers are essential. Without them, we might as well be sending our folk to their deaths. We should therefore invest in making our destroyers bigger and better."

ZES_navy_ti_3:0 "Silent Wolves"
ZES_navy_ti_3_desc:0 "What cannot be seen, cannot be beaten. Experimenting with submarines will give us the power to deal with larger and stronger naval powers while conserving our own strength."

ZES_navy_ti_4:0 "Death From The Depths"
ZES_navy_ti_4_desc:0 "Submarines are good and all, but they have their weaknesses. We should ensure that our submarines are capable of extended periods of operation underwater to ensure they can perform their job better."

ZES_navy_ti_5:0 "Cruisers Projects"
ZES_navy_ti_5_desc:0 "We must have some form of a competitive naval presence above the waves too. Battleships are simply out of our price range. but the comparative mobility, cost effectiveness, and ease to build of cruisers makes them a perfect counterpart to our navy"

ZES_navy_ti_6:0 "To Find The Enemy"
ZES_navy_ti_6_desc:0 "If we are to effective isolate and destroy vulnerable hostile ships, then we must know where they are. Preparing seaplane catapults to provide effective launching is a good step towards this."

ZES_navy_ti_8:0 "Underwater Armada"
ZES_navy_ti_8_desc:0 "We are death beneath the waves. Our armada will ensure the safety of Kása's shores. They will not see their doom coming."

ZES_air_1:0 "Prepare Land For Airstrips"
ZES_air_1_desc:0 "We need places to launch planes from. Therefore, we shall have to make that land available."

ZES_air_2:0 "Expand Pilots' training"
ZES_air_2_desc:0 "Planes are dangerous things to the untrained, even more so than perhaps any other vehicle in existance. We must make sure that our pilots are trained for every possible scenario, so that they are ready for anything."

ZES_air_3:0 "To Help Our Soldiers"
ZES_air_3_desc:0 "The war in the air is undoubtedly important, but if we just hold the sky for the sake of holding the sky, then we will have minimal benefit from that advantage. We should therefore begin work on planes that can support our ground forces."

ZES_air_4:0 "To Rule The Skies"
ZES_air_4_desc:0 "Air support, in whatever form it may be, is good, but without adequate fighter protection, it might as well be worthless. We should focus our efforts on developing new fighter designs to dominate the air."

ZES_air_5:0 "To Sink Enemy Ships"
ZES_air_5_desc:0 "Planes are fast, mobile, and dangerous. Ships are less so. Producing airplanes specifically designed to hunt and destroy enemy ships will give our fleets a decisive advantage."

ZES_air_6:0 "Focus On Land Support"
ZES_air_6_desc:0 "The sea is important, but even more so is our home. We should look inwards to protect what we can; our immediate threats are always going to be our neighbours, after all."

ZES_air_7:0 "Support Naval Operations"
ZES_air_7_desc:0 "If Kása is going to be attacked, it is almost certain to come from the sea. It is thus natural that the air force should work in conjunction with the navy, to give us a proper chance against a seaborn invasion."

ZES_air_8:0 "Flókus Di Nevi"
ZES_air_8_desc:0 "Our paratroopers will descend from the skies like the snow with their parachutes painting the air with dots of white. They will claim them in a harsh, icy grip as uncompromising as the winter snow"

ZES_air_9:0 "Planes Deals"
ZES_air_9_desc:0 "Supplying private aircraft firms with our blueprints may be risky, but it is essential if we want to have an airforce at all. It would take too long to build it on our own backs, and so we must look to outside help"

ZES_air_10:0 "To Know Where They Are"
ZES_air_10_desc:0 "The invention of radar has quite a few military applications. We should explore this new technology and exploit it for every advantage it can give us."

ZES_navy_dock_1:0 "Build Great Harbor Of Seguro"
ZES_navy_dock_1_desc:0 "If we want to fufill our naval ambitions, we will need to have the infrastructure to do so. Seguro is the perfect spot to launch such ambitions from; let Seguro become one of the greatest ports in the world!"

ZES_navy_dock_2:0 "Dig The Dry Docks"
ZES_navy_dock_2_desc:0 "Drydocks will allow nature to assist in the creation of our fleets. Now that the harbour itself is prepared, we should finish the infrastructure needed to begin the construction of our navy"

ZES_navy_marines_1:0 "Leões Marinhos"
ZES_navy_marines_1_desc:0 "Perhaps the most important part of our navy is the marine corps. We will train a regiment of marines to be the pride of our nation, so that the rest may look to these brave warriors as examples"

ZES_navy_marines_2:0 "Expand Marines Trainig"
ZES_navy_marines_2_desc:0 "Our marines face many perils ahead of them. It is not inconceivable to think that they might be deployed in all manner of terrain and circumstance. They should, then, be prepared for anything."

### Pre-Election Events ###
kasa.1.t:0 "The Last Convention"
kasa.1.d:0 "As delegates of the Advisory Council began to gather for the great meeting, there was a buzz of excitement in the air. All members of the council eagerly awaited Mansu Erba's 1007 yearly address, as she always had wise words on where their nation should proceed. Every one of them there knew that many problems still faced Kása, obstacles that none of the nation's founders could have foreseen so many years ago. But despite all these Kása remained strong, 50 years on from its most significant challenge to date, the nation held firm under its Avo, its Grandmother Mansu Erba.\n\nWhen the doors to the chamber opened all creatures in the room turned their heads. There stood Erba with her aid Lûa Ramedi, and as they entered, all rose. Erba shook many hooves as she made her way to the seat at the head of the circle of seats that formed the council—being helped into her wicker chair by Lûa, who then took his seat in the back of the room as he was not technically a member of the council. As this happened, all the other councillors took their seats and began to look endearingly upon their Avo.\n\nMansu Erba cleared her throat and said, "I do here declare, that the 1007 Advisory Council of Kása is open.""
kasa.1.a:0 "Hear hear!"

kasa.2.t:0 "Livru Programa"
kasa.2.d:0 "As the hall again fell to silence awaiting Erba's next remarks, she drew from her satchel a book.\n\n"I have carried this with me since my operation in Austurland in 957. It was given to me by a young pony who I, unfortunately, have not been able to track down in the years since. She had almost nothing to her name except this book and chose to give it to me as thanks. That meant it had to have some value to her. So when I first read it, I was surprised to find it was merely a book about plants found in Wingbardy far away. I had no use for it really, nor did the family I received it from, but I realised something from it; why that young pony and her family held it so dear. It was the idea of learning that is valuable to all beings. And this is a policy I have tried to build on. While I have had the honour to lead you all, we have made great strides in literacy for our nation. Libraries on wheels travel across the land, distributing books and instruction to all the people. Literacy should be a right for all of our citizens, so that we may all work towards a better, more educated future for Kása.""

Lûa looked down, expecting what was coming next.\n\n"This meeting would not be complete without addressing the problem at our northern border, however, for refugees continue to flee from tyranny from that accursed land. We are a nation of free beings dedicated to the idea that all creatures of the world should be free and possess the rights and freedoms we hold dear. With this, we are called to action to protect these ponies who flee from that wicked place called Barrad."\n\nThis drew reactions of support from the room, especially from councillor Yrmthu, an earth pony who herself was born to refugees.\n\nBut these cheers of support did little to lighten Erba's mood. She raised her hoof, quieting the crowd before continuing. "But in answering this call to action, I have failed. I did not act quick enough or decisive enough. For years now, we have been supporting the refugees, and we have made some headway. Many now have jobs in our land and are creating homes and families for themselves. But many more are still struggling. While we may be able to support them, I have failed to find a way to create for them a new home. In this, I ask for your forgiveness."\n\nNow, Yrmthu spoke up: "Avo, no one is perfect. You could not have known what a struggle it would be for the nation to overcome this. My own parents could never have known what this nation would endure when they arrived here. Even I bear some responsibility; I most likely have not done enough either. No one has yet found a perfect solution. Do not be so hard on yourself. We all must stand up and take this problem head-on. For the good of all the citizens of Kása.""

Nodding and smiling, she spoke again.\n\n"Something I am proud that I have been able to do for this nation is moving our economy forward. It has been a team effort from all of us, but I believe I can finally make this declaration: Kása is beginning to enter the modern era step by step, and I for one could not be happier about it."\n\nApplause echoed in the room but was quickly hushed as Mansu gestured her hoof to the back of the chamber.\n\n"And for all that I have someone to thank. Pasarinha." All eyes turned to the zebra at the back of the room, dressed in an old naval uniform and possessing a rough stubble of facial hair, he nodded his head and smiled at the Avo.\n\nWith a groan, Erba rolled her eyes and spoke again. "No! Get up here! We all know you love the spotlight and this is a moment well deserved."\n\nPasarinha chuckled and began to move to the front of the room, he took off his hat and bowed before the rest of the Council, earning applause from all including Erba and Lûa.\n\nErba remarked, "You have done incredible work for this nation. It is thanks to you that the factories of Seguro are running with machinery we only heard tales of not too long ago. Your shipping routes have connected us to the rest of the world, and brought me closer to Kása." Erba chuckled. "Nothing makes me happier than to speak to the citizens on the radio, where all can hear me. I still get some stage fright, but I love it none the less. So thank you very much, Pasarinha."\n\nThe room once again applauded as the former naval captain once again took his seat."

We could not be more grateful for your assistance in these trying times. Thanks as well to the ever-helpful diplomat Silera Medu, who has been working with the ambassador."\n\nErba gestured to a tall, lanky zebra seated next to Tómas, much in contrast to the Harpy's sturdier frame.\n\n"You two have done great work in fostering the bond between our two nations," she said before turning to the rest of the Council. "Macawia was our first ally in the battle against tyranny, and we are happy to count them still on that list. The Pact of 907 still stands firm in our minds, and we are proud of the partnership that developed here. We share each other's values, and we fight the same fight. While we struggle against the slavers and despots of this continent, Macawia battles the tyrants of Colthage, and in that struggle, we wish you the best."\n\nWith this, the councillors cheer, and Erba walked to shake the Macawian Ambassador's claw.

kasa.6.d:0 ""While we do everything we can to secure the safety of our citizens within our nation, there are those nearby our borders who wish to do us harm."\n\nThe mood in the room grew grim: Councillor Yrmthu was visibly shaken and was knocking her hoof on the floor, and many other councillors were similarly agitated.\n\n"To our east lies Austurland. Whether we can count them among friends or foes seems to be up to their new Jarl, Ygritte. None of us can say for sure what type of person she is, so we must always be wary of her. To the west is Gryphus. As we speak, they hold a congress at Riaportu plotting their nation's next move. While their current regime is not aligned against us, we are not their friends." Erba's speech gained a rash tone as she continued. "They would gladly wish for our citizens to be subjected to the will of their orders of knights and their ruthless corporations."\n\nThe room stood in shock as a coughing fit wracked Mansu Erba. Regaining her breath, she raised a hoof to decline help, calming herself as she continued in a less rabid tone. "Gryphus does not stand for freedom. We can hope one day they may embrace these ideals, but until then, we must be on guard."\n\nErba took a moment to read the room. Her coughs had rattled the councillors, but she recovered quickly. "To our north lies the 'nation' of Barrad. As discussed previously, the treatment of their people is abominable and has caused many to flee into our nation's arms. I believe our policy should be this: wipe them from the continent one way or another."\n\nCouncillors around the room nodded, their previous scare seemingly forgotten. "Even farther north lies Wittenland and the River Coalition. While many of these nations have embraced the same freedom we have here in Kása, they still hold slavers and tyrants in their midst. We must be wary of a silver tongue backed up by iron chains. Our policy should be to not provoke these nations, as I believe we may one day be friends.

Yrmthu, out of the corner of her eye, noticed Lûa's surprise as well. Whatever came next, it must have been important. The pony met eyes with Pasarinha, who bore a stern look on his face. Gazing upon the faces gathered that day, the mare knew that none of them was ready for what came next.\n\n"I have led this nation for forty years. It is a part of me as much I am a part of it. You all call me the Avo behind my back, I know that, and I have learned to accept it. While thus far, I have talked about change, I now want to speak of things to remain the same. This Council has advised me for all my time as the First Commander. Its faces may have changed, but its spirit is always the same. Democratic elections, limits on terms, they must remain a pillar of Kása for as long as this nation draws breath. Our laws have stayed the same in spirit, and while we have needed to modernize them to the standards of the day, they must always protect those who may not be able to protect themselves and guard the rights and liberties of all our citizens. This spirit must never change."\n\nMansu Erba paused, taking a deep breath. When she resumed, she spoke in a hushed tone. "Though I should not busy you all with too many words, for there is one more thing that needs some change in Kása.""

He stammered out a sentence: "But Avo, we ne—"\n\nErba cut him short. "I am not to be Kása's Avo any longer. My health is waning, and I am growing weaker, both of mind and body. And we are entering an age of problems that I am just not prepared to face. These are the issues of steel and electricity, of modern politics and diplomacy. I can not lead you all any longer. I will work with the government to organize elections for a new First Commander, and then I shall be off to live the rest of my life. I have a husband to get back to, you know."\n\nThe shock finally settled in among those present, any who were not already seated found themselves floored. There were shaking heads and teary eyes. Even the Macawian ambassador showed signs of emotion over this.\n\nSuddenly, Yrmthu rose. "But Mansu!" she exclaimed. "This is so sudden! What if Kása is not ready for this?"\n\nErba, with a smile, said, "Of course Kása is ready. It has been my life's work to prepare it for a moment that I didn't even know would come. I know as well as you all that every First Commander has led Kása for life. But I can not go on any longer. Sometimes, I believe I am the tiredest creature in the world." Mansu Erba sat calmly, and a moment of silence wound through the room. Every creature in attendance realized she was genuine. As Erba saw this, she went on.\n\n"Please, all of you, know that I have made this decision taking everything I can into account. I was elected in a crisis, and I have lived in a crisis since then. I've looked forward to the day where I can wake up in my own home, and live my life as a mother and grandmother without the concerns of a nation weighing on my spirit. Believe me, I value highly the work I have done for this nation, and I am filled with joy to see its success, but I am still a mare, and I have things I would like to do with myself. You all shower me with praise for what I have done, but after today..."\n\nErba closed her eyes and sighed deeply. "After today, please look upon me as just another citizen of this nation. As another creature basking in the liberty and freedom that Kása guarantees to all who live within its borders. I know already many of you shall ask me for advice on how to preserve our nation and its traditions, so I shall address that now. As long as your hearts are interwoven with the spirit of freedom and of liberty, then you do not need the words of any single zebra, for you can simply listen to your own heart, and it shall guide you to a brighter tomorrow. I have already given you my thoughts on the state of our nation today, and if you wish for the last testament of my political life, use that if you wish. But remember, while Kása may be a part of me, it is a part of all of you as well. Do not let any forces cloud that perception in your minds. Kása may be a nation, but it is also a spirit. And that spirit lives within all of us. Thank you."\n\nMansu Erba, the Avo of Kása, rose from her seat. Walking with a vitality she has not possessed in years, she left the Council Hall and entered the passenger seat of a car. Beside her was her husband, and together they drove off to their country home."

## Election events ##

kasa.9.t:0 "The Sinu Scandal"
kasa.9.d:0 "One of the very first electoral debates took place in the old square of Ilha Roca where, more than a century ago, Kása saw the birth of its democracy. Many had expected it to be relatively calm while the locals were still in the shock of Mansu Erba's demission, but in the end, the debate quickly got heated. The Ilha Rocans had been enraged for days after the press broke the news of a corruption case in Seguro. A councilmare named Sinu was facing charges over an alleged corruption from a Macawian private company seeking to build a branch office in the Kásan capital. However, the case was made complex by Sinu's decision to turn herself in for accepting a large sum of money and gifts from the company, arguing that she had misinterpreted the company's intent. The company, in turn, tried to claim the whole affair had all been a massive misunderstanding caused by internal and translation errors. The involvement of a relatively popular politician and the specifics of the case made the matter hugely controversial in Ilha Roca as the locals' disdain of corruption is well known.\n\nUpon being asked about the matter, each of the candidates took a stance and explained their position. Lûa Ramedi argued that the law was clear: everyone ought to face charges though lenient ones in the case of Sinu, considering that she turned herself in. Yrmthu pounced on the argument, arguing that leniency would send the wrong message to the private sector and civil servants. She would instead give harsh sentences, especially the company who had no excuse for attempting bribery. Áltu Kexa, in turn, agreed with Yrmthu over the evident foul play at the company's hooves but argued that Sinu acted in good faith and was not at fault. Worse, she considered that it would be criminal to remove a virtuous public servant for a private company's wrongdoing. Pasarinha finally intervened, arguing that there was little point in tearing each other apart over a so-called bribery case being reported by the alleged bribed. Instead, he claimed that it would serve as a lesson for everyone in Kása, and that they ought to forgive both Sinu and the company since there was no harm done."

She lost her seat and cannot campaign for the next ten years. The company involved, for its part, was fined for a significant sum.\n\nThe judge overseeing the case lauded the Kásan public for remaining dignified and trustful of their institutions despite the politicisation of the issue that had occurred during the electoral campaign.

The involved company faced a penalty for a moderate sum of money.\n\nIn his speech, the judge scolded Sinu for letting herself be so naive as to accept gifts from professional contacts in the first place. In response, Sinu solemnly promised to never again engage in such behaviour and publicly apologised for disappointing her constituents. The judge then addressed the public, warning against a lax attitude towards the matter of corruption in Kása. He reminded all that ignorance is the first step towards the decay of harmony.

Corruption and bribery, even from the well-intentioned or well-liked, will weaken the foundation as sure as any slaver or knight of Opinicus. "Justice enforced by mob rule, even if it is well-meaning, is no justice at all." he said.\n\nUpon leaving the court of justice, Sinu supporters jeered at the judge.

kasa.10.t:0 "The Wingalac Strike"
kasa.10.d:0 "The candidates' journey to Seguro went smoothly, but when they arrived at the brand new public square where they would hold the debate, quarrelling citizens met them. It was unclear what the dispute was over, but it died down as the candidates settled in the discussion. One of the angry citizens present during the quarrel spoke up to ask a question. He spoke of the current strike occurring at the Wingalac canned food plant; the workers complained of low pay, lack of safety equipment, and bad hours. They explained that the local manager had his hooves tied in any negotiation because only the Macawian office could implement change in the company's management. For weeks now, the Macawian branch of Wingalac refused to meet the workers in any way.\n\nÁltu Kexa intervened first, happily supporting the strikers for their brave stand against Wingalac. She called upon these foreign managers to leave their greed behind or that perhaps the Kásans would decide to take their well-earned money elsewhere and spend it on other, more respectable products. Pasarinha quickly intervened to denounce Áltu's rhetoric as harmful and argued that the strike ought to used constructively rather than as a political tool. He claimed that the Macawians were overall extremely responsible in their dealings and that Kásans could not expect a fortune as a salary when the average Kásan, rural or urban, often had to make do with less than them. Yrmthu criticized Pasarinha in kind, arguing that it would be absurd to expect of Kásans to be content to live in misery. She could understand that a company's means were limited, sure, but the fact that the management had failed to even meet once with the workers indicated bad faith on its part. The press then turned to Lûa Ramedi, who explained that the workers were right to strike, but that the issue was beyond this particular strike. With the law being unclear on such matters, he argued that significant legislative changes in the labour regulations were necessary along with an overall renegotiation with Macawia in the case of trade. He asked both the strikers and Wingalac to act responsibly, advising Wingalac specifically to talk with the workers before the government decided for them."

The workers resumed their activities after reaching an agreement between labour representatives and the Wingalac managers sent from Macawia to negotiate. The deal included a permanent representation of the worker on the company's board meetings and more executive power being transferred to the Kásan branch to prevent future breakdowns of communication, such as those that brought the workers to strike. Also included in the deal were a small reduction in working hours, the creation of safety guidelines, and a formalisation of the payment method.\n\nDespite being heavily politicised, the strike remained peaceful overall, and while the public supported the movement, none of the candidates directly and publicly lent their support to the workers.\n\nInterviews with the workers showed that the agreement did much to restore trust between the company and the Wingalac management. The press releases of the company in Macawia also boasted about their improved relationship with the workers. They released a statement in the Kásan press expressing hope that the negotiation could serve as inspiration for any future legislative change in Kása."

kasa.48.t:0 "The Bernardo Controversy"
kasa.48.d:0 "This week, a former member of the administration named Carloz Bernardo caused a great deal of upheaval in the press. In his multiple interviews, he aired his grievances against the government by claiming that he was worried about Lûa Ramedi's popularity and likely election. He detailed many instances in which Mansu Erba's government erred and engaged in nepotistic and authoritarian activities. Initially, many took his claims at face value, but as the controversy grew, Bernardo's claims became more farfetched and contradictory. In some instances, he asserted that Ramedi had conspired to force Mansu Erba into retirement in something approaching a coup. In others, it was the former First Commander herself who suppressed political opponents throughout Kása to install her heir into power. Accusations of corruption took an increasingly conspiratorial turn as Bernardo described Ramedi and Erba as being agents of everyone: from the Order of Opinicus to the Nimbusians or even the Colthaginians.\n\nThough the assertions have tarnished his reputation, Ramedi debunked many of the more plausible ones by releasing detailed documentation that proved his innocence and foul play on the part of Bernardo. In the end, Carloz Bernardo declared himself a candidate to the election despite being well past the deadline for filing a candidacy. When confronted about this, Bernardo lashed out, stating that his political opponents changed the electoral process to prevent him from 'saving' Kása. In the end, this last stunt mostly put an end to Bernardo's political adventure and the scandal."

Ramedi happily obliged and gave a long and detailed talk on the duties of the First Commander and the implications of constitutional control of legislative and executive work.\n\nThis conference would have been nothing more than a footnote of the election if not for an exchange reported by a reporter. During the debate section, the professor elaborated on an obscure part of the constitution after a student's question. He was, however, interrupted by Lûa Ramedi, who explained that his response was incorrect. The professor shrugged off the direct intervention by saying in jest, "This is why you only invite politicians to constitutional studies sometimes." Despite the comment, Lûa Ramedi went on, quoting the article of the constitution in question, and even referring both a significant court precedent on the matter and a little bit of history regarding the making of said article. Ramedi was proven correct by a student who provided a constitutional textbook, much to the apparent dismay of the professor."

For all that was said about the importance of it, the innovativeness of the candidate's typical tour and the press coverage, it all felt like a coronation. Lûa Ramedi was the favourite, and he was seen as the best candidate. Not one for outbursts and with a steady hoof as a civil servant, everyone knew that Mansu Erba thought highly of him. Yes, Lûa Ramedi seemed the obvious choice; he would lead Kása, and it would be for the better.\n\nBut to many, there was a sense of disappointment. Was democracy supposed to be about just selecting the most qualified and safe candidate? Wasn't there something cry out about, something to do that was beyond that was reasonable? Sometimes, what was right was not necessarily what made the most budgetary sense. And while it was good to be well-lead, sometimes it was more important for the populace to participate in the matters of state. There was a reason, after all, that Kásans believed in democracy and didn't crown Akeeku as their king, even if he would have made a splendid one.\n\nNo: there was a need to do more. There were more than one good Kásan who also ought to have a say. Yrmthu would give them that voice."

Despite the demand for a meeting from the strikers, the company's management back in Macawia never visited the factory. They instead raised salaries and cut working hours in an announcement through the local managers. In addition, a translated set of guidelines delineating worker safety used in Macawian factories of Wingalac for workers fluent in Kásan and Wittenlandic was in the works. The announcement satisfied most of the workers, but some protested and continued the strike for better conditions; the remaining strikers were promptly fired.\n\nThe strike was generally peaceful to the end, despite some of the laid-off workers threatening both the management and some former colleagues, whom they considered being 'scabs'. Additional reporting showed that the strike saw little public support following the initial politicisation of the issue.\n\nThe reaction of the Wingalac management to the end of the strike was relatively muted. Some journalists tried to conduct interviews, though few workers were willing to speak. Those who did talk publicly claimed that the situation was getting better, but feared that future strikes would only get harder if nozebra was daring enough to force the management to a sit-down."

kasa.52.t:0 "Undiplomatic Compliments"
kasa.52.d:0 "Today, a small controversy was caused by the release in the press of the interview with the Macawian ambassador. Overall, the interview was hardly problematic, and the ambassador went through various consensual talking points. Eventually, however, he spoke of the mutual benefits that would come from the relationship between Macawia and Kása 'once First Commander Pasarinha is elected'. Pressed on this statement by the journalist, the ambassador walked on his words in full, explaining that he misspoke because he had not gotten enough sleep. He claimed to mean 'once the First Commander is elected', and that because he had just read an article speaking extensively about Pasarinha, he had a slip of the tongue. The ambassador explained that he was reading up on all of the candidates and that the misstatement was only an unfortunate coincidence. Unconvinced by the explanation, the journalist wrote extensively about the awkwardness that followed as the ambassador kept denying he was endorsing Pasarinha in any shape or form.\n\nAfter the publishment of the article, many began to refer to Pasarinha as 'Macawia's candidate', though very few went as far as to claim that Macawia would directly interfere the election in Pasarinha's favour."

kasa.53.d:0 "This week, the Macawian Irmaos company announced a deal with several small Kásan paper mills and printing companies to establish a large factory north of Seguro. The announcement came as a surprise, as Irmaos had officially had failed to reach a similar deal the previous year. Officially, the press communiqué of the company spoke of the incredible opportunities existing in Kása and of the welcoming atmosphere towards foreign investors.\n\nLater in the week, an investigative journalist wrote an article in which he summarised several interviews of employees of Irmaos and those of the domestic companies. Speaking under the condition of anonymity, they painted a less rosy picture than that from the Irmaos representatives. The project, even if it were sound, would create fewer jobs than claimed by the Irmaos company. Several of the anonymous workers also credited Pasarinha's popularity in the election as a determinant factor in the company's decision, though he played no direct part in the process."

Most conversations went from who to support to what would Pasarinha do once in charge, and how would he deal with various matters. However, not everyone saw 'Kása's accountant' as the best choice for First Commander. The more he spoke, the more some people felt the lack of candour in his words and instead, the dryness. Sure, his speeches were logical and appeared professional. But were carefully prepared words and a calm demeanour all that there was to democracy?\n\nAs such, citizens listened or read about Áltu Kexa's speeches in growing frequency. There was a righteous fury in her words, directing the anger at everything that was going wrong in the world. It was not like the news painted a better picture of it all either: who could focus on the fine prints of trade policy when creatures were dying by the thousands in Prywhen or Longsword? When there were still slaves wasting away to fatten their masters in Nimbusia or Colthage? Sitting idly by felt wrong; Kása ought to do something! To some, it seemed as if Pasarinha who spoke so little of it and didn't care.

The strikers returned to work after reaching an agreement with the Wingalac managers sent from Macawia to negotiate. The deal mainly focused on a significant rise in pay for all workers, though the implementation of safety guidelines and reduction of working hours were less substantial.\n\nThe strike intensified after it became a national issue during the electoral campaign. Emboldened by public support, the strikers found numerous ways to ask Wingalac to send a negotiation team. It culminated in a moment of international solidarity with Macawian workers protesting at the company's headquarters. Some see the Wingalac strike as a watershed moment for the Kásan labour movement, and there were rumours of growing calls for unionization in the country.\n\nSome interviews conducted among the workers indicated that the agreement was welcomed and celebrated as a great victory. Back in Macawia, Wingalac did not comment on the strike at its headquarters and dodged questions when pressed by the local press."

This news came as little surprise, previous negotiations to purchasing and expanding local paper mills had yielded no results.\n\nWhat would have been a mere footnote took a turn when leaked information published in the Macawian press detailed the Irmaos company's fears of Yrmthu's victory in the Kásan election as a deciding factor for the cancellation of the plans. Reportedly, even if not elected, her popularity showed that doing business in Kása carried significant risk. Some Macawian board members supposedly went so far as to call her a closeted socialist, a surprising accusation considering the lack of traction that socialist thought had in Kása. This revelation travelled overseas and made it to the headlines in the Kásan press. Some business leaders and captains of industry turned on Yrmthu over her apparent capacity to turn away foreign business. The majority of workers, however, have begun to see Yrmthu's message of decentralization as a step in the right direction."

The locals took control of a worker camp alongside the road and have blocked access to the workers.\n\nAccording to the protestors, the plan would have caused a great deal of damage to their lives as the planned road would go straight through fields and grazing lands. Worse, the project includes only one underpass to allow locals to go from one side to the other despite more than half of the village's agriculture being on the other side of the proposed road. The protesters explained to the press that the whole project was particularly egregious because if the route only deviated a bit to the west, it would go through unused land. The protest was largely supported by Yrmthu, who said that such easily preventable issues would never happen if the government gave local communities additional oversight power over building projects.\n\nSoon after the protest, Seguro sent envoys to negotiate and plan a new route for the road."

It looked as if the wind was finally turning as many members of society, used to having little to no say about it, have now realised that they mattered just as the First Commander. No longer refugees, Skapatoria survivors, or forgotten rural inhabitants, they were all true Kásans.\n\nThis shift wouldn't come by smoothly, however. Some felt that this idealism, while laudable, could happen in ways that would irrevocably hurt the country. After all, had Kása not already stood for those with no voice? The change would sure have come by eventually, so there was no need to rush or be discontented. Kása already did much to alleviate the poor souls from Barrad during the Xatisa years. However, what of the store-owner? What of the average worker in Seguro or Fyrport? What of the forgotten Kásans who wordlessly toiled, prayed, and paid their dues with no complaint? Were they not allowed to have the chance to thrive, simply because they were not the worst off?\n\nThose with these concerns had a need, and they called for an administration that understood their plight. They called for an administration that knew of an important mantra: to give to others, one must be sure that they have enough for themselves. The people called for a leader who could ensure that everyone would be fed and allow Kása to grow and prosper rather than eke through survival. In short, they needed an accountant, a businesscreature; they needed Pasarinha."

The deal includes a reduction in working hours, a formalization of breaks, and the establishment of strong safety guidelines, procedures and equipment.\n\nThe strike intensified after it became a national issue during the electoral campaign. The strike spilt over in Seguro and Ilha Roca where supporters of the movement engaged in a boycott of the company and protested at the Macawian embassy. In a now emblematic moment, a few foals were caught by a photographer merrily painting a graffiti over Wingalac advertisement in front of a Seguro general shop. While the protest remained peaceful, supporters of the movement threw rotten eggs at one of the Wingalac representatives present for the deal.\n\nPress interviews of workers involved with the strike indicate that the strikers welcomed the deal and celebrated it as a victory. In Macawia, the Wingalac company decried the lack of support from either Macawia or Kásan governments during the negotiations. They also called the episode of the graffiti and the rotten egg as worrying signs of deteriorating Kásan-Macawian relations."

In a speech, the secretary-general of the KBA said that his association didn't take to the streets lightly, but saw the rising popularity of Áltu Kexa as more than just a politician's popularity. They argued that her speeches, though passionate and sincere as they may be, were dripping with a carelessness when it came to due process and the rule of law, if not outright contempt for such concepts. They pleaded for the poet to remind herself, as a poet should know, of the gravitas of the words and their meaning. A successful democracy was impossible without passion for the destitutes of the world. However, it was also a cultural attitude, one that did not treat democratic institutions as obstacles to overcome but as integral and vital parts of the democratic process."

kasa.61.d:0 "Today a striking image made the front page of many newspapers in Kása after a recruitment office for the military became the scene of a party. While Kásans had never been shy about joining those who would protect them from foreign threats, those who lived around the recruitment centres have seen some changes in recent weeks: hundreds of young creatures flocking to enlist themselves or become reservists. Now one office in Seguro has seen such a line of would-be volunteers that they had to leave many creatures hanging at the end of the day. These youngsters decided to wait by organising a party that lasted until the following day. They scattered to bring back food, instruments, and cheap alcohol. While they were certainly showing off the vigour of youth, many regretted it the morning after as the ensuing hangovers made their physical examination significantly harder, if somewhat amusing.\n\nThe journalists visiting the scene asked the partying patriots why they wished to enlist. Most repeated many of the typical reasons, though many also mentioned being inspired by Áltu Kexa. To them, it was as if Kása had grown complacent and was no longer aware of the importance of fighting for one's freedom. They wanted to fight tyranny wherever it was, to become heroes just like Akeeku or the Ebyron heroes, and most importantly, to do their duty as Kásans."

kasa.62.d:0 "For weeks now, the atmosphere in Kása was burning with enthusiasm. Each day, the fiery speech of Áltu Kexa captured the minds of many and animated discussions around the dinner table. There was outrage and a desire to do more, much more. The was the desire to finally roar instead of moping around and listening to the endless chatter.\n\nBut to some, all of this passion and energy did not feel empowering: it was instead dangerous. Áltu Kexa was undoubtedly right in reminding everyone of the evils of tyranny and slavery, but was it the correct way? Not all of the continent was that bad. Indeed, Kása was not alone after all. Some countries in the Riverlands were alright, and there was Asterion. Heck, wasn't that Kemerskai fellow still trying to fight for democracy in those faraway lands? Knowing this, was it so wise to do so much sabre-rattling? They were but a small country, after all.\n\nTo the sceptics, it felt as if there was a need for cooler heads to prevail: someone who knew what they were talking about; someone who would seek other venues than war if there was a way, no matter the difficulties. Yrmthu had her heart in the right place, sure, but she too seemed to place passion over reason. As for Pasarinha, he was... fine? No, they mostly trusted Lûa Ramedi. He had followed Mansu Erba for many years, and when he spoke, he always went into details of every matter. There was neither vagueness nor slogans in his words—only real, actionable ideas."

kasa.11.t:0 "The Boycott"
kasa.11.d:0 "As the candidates made their way to Fyrport, Kása's westernmost port and home to the biggest Gryphusian community in the country, they were immediately met by a controversy that was sure to be the main topic of debate in the public square.\n\nThe controversy revolved around accusations made by Kásan native Gryphusians that many products sold in Gryphusian-owned stores in the city were instead products made and sold by the hated Gryphusische Südkontinent-Gesellschaft. Such allegations are not entirely baseless, as the Gryps-Süd GmbH is well known to use less-than-ethical methods to produce their goods. These accusations have caused protests to break out in front of the stores and raised a call for the boycott of said stores and their products, barely stopping short of direct clashes. Several store owners accused Kásan radicals of needlessly stoking the fire and that the accusation was nothing but slander.\n\nDuring the debate, each candidate made clear their position regarding the matter. Yrmthu was the first to speak, praising the community for taking such a complicated issue into their hooves and claws and doing so in a peaceful fashion. She advised the community to support local products from regional farmers and craftcreatures instead and called for national and regional 'morality testing' regarding the conditions in which products are made. Pasarinha spoke next and advised that this was a perfect example of Kása's need to better and preemptively screen companies doing business within its borders. However, he asked for the locals to remain open for dialogue with the store owners to clear any misunderstandings and to integrate them as part of the solution. Áltu Kexa pushed back against Pasarinha, referring the protesters as lovers of freedom. She warned that only constant vigilance as displayed here would prevent the greedy and amoral Gryphusian strand of capitalism from slithering its way into Kása. Lûa Ramedi concluded the exchange by supporting the idea of a boycott as a valid and lawful method of protest but urged the protesters to maintain their choice of peaceful action. He also called for an independent committee to investigate the claims and take legal action against the store owners who violated Kása's ban on slave-made products."

Oh, what she wouldn't give to have been a hippogriff.\n\nShe barely held back from heaving her breakfast when Lûa Ramedi walked up to her.\n\n"A fine day, isn't it?" he asked in greeting. "I'm eager to see Oferclif. It really has been too long since I've set a hoof there." His eyes met Yrmthu's. "It's your hometown, right?"\n\n"Retorno," Yrmthu managed to say before swallowing her nausea. "We call it Retorno—have been for years, but nopony has ever bothered to update the official maps. It wouldn't be a problem if the city council integrated the camps."\n\n"Ah." Lûa nodded sagely. "I'm sure we'll get around to do it in due time. We've talked about it with Avo once. There were so many things about that place that she held close to her heart. However, she always held the principle that first and foremost, Kása ought to care for her citizens and her guests. I'm sure the refugees will agree on this." He smiled. "I certainly do."\n\nYrmuthu groaned. "We've been cared for years now, Lûa. Our Avo cared for us all her life and what good did it do in the end? I'm still here, and so are my parents and everyone else. We're not your guests anymore. We're Kásans just as much as you are. What they all need is a seat at the table, not a representative or a little bit more food allowance." Her eyes glowered as she said, "We want justice. We want the Xatisa to end, and we won't stay on the sideline."\n\nLûa frowned. It was rare for him to do so, and he coldly replied: "You've been part of our government for years now. You know that we didn't have the budget to do anything else but mitigate the damage of the Xatisa. Mansu—"\n\n"I know, Lûa!" Yrmthu exclaimed. "We know! Trust me on this. We've listened to this speech thousands of times: budget constraints. But it's not an issue of budget balance to us, nor should it be for Kása. It is a crisis, a crisis that we can end. And I don't want Mansu Erba to die while it still goes on, nor my parents for that matter."\n\nLûa pondered for a moment but didn't object. In the end, he offered her a slight smile."

kasa.12.d:0 "When the ship bringing the candidate from Fyrport to Oferclif, or Retorno as the Barradians refugees liked to call it, there was a sense of unease among most of them. The town and its massives refugees camps had been the greatest failure of the early days in Mansu Erba's government. It was easy to forget what the Xatisa meant back in Seguro, but when it all made sense when coming here. In this day of clear weather, the Barradian mountain range in the distance was visible, as were the ominous and unnatural clouds looming over it.\n\nWhen the debate started, the very first question from the public was about the recent arrest of a group of paramilitary griffons who sought to cross the border into Barrad and attempt to free it themselves. This sort of thing had happened many times, and Mansu Erba had always condemned it. Now, however, each of the candidates had to explain their position on the matter.\n\nÁltu Kexa, who had no history with Barrad or the Xatisa, spoke first. In a fiery speech, she called the Barradian overlords the worst tyrants of them all and the cruellest abusers of magic. She called for volunteers to be released while advised them to have a bit of patience as she clarified her intention to use military force to put an end to the Barrad crisis, once and for all. Yrmthu, a Barradian native, spoke next. She didn't use a bellicose language but said that the end of the Barradian tragedy was long overdue and that she would not hesitate when it came to the question of Barrad. She called for a conditional release of the volunteers, warning them not to take individual actions as the mages of Barrad were dangerous. There were already too many graves showing that overconfidence was indeed an insidious killer. Lûa Ramedi chastised the volunteers, calling such hasty actions reckless and needlessly risky, for their cause and even for Kása as a whole, as it could mean retaliatory military action from Wittenland as legally, Barrad was still Wittenlandic territory. Pasarinha ended the discussion by saying that he sympathized with the volunteers and called for their release. However, he strongly warned them to reconsider their life choices, as blind vengeance was only destructive. He mentioned how he had found himself while serving in the navy and added that perhaps enlisting in the local militia would be the best way for the youths to find their purpose in life."

kasa.64.d:0 "The car assigned to Àltu Kexa and Yrmthu was slowly making its way towards Aebbercurnig. It was a difficult road, but it had started harder already. As they entered it, a deer protestor heckled them, accusing Yrmthu of prioritizing the liberation of Barrad while his brethren were still dying under the rule of Austurland. Yrmthu spoke to the protestor, pointing that her platform includes the emancipation of Austurland. However, the deer displayed his support for Àltu while accusing Yrmthu of only caring about Wittenlandic creatures. At that point, Yrmthu snapped and told the protestor off. The car ride continued in tense silence, with Yrmthu appearing disheartened until Àltu decided to speak.\n\n"I cannot fathom your attitude, Yrmthu," said Àltu. "You of all of the Council's creatures ought to know what it's like to live under the tyranny. You fled for your lives and yet are content to live here in freedom. It all sounds very egoistic of you. First come, first serve." She shook his head. "What hypocrisy!"\n\n"Don't you dare put words in my mouth or those of my brothers and sisters," Yrmthu said with clenched teeth. "You are not our representative, nor will you ever be! We're not a tool for you to use. What would you even know of tyranny? You can't even begin to understand what we have fled from! We fled from war, and forty years later, we are still recovering from it! Your flippant approach to war will only cause more destruction and displace more creatures." Her tone grew quiet but remained harsh. "What good is freedom if all you can give those creatures afterwards is a pat on the back and excuses while they starve?"\n\nÀltu's eyes hardened. "Isn't that what the slavers themselves say? Oh, at least they have a roof over their head and food on the table," she said mockingly. "They're provided for, unlike the poor in free countries. How wholesome! There ought to be no hierarchy when it comes to suffering, and we need to listen to every grievance. The plight of Austurland is no different from that of Barrad. And when you make distinctions, you will always end up saying that the lives of the thralls of Austurland are worth less than those of the Barradians."\n\n"That's the problem, miss Kexa," Yrmthu replied, maintaining the quiet fury in her words. "You don't really care about their lives. To the creature that lies dying alone in a ditch because of war, freedom matters little. There is more to both it and liberty than speeches and glory." She leaned back into her seat. "So you can tell those voters all they want, but you're not ready for what is to come."\n\nÀltu glared at Yrmthu but held her tongue.

No wonder it had dissuaded many in Austurland to attempt an invasion with such a city to overcome or leave in their back. It was true that Aebbercurnig was not the richest or city, nor the most beautiful but from its wall, you could see Austurland and for the many freed deers living in the cities, such a sight was a constant reminder that the land of their personal Tartarus was still there, still enforcing slavery and pain for so many. The city was not just the home of many refugees brought by the Skapatoria program, it was also proportionally the most common city of origin for those serving under Kása's flag. Here was a city where they understood the meaning of dying for the cause.\n\nWhen the debate began on the public square, many in attendance were legionaries and militiacreatures allowed to participate. Of course, this lead much of the debate to be about military matters such as the role and future of the Kásan Foreign Legion.\n\nPasarinha spoke first and lauded the Legion for its service. He called for an expansion of the legion as a great way to cultivate the military relationship between Macawia and Kása and called the Kásan exemplary for helping to make this great collaboration so successful. Lûa Ramedi followed suit by calling for a continuation of the current situation and expanding both forces in accordance both to the level of threat and to the growth of the country. He argued that the Kásan model worked well and was in no need of radical change. Áltu Kexa criticized them both, emphasizing the need to drastically expand the Kásan military so that it would be able to stand and defend itself without any need for foreign help. Yrmthu, finally, argued that the Legion ought to be integrated into a unified Kásan military to better emphasize the Kásan military independence. However, the regiments of the Foreign Legion should still remain a distinct force to account for all the special ways in which it differed from the Kásan-born units."

Àltu Kexa was quietly pondering while Pasarinha was preparing his pipe when a waiter came to ask them if they wished for anything else. Pasarinha requested "Rum. Macawian, if you have any." As the waiter left, Àltu began to giggle uncontrollably, prompting Pasarinha to stare at her. She asked: "Is there anything about you that doesn't scream your love of Macawia?"\n\n"I'm not sure what your point is, miss Kexa. Macawian rum is objectively one of the best there is."\n\n"You know what I mean. I could write an anaphoric speech about "As the Macawians say" and I'm fairly sure people would think I'm just quoting you. But joking aside, why are you this way? Surely, there must be some pride of Kása in you, some belief that we are capable of doing things just as well as Macawia if not better. So why are you so Tartarus-bent on trying to convince Kása that this is the only way to move forward, asking the Macawians to save us again and again and again?"\n\n"Elegantly put, my dear. I'll humor you. I am indeed proud of being Kásan and I believe that much in our future is bright. However, our means are limited and the Macawians are willing to provide and help. Why would I spit on such a rare windfall? If the Macawians wish to fight our wars, I shan't stop them? So while they do, I'll focus our own money and resources on building up all that we have so that when the inevitable Macawian withdrawal happens, we are able to live and act as a rich and powerful nation."\n\n"And this is why you're naught but an accountant. Kása deserves more. It deserves a national spirit of not relying on charity. It deserves a will to do things themselves. It deserves purpose. Are we to play chess only to talk about the economical ins and outs of the tower piece? Kása needs a legacy of pride and achievements, not one of a good hustle."\n\nPasarinha chuckled and shrugged. "Pride matters little when you're ash in the soil. So I'll be happy to play the part of the ancestor that my descendants will love to complain about.

And yet, despite some of the dust of the Wingalac strike settling, they were still welcomed by a population annoyed by yet another scandal in what had proved to be a sad year for the Kásan capital.\n\nWhile it had always been an open secret that finding proper housing in Seguro was a difficult business as the city seemed to be incapable to do anything but grow at neck breaking pace. And yet, everycreature thought that it wasn't all that bad. And then earlier in the month, a family of seven and several bystanders were killed or injured by the explosion of a cramped house due to a gas leak. After inspection of the local firefighters and investigation by journalists, activists and the police, many reports were produced and it painted a story far worse than many had imagined. Landlords, the now infamous "sleep merchants", had built thousands of unsanitary and shody housing units and were cramming them with poor creatures who had little alternative due to the housing shortage. And on top of that, the average rent for those accommodations barely above those of a slave was nothing short but extorsion. And all of that in the heart of Seguro.\n\nWhen the matter was brought to the public square debate, Lûa Ramedi was the first to speak. Barely concealing his anger, he called for a citywide public enquiry and said that harsh sentences and fines should be given to any of those who had profited from lax enforcement of the housing regulation, up to full expropriation and confiscation of properties that would be refurbished by the state. Yrmthu, in turn, condemned the sleep merchants but considered that it really was a symptom of a larger problem which was the mass emigration from destitute rural communities. Only by supporting ailing townships would the burden of Seguro be eased. Pasarinha for his part called for an increase of the house construction budget and a full reform of the housing code with a new and modernized city plan and firm safety laws. Finally, Áltu Kexa decried the sleep merchants as exploiters no better than slave-owners and called for them to be tried. She then called for a civilisational rejuvenation throughout Kása and called for the masses to look back to the countryside as a place they can live in as their own masters with their own lands."

After a while of wandering, he ended passing by Lûa Ramedi's cabin. The door had been left open and he saw Lûa in the middle of a true puddle of papers. He knew that scene quite well as it had happened countless time back when Lûa was just Mansu Erba's secretary. He was stuck on something and Pasarinha figured he could use a game of chess. Also Lûa was probably most likely to not pick a fight with him. As they were playing, Lûa proved quite adept but it was not surprising, though still within the bounds of his clock. He was making mistakes and taking forever playing. Pasarinha wasn't exactly sure if it was because of him planning every single moves or because whatever he was working on. No matter, he was still doing well. He was making amazing use of the queen to the point of predictability. He chuckled: "You enjoy the queen don't you?"\n\n"It is the most versatile piece in the game. It would be an inefficient choice to not use it to its full potential. Check."\n\nPasarinha then took his pawn, just nearing the edge of the board. In a single move, it would become a queen and put Lûa in checkmate. He looked at it and smirked before turning to Lûa, waiting for him.\n\n"The issue, my friend, is that you only think about the hoof you're given. You have served under and been shaped by Mansu Erba so much that you can't seem to see Kásan politics except as the continuation of her term. You're an heir, much like Yrmthu is even if she doesn't like to hear it. But it's part of what the problem is. If I had been shaped by my past, I would still be a dockhand back in Ilha Roca. But like this piece here, I worked my way to become more. I became a queen. Do you see what I mean?"\n\n"I do. But I'm afraid you still lose."\n\nPasarinha frowned before Lûa pointed him to the clock which had run out of time, causing him to lose the game as he had failed to actually put down his piece and call checkmate. Lûa smiled.\n\n"That's the issue with you, my dear Pasarinha. You enjoy telling a good story, or rather a lesson about maturity, too much.""

After all the controversies and agitation that they saw throughout the campaign, it was good to see the Kásan historical capital doing well and feeling as lively than ever. It could make one wonder if any of them could really help Kása thrive enough that every city could feel like Ilha Roca did. But this was no time for quiet pondering. It was time to campaign.\n\nThe debate went quite well and finally centered around the matter of the Skapatoria Program, one of Kása's biggest source of pride. Upon being asked about what they would do regarding it, each candidate was happy to oblige. However, they were also asked about the diplomatic pressure that were done by foreign power regarding it.\n\nPasarinha spoke first and passionately about his own service in the navy and argued that the future of the program would be at sea where much of the slave trade was still occuring. He spoke of the terrible ripple effects of the rebirth of Hauklandish piracy and how pirates from many Griffonian and Zebrican nations had begun to engage in slavery more and more. "No more D'vah", he concluded. Lûa followed by supporting tying the Skapatoria funding to a percentage of the state income rather than a fixed budget. He also vowed to push back against any pressure and instead pressure any foreign partners to abolish slavery on their own before any talks could happen. Yrmthu for her part argued that while the Skapatoria program was important and necessary, any progress it was doing were naught compared to the constant stream of misery caused by the Barrad rogue regime. She argued for a temporary reallocation of resources towards the singular goal of ending the magocracy and therefore finally put an end to the Xatisa. Áltu Kexa spoke last and denounced in decidedly undiplomatic language the oppressive regimes of Barrad and Austurland, imploring that under no circumstances should there be any shaking of hooves with those oppressors, or any."

kasa.19.d:0 "It was early in the afternoon when Áltu Kexa got on the stage of the Ilha Roca amphitheater. She was supposed to read some of her poems but her heart was not into it. They felt hollow and weak. The zebra looked at the crowd, eager to hear her speak. Was she supposed to give them all what they wanted? Something to feel good about themselves? She sighed and in a flash of clarity, threw her poems to the wind.\n\n"My dear compatriots,\n\nI wish to ask you all a question. Are we free? Do we deserve to be? The simple answer might be that we are and do because we can ask those questions. Freedom is not an alien concept nor is it a privilege that is to be gained. It is our birthright, our very natural state. Chains, debts and the very vocabulary of servitude, those are the constructs, those are the lies that deny us access to the real world and rob us of our potential.\n\nAs we speak, thousands upon thousands remain bound by those lies. In Gryphus, in Barrad, in Austurland, even in the Coalition of River hypocrites, lied to by knights, merchants, kings and so-called democratic leaders! Liars, all of them! And yet, these bound creatures have the right to think, to live, to yearn to be more because the words that would deny them those rights are but ink on paper!\n\nFor as long as it existed, Kasa has been an experiment in demonstrating this. Each day, our sisters and brothers of all walks of life get up and prove to the world at large that no life is so meaningless as to deserve to be reduced into slavery or serfdom. And yet, we have allowed this experiment to restrain itself. Mansu Erba has done many great things indeed, of that I cannot claim the contrary, but our Avo has let herself be swayed by the tepid and timid in her circle. And now, those meek of heart claim to lead us forward? Shame on us if we let that happen! Shame!\n\nKása! O Kása of my heart! How you deserve more! How the world deserves more than the champions of freedom to lie around, fat, feeble and idle. The slaves of the world deserve more resolve than to extend a hoof of peace to those who would see them enslave! In this cause of freedom, we need to be as fanatical as the knights of Opinicus, as entitled in our beliefs as the kings of Wittenland and as ruthless as those who would see us with iron around our hooves!\n\nMy name is Áltu Kexa and I hereby announce my candidacy for First Commander in the name of all who still reel under the yoke of tyranny!""

### Election aftermath events

kasa.20.t:0 "Tallying the votes"
kasa.20.d:0 "It had been a long and interesting campaign for all in Kàsa. There had been so many high moments, even if they were marred in controversy or tragedy. It was really the first time that they all got to vote in a way that would be so determinant on the choice for First Commander. Never before had the electoral system and timing of change in leadership allowed for such a thing to occur. Some nostalgic were not all that happy about it but to many, it was endearing. A new way of doing things. And for the one who would take the mantle of First Commander, it would be something to ponder upon.\n\nIn the end, the campaign ended like all others as every Kàsan went and voted for their representatives to the council. But even when the results were announced, everyone knew that it wasn't over yet as those councillors had now to vote on their choice for First Commander. There was some certitude about the vote of some of them but you could never truly be sure until the fateful vote at the Seguro Council."

The former secretary humbly swore his oath to serve Kása before taking his seat in the traditional wicker chair left vacant since the resignation of Mansu Erba.\n\nIn his victory speech, Lûa Ramedi remained brief and promised citizens that work would resume as quickly as possible for the benefit of all. He also assured that he would not be deaf to the sincere wishes expressed by those who did not offer him their suffrage, promising that he would seek to reach a virtuous consensus as much as possible."

kasa.22.t:0 "The Solemn Bookkeeper" ### Pasarinha elected
kasa.22.d:0 "In a comfortable majority, the Council of Kása nominated Pasarinha as the eighth First Commander of the Kása Free State. Despite the vote being generally calm, a few protesters in the back of the Council room deployed flags calling for answers regarding the Xatisa, oppression in Barrad and Gryphus and continued slavery in Austurland. The most agitated protesters were escorted out while most of them were allowed to remain at the request of Pasarinha himself. The former financial expert swore his oath to serve Kása before taking his seat in the traditional wicker chair left vacant since the resignation of Mansu Erba.\n\nThe new First Commander gave a speech in a quiet and restrained fashion.\n\n"It is a difficult task ahead indeed. Our nation, for all its industriousness and innovativity, has been forced to contend with many roadblocks. From the continued threat of violent actors to extremism and a land where the list of tasks ahead seems endless. However, with the help of our Macawian friends and our own limitless potential, I know that there is little that is out of our reach. My own work will not be to provide you all with answers and graces like the kings in the west but rather to offer you the means of overcoming your own issues and spread your wings. Kása ought not to be a family home led by overbearing parents but a place in which we can all benefit from an equal chance in life and grow. My hope is that we can all finally enter the adult age of Kása with a long and prosperous life ahead of us.\n\nI wish to conclude with this promise. To all Kásan workers, sailors, farmers and employees in all their diversity of skills, struggles and responsibilities, I vow before you to offer you a Kása that will prioritize your future, your prosperity and your safety above all. Thank you all and good day.""

kasa.23.t:0 "The Example" ### Yrmthu elected
kasa.23.d:0 "In a comfortable majority, the Council of Kása nominated Yrmthu as the eighth First Commander of the Kása Free State and the first Kásan of non-zebrican lineage to ever occupy the office. In a display of her desire to see a more inclusive system, she stretched the ability of the new First Commander's right to invite some creatures for the ceremony by inviting Xatisa survivors and municipal politicians from all over instead of relatives and friends. The former councillor swore her oath to serve Kása before taking her seat in the traditional wicker chair left vacant since the resignation of Mansu Erba.\n\nYrmthu's speech was short but also solemn and warm.\n\n"Forty years ago, the Barrad horror changed the lives of many thousands of creatures. None of those who fled or those who welcomed them asked for this. In this historical injustice, Kása and our dear Mansu Erba proved to the world that they were more than posturing. In this great occasion, I wish to thank all those who lived up to the creaturian ideals of the First Village as well as those who continue to do so. However, it is also time that we recognize that this seminal tragedy is still ongoing as we speak and unless all is done to put an end to it, Kása will remain forced to endure sacrifices after sacrifices to care for those castaway by the Barradian tyrants. I wish us all to be free of such burden and will do everything in my power to finally put an end to his chapter of our history, to not let Mansu Erba's tireless work be in vein.\n\nI have also heard the fear of some regarding the idea of a Wittenlandic leading this nation forward in an era where Wittenland still has much to do to prove its good faith. Let me assure all today that my intentions are to follow the spirit of the Kásan legacy from the days of Ilha Roca. It is my firm intention to see power concentrated here once more devolved to every citizen of the Free State. No betrayal would be greater than a move towards an imperial and authoritative. It is therefore with great pleasure that I'll conclude this speech to all in Kása thusly: I'll see you all soon and often. Thank you.""

kasa.24.d:0 "In a narrow majority vote, the Council of Kása nominated Áltu kexa as the eighth First Commander of the Kása Free State. The vote was difficult due to a vocal minority of councillors vehemently opposing the putative head of state. Despite their attempts at claiming the electoral campaign as non-binding, the Council eventually voted to follow the democratic choice. A few councillors still protested the election by walking out as the famed poetress swore her oath before taking her seat in the traditional wicker chair left vacant since the resignation of Mansu Erba.\n\nKexa's speech was long and fiery. Yet, in the end, it was an uncharacteristically solemn Kexa who pronounced these words:\n\n"In this day, Kása has made a fateful choice. The choice of maintaining its legacy, a legacy of the most righteous and arduous cause of all. The cause of Liberty and Abolitionism. I applaud you all, even the skepticals we suffered today, for allowing yourself to choose such a mission over the sweet yet superfluous comfort of indifference. I will not lie. The task ahead will not be one of laughter but I promise you that when all is said and done and when I'll leave this wicker chair in my dying breath, we will have been paid in full in knowing that we stood true to those who revolted on the D'Vah, to those who stood against the most dire of odds in the hope of liberty.\n\nI see many even within this venerable house who look away in fear. To those, I say this. Do not look away, citizens of Kása, for we are walking the path set for us by the likes of Akeeku and Sinóra. Find the strength in your soul and stand proud as Kásans.""

kasahistory.11.d:0 "Kása's people are taught their history through the Remembrance of Soka. It is a long and winding tale that recounts their past beginning the D'Vash slave revolt at the behest of their national hero, Akeeku Soka. They are taught not only this but it is created in the same sense as you would expect a song or poem in verse. The residents of Kása do not only know the words, but know how to sing it. Every citizen is taught this and the Remembrance of Soka is constantly having things suggested to be added to it. Only when the Council of Elders, residing in Ilha Rosca, decrees a new verse is something officially added; recent example of this was the introduction of Chapter 30 in 1003, originally written and submitted by the famed poet Áltu Kexa. While citizens are not officially required to memorize it, it is required to pass basic history schooling within the realm of Kása. It is also the best introduction for foreigners to learn Kása's history as told by the Kásans.\n\nThe history itself is only written down in a single place: on clay tablets displayed at the Grand Remembrance Hall housed inside the marooned D'Vash in Ilhas Rosca's harbour. From there it is recounted to children and adults by oral tradition. Only those who can repeat the remembrance from memory are allowed to become leaders of Kása.\n\nReader, beware, treat the Remembrance of Akeeku as a form of both history and myth. For only those present during those times know what the truth is behind this recorded history. Further more, this is a roughly translated version, understanding that it is not officially spoken nor written anywhere in Ponish. This is simply what our diplomats and translation bureau has managed to create for you to read."

### Lûa Ramedi events
luakasa.1.t:0 "Gifts from Abroad"
luakasa.1.d:0 "Certain problems were pleasant such, and the issue that had come before Lûa Ramedi was one of these. His call for the many expats and emmigrants that had left Kása to come back and aid their homeland had borne fruit beyond his wildest dreams. All estimates indicated that thousands had begun to return back to Kása, and even more had taken up sending remittances back to aid the country.\n\nYet, the most pleasant surprises had come from an unexpected source. The first was from Macawia, where a Kásan migrant had managed to found a sizeable company which specialized in electronic machines. She was offering to move the entire company over to Kása, and requested aid in the transfer. As a show of what they were able to do, she had sent over an electric typewriter, and Lûa Ramedi could not deny that the feel of the machine was exquisite.\n\nIn the other end, it turned out that a former Barrad refugee had family that fled to the River Republic instead, and who had developed a wide contact network among the republic's ponies, including several scholars that, apparently, were looking for new employment. So why then was this a problem? Simple, the budget allotted for this would not allow for both the company transfer and recruiting the scholars, meaning that the time had come to weigh the pros and cons. It was an annoyance, but it was the choice between two good things."

luakasa.2.t:0 "What is Freedom?"
luakasa.2.d:0 ""One of the defining moments of my foalhood, one that I remember even today, is when my father brought home a book. It was a gift for my mother, yet I recall looking at it in the bookshelf, wondering what had made my mother so excited. I remember asking my parents what the signs over various shops said, piecing together what these strange symbols meant, and a few days after my fifth birthday I came walking into the kitchen, holding that book, and reading the title out loud: 'Number one Manehattan Herald Bestseller. A Forbidden Flame.'\n\nIt took me a long time to understand just why I was given cake on the condition that I never spoke of that book again, yet something about that stuck with me. Being able to read had given me cake, and if that was the case, what could I not gain from the countless other skills that education offered? Let this anecdote stand as evidence that I stand here not as some singular genius, but as a regular zebra who had the opportunities, and were motivated by interest far beyond anycreature's control. I wanted cake, later on I had good teachers who could nurture my growth, and then the joy instilled in me carried me through my education, and later employment, and in the end to this position.\n\nI do not plan to make any claims of being exceptional, the opposite, and I want to ask you this. What would a nation where everycreature could have the opportunities I had be like? Disregarding the brilliant minds of our academies, what of those trapped on their farms, or in the slums, or in a refugee camp, too starved to even think properly? How much is wasted simply because the ambitious, the driven, those who would have been the first to rise up alongside Akeeku himself, yet now find themselves trapped in a world where the answers are not as obvious?\n\nBreaking the chains is all well and good, but he who does not know the world around him, is forever in bondage. The challenges of Kása today lies not in a desperate revolt, but in education and training. The world is changing more and more, and we must equip out people to be ready for the world that awaits them. We do this not by firebrand speeches or valiant last stands, but by patient education and ceaseless improvement. We should raise not only freedom fighters, but engineers and scientists as well, and the quill is our weapon more than the sword ever was in this struggle.""

I cannot for the life of me recall where, precisely, I read this quote, or whether I have simply conjured it myself from faint memories and a desire to recall it as poignant, yet the gist of it was that philosophy concerns itself with what is true, and politics - if executed properly and under just leadership - is about implementing what is true onto the world.\n\nOne of the effects of this state of affairs, is that blind dogmatism by definition is cripped: it offers one answer, no matter the context. Conversely, a sober and sometimes dispassionate assessment of the state of affairs has been and will remain the best tool of any leader. As it stands, one of the key assessments to be made is this: there has never been as many challengers for the position of First Commander as there were in the past election. This is an unavoidable fact, yet what does it mean?\n\nIt means - I maintain - that the Kása of today is not the Kása declared by Sinora Pon, nor the Kása that my honored predecessor assumed leadership of. In prosperity, there has been change, and while desperate times call for the exceptional among us to assume leadership, prosperity and progress allows for the slower growing talents to be nurtured.\n\nWe all know the famous "potato decree", where Sinora Pon made the choice regarding Kása's central crop. It was not so that Kása would forever rely on potatoes, it was so that in those times of famine, Kása would have a reliable crop which could provide for us all. None would claim we are failing Kása by growing carrots, or lettuce, or apples. It is merely that in times of plenty, we can afford greater variety. I maintain that the same holds true in regards to leadership.\n\nMore and more Kásans stand tall enough to be a worthy first commander - I stood against three others who each would have led the nation well - and the more our nation prospers, the more this number will grow. For this reason, the time has come to rethink my position. The role of First Commander, that served us so well, is becoming more and more unsuited for a maturing Kása, one filled with informed, driven and able creatures who every day prove themselves not only able but willing to have a say in their fate. For this reason, Kása must reform. For this reason, the time has come to democratize her.""

luakasa.4.t:0 "What is Wealth?"
luakasa.4.d:0 ""As the Prudutu Projektu continues on, we are seeing not just a progress, but something much deeper, something that shows why this era has in Griffonia and Equus been called "the industrial revolution". The very conditions of our society are changing, and the things that once made some among us wealthy has come to fade into the background, forcing the old guard to compete in a new type of economical game.\n\nWhat is particularly obvious is the fact that with this progress our society has become more tightly linked than ever before, and that conditions for our people are changing fundamentally. This includes their economic conditions, and what once served them well is now found wanting. There was a time where giving the refugees crossing the border food, blankets and in the end a small patch of land to live off served them well, yet this is no longer the case.\n\nEconomists would speak of us transitioning from an agrarian to an industrial economy, and that patch of land might have provided food, but it does not provide money. It does not buy the foals clothes to wear to school - indeed school might become an issue when every hoof is needed on the farm. It does not provide for the comforts of modern life, nor does  it offer much in the way of options to better one's station in life.\n\nTo this end, it is imperative that new answers are offered by the Kásan government. When the majority of our people do not work their own land, but instead have taken employment for various companies, are we to leave them at the whims of their employers, who by necessity must be concerned with the bottom line? In an era where trade deals grow and become even more complex, can we truly rely on individual actors working on our behalf instead of uniting our efforts under one central trading authority?\n\nThese questions and more will need to be addressed, and the answers provided by the government will have to be such that they enrich the average Kásan. If Kása advances as a nation but leaves it people behind, then it is doomed to fail in the end.""

luakasa.5.t:0 "Rainy Dedication"
luakasa.5.d:0 ""Too many times, Kása has been pushed to the brink, and as many times, she has seen heroes rise to the cause, ready to fight to the bitter end." Lûa Ramedi read solemnly from the speech, standing under the cover of the umbrella in the pouring rain. The crowd in front of him were silent, listening reverently to him. The monument - a monument to the heroes of Kása - had taken months to finish. "We owe these heroes our prosperity, our freedom and our very nation" Lûa Ramedi continued, "Though our words
