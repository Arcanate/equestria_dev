 FEZ_riad_smugglers_desc:0 "Even with the most incriminating evidence, we cannot formally arrest the city council, as they are protected by the "law".

 #Focuses
 ##Dirty Smugglers
 FEZ_evil:0 "Clandestine Practices"
 FEZ_evil_desc:0 "Any effort to solve the crime problem in Fezara will end in a failure. Better to embrace the dark side of life than to fight in vain."
 FEZ_smugglers:0 ""Honest" Businessgriffs"
 FEZ_smugglers_desc:0 "The Fezeran City Council are the legitimate, honest representatives of the Fezzerian griffons. They would never lie to you, and neither are they secretly smugglers exploiting the country for their own good. Trust us, the polls are all in our favour."
 FEZ_no_cops:0 "Tackling the Obstacle"
 FEZ_no_cops_desc:0 "Those coppers have been putting a dent in our profit margins for years. It's time to get rid of them, permanently. We are prepared to handle the resulting fallout, it is but a minor setback for our grand plans."
 FEZ_criminal_jobs:0 "A New Type of Job"
 FEZ_criminal_jobs_desc:0 "Alright, so the mess caused by removing the only honest law enforcement in the city has been bigger than we expected. It's time to step in and distract the populace with promises of easy, good paying work. The legitimacy of these jobs won't be morally pure, however."
 FEZ_mercenary_cops:0 "Private Police Force"
 FEZ_mercenary_cops_desc:0 "Truth is, a city simply cannot operate without somegriffs to keep the daily order. We'll remake the police department, but filled with entirely our own griffons, who will answer only to us. They'll keep the riff raff at ease while turning a blind eye to our criminal operations."
 FEZ_bootleg_beer:0 "Moonshine!"
 FEZ_bootleg_beer_desc:0 "When times are hard, there's nothing more enjoyable than a bottle of finest Skyfall alcohol. We shall take advantage of this brand recognition by brewing our own cheap swill, and bottling it into the famous Skyfall casing. Who can tell the difference? And to show we're the good guys, we'll distribute free samples to our workers."
 FEZ_cash_crop:0 "Quick Returns"
 FEZ_cash_crop_desc:0 "Our country's small population means we don't need to devote as much land for farmsteads compared to other nations. As such, we can take advantage of this free farmland to plant various cash crops like tobacco, coffee beans and cotton. They'll also require factories to process them into finished goods, ready for selling."
 FEZ_weapons_for_trade:0 "Firearms for Money"
 FEZ_weapons_for_trade_desc:0 "Wars sporadically occur across Griffonia, and they all have one thing in common: they're in need of guns. We shall put some of our honest earnings into constructing factories for the production firearms, and while we'll keep a small portion for our defence, most will go into the underground black markets, where we'll make a killing!"
 FEZ_search_for_trade_partners:0 "Foreign Trade"
 FEZ_search_for_trade_partners_desc:0 "Now that we got the goods griffons want, it's time to start searching for reliable trade partners. Look to our neighbours first, we need to cut off Skyfall's income wherever we can."
 FEZ_trade_prep:0 "Hire Foreign Workforce"
 FEZ_trade_prep_desc:0 "In order to handle the increased production of goods we're planning to output, we'll need a lot more helping claws than we currently have. Place some contracts for work on a fixed time, we'll even pay them good for a change. This time, it will be worth it."
 FEZ_black_market_start:0 "Open For Business!"
 FEZ_black_market_start_desc:0 "Good work, one and all. We've shown that we don't need those good for nothing cops, with living standards slowly increasing due to our various trade schemes. Sure, most of this wealth is concentrated in our claws, but we make sure to throw the peasants a bit or two every now and then. Can anygriff say we're the bad guys here? We think not."
 FEZ_steal_smart_birbs:0 "A Solution for Illiteracy"
 FEZ_steal_smart_birbs_desc:0 "Now it's true that the griffons in Fezera are a notch above the rest, but we can't say we have many... truly intelligent ones. The ones that can think of shiny new things to change our lives! The solution for this problem? We'll abduct eggheads from abroad. They can work for us or get the bullet."
 FEZ_make_laboratory:0 "Testing Grounds"
 FEZ_make_laboratory_desc:0 "To create wonderful new inventions, we need large, empty spaces for testing. It's a good thing we've got many warehouses to store our smuggled goods. We can repurpose some of these for the eggheads, provided that they return with good results in the next 6 months or less."
 FEZ_skyfall_problem:0 "The Concern About Skyfall"
 FEZ_skyfall_problem_desc:0 "Those stiff necked griffons in Skyfall never had any respect for us, with their "trade councils" and "quality assurances". Bunch of nonsense, only interferes in obtaining profit. It's time to begin plotting their downfall, and claim their riches for ourselves."
 FEZ_skyfall_sabotage:0 "Ruthless Sabotage"
 FEZ_skyfall_sabotage_desc:0 "To even the odds against Skyfall, we shall conduct raids on their territory. The priority will be damaging the industrial and naval production centres, stealing plunder is secondary. It could very well make the difference."
 FEZ_persuade_griefwald:0 "Convince Greifwald"
 FEZ_persuade_griefwald_desc:0 "Skyfall is weak, yes, but we'd have a much better chance of winning if we were convince our neighbours in Greifwald to support us. Their famous approach to neutrality surely doesn't apply to Skyfall, right? We'll fabricate some reason to invade otherwise."
 FEZ_prepare_war:0 "Rally the Mercenaries"
 FEZ_prepare_war_desc:0 "In a small country like Fezera, there are hardly any professional soldiers. This doesn't bode well for our plans, but we shall make up for this deficit by hiring mercenaries and conscripting willing citizens."
 FEZ_griefwald_ally:0 "A Second Front"
 FEZ_griefwald_ally_desc:0 "Now that the birds in Greifwald have agreed to support us, it is time to formalise our alliance on paper. Hopefully, they won't realise what they've signed up for..."
 FEZ_more_factories:0 "Additional Firearm Production"
 FEZ_more_factories_desc:0 "Guns, we need more guns. We can't spare money to buy some at the moment, so we shall instead improve our current production centres and expand the workshops. Each firearm will make a difference in the war to come."
 FEZ_skyfall_war:0 "End the Trade Federation"
 FEZ_skyfall_war_desc:0 "We've got our weapons, our allies and our mercenaries ready and waiting. It is time to pull off the biggest heist in history. Mayor Godard is eager to take to claim the largest villa in the city of Skyfall for himself, with a scenic view on the bustling ports. Onwards!"
 FEZ_approach_aqulia:0 "Trick the Aquileians"
 FEZ_approach_aqulia_desc:0 "We've done it, Skyfall is ours. While we are eager to expand our money making operations, first we must secure ourselves against an invasion. We shall approach the Aquileians in hopes of obtaining their protection. We'll present ourselves as innocent, peace loving griffons who fought against their oppressors in Skyfall... They'll buy it up, guaranteed! Make sure it seems honest..."
 FEZ_expanding_market:0 "The World Beyond"
 FEZ_expanding_market_desc:0 "Now that we've got Skyfall in our claws, the world is our oyster! We shall expand our operations across entire Griffonia, and maybe even beyond! By pretending to be the legitimate successor of Skyfall, we'll get access to exclusive trade contracts, which we'll put to good use. Namely, to swindle the world!"
 
 
 ##The Classy Mobsters
 FEZ_siding_maf:0 "De Familie"
 FEZ_siding_maf_desc:0 "The boss is tired of those scammers in the city hall giving Fezera a bad reputation. Now we aren't blind, we're not fit either to walk guilt-free, but the main difference is that we care about the people. With the Politie out of commission, we can step up and assume control."
 FEZ_corrupt_cops:0 "Not So Different"
 FEZ_corrupt_cops_desc:0 "We sympathize with the policegriffs. All they wanted to do it keep Fezera a safe place to live in. We shall approach their remnants and offer them a deal they won't be able to refuse."
 FEZ_family_first:0 "Strengthen the Family"
 FEZ_family_first_desc:0 "We need griffons in every aspect of Fezerrian managment. Nothing can happen in this city anymore without our involvement. That includes all the coin being made and lost, as well."
 FEZ_loose_ends:0 "Eliminating the Competition"
 FEZ_loose_ends_desc:0 "Our takeover has been remarkably smooth. However, there are still a plenty of birds in Fezera that require a whacking. The boss needs to rule uncontested to achieve his goals."
 FEZ_expand_family:0 "New Blood"
 FEZ_expand_family_desc:0 "With our control secured, we can now spread the word across western Griffonia. Fezera is a place where anygriff who fought the law can lay low and never get pinched. As an additional benefit, some of them might even join our Familie fully."
 FEZ_invite_criminals_to_family:0 "Recruitment"
 FEZ_invite_criminals_to_family_desc:0 "The influx of various gentlegriffs over the past months has resulted, as expected, into willing recruits for our organisation. The boss is pleased with the numbers, the books are open."
 FEZ_protect_scientists:0 "Watch the Eggheads"
 FEZ_protect_scientists_desc:0 "Fezera can reasonably be called a city of smart griffons. Intelligent birds means progress, and progress means better guns and more loot. Make sure the eggheads have everything they need to come up with new technologies and advancements."
 FEZ_ludicrous_buisness:0 "Sharing Our Success"
 FEZ_ludicrous_buisness_desc:0 "Now that all pieces are in place, we can initiate our honest trading schemes. We got plenty to sell! Additionally, a cut of each sale will go to the poor griffons of Fezera, so that they can stand up for themselves. We want everygriff living in Fezera to be decent."
 FEZ_more_tobacco:0 "A Better Brand"
 FEZ_more_tobacco_desc:0 "Skyfall is famous for their various excellent tobacco brands. We shall take advantage of this, and copy their success! Perhaps an improvement is in order, as well..."
 FEZ_more_boos:0 "Wonderful Liquor"
 FEZ_more_boos_desc:0 "As part of our operations, we've been producing illegal alcohol in underground distilleries. No need to hide anymore! Some of our factories will now be repurposed to exclusively produce liquor. To attract workers, we'll give them each a free sample of the merchandise."
 FEZ_more_tommy_guns:0 "A Means of Protection"
 FEZ_more_tommy_guns_desc:0 "You can get much further with a kind word and a gun than you can with just a kind word, it is known. Everygriff in the Familie needs to know this. But first, we're going to need more weapon factories."
 FEZ_skyfall_blockade:0 "Block the Skyfall Ports"
 FEZ_skyfall_blockade_desc:0 "After extensive consultation with the other high ranking members of the Familie, the boss has decided that we're going to take over Skyfall. They got the goods, the money, they got it all. We shall begin by hampering their trade routes."
 FEZ_mafia_way:0 "The Fezeran Customs"
 FEZ_mafia_way_desc:0 "We're familiar with every inch of our country. This will become crucial in the upcoming fight. Bait the attackers right where we want them to be, then whack them."
 FEZ_rally_family:0 "Prepare the Family"
 FEZ_rally_family_desc:0 "The mobsters are great shots, no doubt, but they lack cohesion to fight as a proper army. We need to organise our griffons into units and battalions, in order to have a chance at victory."
 FEZ_prepar_boarder:0 "Healthy Worries"
 FEZ_prepar_boarder_desc:0 "Skyfall's army is better equipped and more numerous than ours. We shall appear weaker than we are, giving away the control of the border, only to lure the overconfident fools into our fortifications. A veritable deathtrap will await."
 FEZ_tommy_guns_for_all:0 "Our Little Friends"
 FEZ_tommy_guns_for_all_desc:0 ""Should anygriff decide to mess with us, they shall receive a warm welcome from our little friends. Ensure every member of the Familie owns one.""
 FEZ_dons_men:0 "The Boss' Way"
 FEZ_dons_men_desc:0 "Although the boss has never had any actual military training, he knows better than all of us how to lead a fighting force. We trust him implicitly."
 FEZ_skyfall_strikes:0 "Expanding Our Territory"
 FEZ_skyfall_strikes_desc:0 ""Boss says we're ready. Either we dine in Skyfall by the next week, or we're sleeping with the fishes in the docks of Featherzne. Griffons, march!""
 FEZ_mafia_skyfall:0 "Putting Skyfall to Good Use"
 FEZ_mafia_skyfall_desc:0 "With the city of Skyfall in our claws, its famous ports and ships are ours to command. And we know just the thing to do - sell our merchandise across the entire world! Riches will flow in, sooner than one can imagine."
 FEZ_attack_haukland:0 "A Safe Haven Between the Continents"
 FEZ_attack_haukland_desc:0 "The boss has been eyeing the Hauklands archipelago for some time. He thinks they'd make a great Summertime resort, and a place to retreat should things go sour on the mainland. Not to mention, it's a safe place to store our treasures. As soon as those ships are ready, we're going to pay Meyer a visit."
 FEZ_marry_wng_maf:0 "Align With the Wingbardian Family"
 FEZ_marry_wng_maf_desc:0 "The Wingbardian Mafia is the single largest organised crime syndicate across the entire continent. Even failed states that are run by bandits aren't as wealthy and influential like them! The boss wants to make a mutually beneficial offer with them. They get a cut from the Skyfall trading, we get their protection."
 FEZ_go_alone:0 "Our Own Path"
 FEZ_go_alone_desc:0 "We've done pretty good for ourselves, and nobody can deny that. Why make allies when we're doing great on our own? The boss has declared: we eat alone. Still, we'd be wise to prepare for an eventual foreign incursion. Skyfall is coveted by many on the continent..."
 
 ##Good Cops
 FEZ_good:0 "A Just and Honourable Cause"

 FEZ_recruit_last_cadets:0 "Volunteers for Righteousness"
 FEZ_recruit_last_cadets_desc:0 "We've mourned for our fallen policegriffs long enough, it's time to hire new ones to carry the torch of justice. There are plenty of griffons in Fezera who do not like being ruled by crooks and bandits, and we shall capitalise on this."
 FEZ_asking_for_help:0 "Feathisian Assistance"
 FEZ_asking_for_help_desc:0 "Training new cadets would go a lot smoother if we had enough equipment for all of them. The clandestine elements in this country control much of the production centres, which means our means of resupplying are very limited. Chief Pasvogel has decided to send a plea to Feathisia, he's certain they will understand our cause."
 FEZ_insipire_pd:0 "Crusade Against Crime"
 FEZ_insipire_pd_desc:0 "It must be clear at all times what we fight for. A lawful society where every griffon can live in peace and prosperity, without fear of being extorted. Remind the griffons what is our cause."

 FEZ_do_it_by_the_book_desc:0 "It cannot be stressed how important it is to do everything by the book. We shall bring the lawbreakers to justice, but we shall never compromise on our ideals. We shall never stoop so low to become like them. Otherwise, our cause is hollow and the good people of Fezera will not trust us."
 FEZ_hunt_corruption:0 "Root Out Corruption"
 FEZ_hunt_corruption_desc:0 "There is corruption at seemingly every aspect of our society - industry, the militia command, the Fezeran University and even the city council itself. That much has been very clear to everygriff for years - yet nogriff has done anything about it. It is time to enact justice on these horrid enablers of corruption."
 FEZ_start_raids:0 "Strike the Criminal Holds"
 FEZ_start_raids_desc:0 "The Fezeraanse Politie is ready to remove the sinful element from our society. There's no doubt it will be a tough battle - the thugs have many hideouts and even more griffons - but with justice and law on our side, we'll end their operations once and for all. And remember, do it by the book."
 FEZ_rally_public:0 "The Public Opinion"
 FEZ_rally_public_desc:0 "The commonfolk must know of our cause! For years, the thieves have been conducting a campaign of public relations to paint themselves in a good light, while we're the oppressors. No more! The public must know everything! Expose every scrap of their real intentions!"
 FEZ_defeat_of_maf:0 "Prison for the Family"
 FEZ_defeat_of_maf_desc:0 "We've caught all of the Penose family leaders, with Don Holveder found hiding in his villa. With the leaders captured, the mobsters have fractured and become disorganised. They shall receive a fair and just trial - although there's no doubt most of them will spend a very long time behind bars."
 FEZ_defeat_of_smugglers:0 "End of the Smuggling Operations"
 FEZ_defeat_of_smugglers_desc:0 "We've busted "Mayor" Godard and almost half of the city council trying to escape to Haukland with a fast ship. They shall return every bit they scammed from the people!"
 FEZ_take_control_of_country:0 "Restoration of Order"
 FEZ_take_control_of_country_desc:0 "With the culpable elements in Fezera defeated, a power vacuum has sprung up. We can now finally step up and begin improving Fezera. To the detractors who believe we'll become the next dictators, we say to look at the law, and remember that we are accountable to the people."
 FEZ_safter_place:0 "A Safe Country"
 FEZ_safter_place_desc:0 "Already, Fezera feels like a better, different place. The griffons conduct their daily business freely, and overall, Fezera is set to become a land free of fear. Thus, we shall encourage immigration to our beautiful town, as long as they pay respects to the law."
 FEZ_reopen_skoolz:0 "Reopen the Places of Learning"
 FEZ_reopen_skoolz_desc:0 "While illiteracy has never been a serious problem in Fezera, the truth remains that most griffons did not receive more than the most basic of education. Thus, we shall open new schools and expand the current faculties, so that everygriff can be properly knowledgeable."
 FEZ_more_factory_jobs:0 "Employment for the People"
 FEZ_more_factory_jobs_desc:0 "The common griffon could hardly find decent work before, as the most important positions were filled by felons, who only hired their friends and family. Nepotism and cronyism shall no longer occur in Fezera, and everygriffon shall have a fair chance at finding work. We expect production to bloom as a result."
 FEZ_better_trains:0 "A New Railroad"
 FEZ_better_trains_desc:0 "We may be a country dominated by a single large city, but it doesn't mean that the countryside should be left underdeveloped. To begin correcting this, a railroad will be constructed, connecting every major settlement of the land."
 FEZ_reopen_academy:0 "Fezeran Police Academy"
 FEZ_reopen_academy_desc:0 "The Fezeran Police Academy is a prestigious location in which all policegriffs received their proper training - or they would have, were it not for all budget cuts we received under the rule of "Mayor" Godard. Now that we control where the bits go, it shall regain its splendour."
 FEZ_stronger_than_ever:0 "Peace and Harmony"
 FEZ_stronger_than_ever_desc:0 "Law and order have been restored to Fezera. The griffons no longer face extortion or unjust taxation, and the Fezeraanse Politie has been brought back to its full strength. The people are convinced by our reforms, and they fully trust and cooperate with us. Good work, everygriffon!"
 FEZ_hunt_evil:0 "Hunting Down the Stragglers"
 FEZ_hunt_evil_desc:0 "Despite our victories, there are still some griffons who threathen the prosperity of our fair city. The amount of crimes reported has been rather low, but that doesn't mean we can rest. No, the criminal element cannot be allowed to persist, lest it becomes a widespread problem again."
 FEZ_war_prep:0 "Prepare for War"
 FEZ_war_prep_desc:0 "With our internal matters settled, we've begun to observe the situation in our neighbours and Griffonia at large. We believe that our current forces are insufficient to properly handle an external incursion, and so we shall expand our ranks."
 FEZ_special_academy:0 "First Graduates"
 FEZ_special_academy_desc:0 "The accelerated course at the academy has already produced results! Two morally upstanding griffons have completed their assignments in record time, and are ready to command our forces."
 FEZ_war_with_evil:0 "Strike at the Source"
 FEZ_war_with_evil_desc:0 "Our thorough investigation has been concluded. Almost every major nefarious issue, past and current, can be traced back to Skyfall. Whether they were complicit in this is irrelevant - we shall demand that they allow us to conduct an investigation on their territory, or otherwise we'll have to take control of the land."
 FEZ_ally_aqulia:0 "Friendship with Aquileia"
 FEZ_ally_aqulia_desc:0 "The griffons of Aquileia are some of the most fervent supporters of Harmony on the continent, and we should aim towards establishing an alliance with them. This way, our safety will be forever ensured, and we focus exclusively on keeping to our internal matters."
 FEZ_ally_republic:0 "The Republican Cause"
 FEZ_ally_republic_desc:0 "Marshal Kemerskai is a staunch supporter of democracy and justice, having fought for years against tyranny and malefactors, and is the natural choice for our protector. Surely, when he sees how upright our society is, he'll accept our request for protection? We certainly hope so."
 
 ##Army
 FEZ_army_start:0 "Establish the Fezzerian Forces"
 FEZ_army_start_desc:0 "Since Fezera declared independence, its armed forces have been nothing more than a glorified city guard, unsuitable for anything more than defending the streets and chasing away lost animals. As our place in the world is becoming more and more apparent, we've decided to correct this issue, and establish a proper land force."
 FEZ_expand_army:0 "Expand the Recruitment Quotas"
 FEZ_expand_army_desc:0 "At the current moment, the city guard is comprised of mostly volunteers. Reasonable for a small city-state, but if we wish to expand our influence in the world, the number of recruits must rise. Our recruiters shall start a grand recruitment drive, to attract even more volunteers."
 FEZ_mobile_start:0 "De Nieuwe Steunpilaar"
 FEZ_mobile_start_desc:0 "As seen in the recent wars, mobility and armoured vehicles are the future of warfare. With some effort, we can transform our army into a highly mobile strike force, ending the battle before it even begins."
 FEZ_motrized:0 "An Army on Wheels"
 FEZ_motrized_desc:0 "The idea of using trucks and automobiles to carry troops and supplies is not widespread in Fezera. If we desire to have a mobile army, we need to design our own transportation vehicle and train troops in its most efficient usage."
 FEZ_tanks:0 "Light Tank Experiments"
 FEZ_tanks_desc:0 "The quintessential armoured vehicle is a quick one - able to shrug off small arms fire and secure objectives while the remainder of the army cleans up stragglers. This shall be our primary tactic."
 FEZ_bigger_tanks:0 "Improved Armoured Vehicles"
 FEZ_bigger_tanks_desc:0 "Initial tests with our light tank models has been successful, but our generals feel that a more heavily armoured vehicle that does not sacrifice too much on speed would be better suited for leading the vanguard. Luckily, we have just the designs for those ready and waiting for approval."
 FEZ_mobile_doctrine2:0 "Improving Our Doctrine"
 FEZ_mobile_doctrine2_desc:0 "Our strategies, training and tactics could always use improvement. If we cannot come up with our own ideas on how to do that, then we shall employ foreign designs. We must not fall behind in military thinking."
 FEZ_better_tank_factories:0 "Streamlined Tank Production"
 FEZ_better_tank_factories_desc:0 "We've done our best to drag ourselves into the forefront of modern warfare. While the troops can still benefit from more training, already we reap the benefits - our workers are producing tanks and trucks much more efficiently."
 FEZ_superior_start:0 "Vertrouw Op Artillerie"
 FEZ_superior_start_desc:0 "Fezeran industry is too small to support a large motorised force. Instead, we shall continue trusting in the old reliables - rifles and shells to blast away our foes."
 FEZ_bigger_guns:0 "Replace the Rusty Guns"
 FEZ_bigger_guns_desc:0 "Our artillery pieces are little more than leftovers from Skyfall, or were obtained from suspicious sources. Efforts shall be placed in obtaining the newest models."
 FEZ_special_forces:0 "Special Forces"
 FEZ_special_forces_desc:0 "Regular infantry performs their job admirably, but for the most difficult situations, we're going to need to establish an elite fighting force to handle these special missions."
 FEZ_better_weapons:0 "Improving Our Soldiers' Equipment"
 FEZ_better_weapons_desc:0 "A quick examination of our rifles shows that they're woefully outdated. Same goes for our support equipment - it is a priority to bring them to contemporary standards."
 FEZ_superior_doctrine2:0 "Perfecting Our Strategy"
 FEZ_superior_doctrine2_desc:0 "In order to maximise the firepower of our army, the troops must be trained better in coordinating with each other, and our generals and officers need to be aware of every tactic at their disposal."
 FEZ_hardened_troops:0 "A Proud Elite"
 FEZ_hardened_troops_desc:0 "We've come a long way from our humble beginnings, but the Fezzerian soldier is now a proud warrior, willing to push himself to the limit in service to his country. Meanwhile, the ordnance factories have perfected their casting methods, producing a higher amount of heavy weaponry. Fezera shall never fall!"
 
 #Airforce
 FEZ_air_start:0 "Claws in the Sky"
 FEZ_air_start_desc:0 "The ever changing aspect of warfare requires us to continuously adapt and overcome any obstacles. Airplanes have been making great progress in the past decade, and we find ourselves lacking any of them to defend our skies. This changes now, with the establishment of the Fezzerian Air Force."
 FEZ_new_airports:0 "New Plane Hangars"
 FEZ_new_airports_desc:0 "Before we could even think about putting our planes to use, we must first construct hangars and airfields for their usage. Fezera has many empty fields, thus we're not lacking in space for them."
 FEZ_air_doctrine_start:0 "Choosing Our Approach"
 FEZ_air_doctrine_start_desc:0 "The way our pilots operate is part of a larger strategy, not something to be chosen randomly. We must choose a suitable doctrine for our airforce and its future composition."
 FEZ_fighters:0 "Procure Fighter Designs"
 FEZ_fighters_desc:0 "The role of airplanes is best suited for directly supporting our troops in the field. The airforce will be tied to their performance, and the first step is to find a suitable fighter design. Our more developed neighbours will be more than happy to sell us one of their dated models."
 FEZ_heavy_fighters:0 "Sky Fortresses"
 FEZ_heavy_fighters_desc:0 "Our current fighter designs are not durable enough, nor do they have sufficient range for some of our more demanding missions. A new prototype will be developed, carrying higher firepower as well."
 FEZ_air_doctrine_f:0 "The Way We Fight"
 FEZ_air_doctrine_f_desc:0 "Cooperation between airplanes is a requirement if we desire to maximise their performance. They should make use of every resource and tactic in the book to perform optimally."
 FEZ_cas:0 "Close and Personal"
 FEZ_cas_desc:0 "A specialised plane is required to directly support our troops in the field, but one that does not carry the drawbacks of bombers. By modifying our fighters, we can develop a slower, but more devastating close support plane."
 FEZ_fighter_doctrine:0 "Fighter Formations"
 FEZ_fighter_doctrine_desc:0 "Additional training is required to improve the coordination and effectiveness of the ground forces and pilots. Performance in the field is lacking, and we require better results."
 FEZ_bombers:0 "Develop a Bomber Model"
 FEZ_bombers_desc:0 "We shall bomb our foes to dust - whether it is their troops, their fortifications or their cities - we shall never relent until there is nothing left! But to achieve this grand design, we require an airplane to carry this explosive payload."
 FEZ_bomber_doctrine:0 "Bomber Tactics"
 FEZ_bomber_doctrine_desc:0 "Our nascent bomber squadrons require improved training, in order to perform effectively. There is more to them than just piloting an airplane and dropping bombs."
 FEZ_naval_bombers:0 "Bomb the Seas"
 FEZ_naval_bombers_desc:0 "Warships, despite carrying anti-air batteries, are still vulnerable to attacks from the skies, if they are not supported by their airplanes. We shall take advantage of this by developing a bomber model intended exclusively for missions at sea."
 FEZ_bomber_doctrine2:0 "Bombs Away!"
 FEZ_bomber_doctrine2_desc:0 "The bomber pilots have been returning with better results, but they must still learn how to coordinate with their escorts, as well as develop methods to perfect their timing of payload release."
 FEZ_strat_bombers:0 "Their Most Vulnerable Target"
 FEZ_strat_bombers_desc:0 "Without their industrial production, the forces of our foes will soon disintegrate. Although none of our current bomber models have the range, payload or armour to carry out such a dangerous mission, this will change soon."
 FEZ_air_production:0 "Optimised Airplane Production"
 FEZ_air_production_desc:0 "Our extensive focus on airplane research and development has given us great insight on how to reduce production costs. Soon enough, every pilot in Fezera will have his own plane, and a reserve as well!"
 
 ##Boring Navy, sorry Captain
 FEZ_naval_start:0 "The Vast Ocean"
 FEZ_naval_start_desc:0 "While Fezera can claim to be somewhat influential in naval trade, it is nothing compared to our neighbours in Skyfall. This situation must change, immediately. We must have a warfleet to protect our trade."
 FEZ_large_fleet:0 "A Grand Proposal for the Fleet"
 FEZ_large_fleet_desc:0 "Fezera shall rule the waves! A grand fleet to match the glorious Imperial fleet of old shall be designed, built, and led by our finest naval strategist."
 FEZ_small_fleet:0 "A Realistic Proposal for the Fleet"
 FEZ_small_fleet_desc:0 "Unfortunately, Fezera cannot hope to construct any sort of large fleet for a very long time. Instead, we shall continue depending on fast cruisers to waylay enemy ships, and produce submarines to sink our enemies' trade convoys."
 FEZ_battleship:0 "Battleship Designs"
 FEZ_battleship_desc:0 "What we require is a grand warship. One that puts every other naval vessel to shame! A sturdy battleship, even a lonesome, will ensure our dominance at seas."
 FEZ_battleship_doctrine1:0 "A Fleet in Being"
 FEZ_battleship_doctrine1_desc:0 "Coordinating multiple warships to stay in formation is a serious effort that requires proper training on the seagriffs' part. Not to mention, the ship's captains will require an extensive amount of time spent on choosing their strategy! The payoffs will be worthwhile, however."
 FEZ_aircraft_carrier:0 "Carrier Ship Blueprints"
 FEZ_aircraft_carrier_desc:0 "Carriers and carrier based planes are set to become crucial in the future of naval warfare, and we believe having some of our own would complement well our battleships."
 FEZ_battleship_doctrine2:0 "Dominate the Seas"
 FEZ_battleship_doctrine2_desc:0 "Excellent work is being done on improving our fleet's capabilities, but we can always improve our tactics. We shall study our potential foes' doctrines and adapt to them accordingly."
 FEZ_battle_cruiser:0 "Armoured Cruisers"
 FEZ_battle_cruiser_desc:0 "Although we cannot field a fleet comprised fully of battleships due to multiple reasons, we can instead modify our heavy ship hulls to carry less weight, while preserving its firepower and speed."
 FEZ_submaries:0 "Import Submarine Models"
 FEZ_submaries_desc:0 "Our initial attempts to produce our own submarine have resulted in a failure. We're lucky that nobody drowned when the prototype sunk! We've decided it would be more feasible to look to our neighbours for a reliable model. If they will not provide one, we'll have to make contact with distant shapeshifting creatures..."
 FEZ_submarine_doctrine1:0 "Convoy Interception"
 FEZ_submarine_doctrine1_desc:0 "As our fleet is insufficient to properly battle other, much stronger fleets on the high seas, we will focus on efforts on sinking their more vulnerable targets. A war of attrition, as it is."
 FEZ_submarine_doctrine2:0 "Starving Our Foes"
 FEZ_submarine_doctrine2_desc:0 "The submarines shall operate every day of the week, regardless of the hour - we shall not relent until the enemy is depleted of their supplies and resources. This will force their surrender."
 FEZ_cruisers:0 "Fast Raiders"
 FEZ_cruisers_desc:0 "The ever reliable cruiser is a key part of our fleet. Quick, but carrying sufficient firepower, they can compete with the heavy ships with proper tactics. Still, our aging designs require an update."
 FEZ_heavy_cruisers:0 "Quick and Dangerous"
 FEZ_heavy_cruisers_desc:0 "A natural progression from our light cruisers, the heavy cruiser shall carry a far greater amount of guns and armour. Existing ships will be retrofitted with the new modifications."
 FEZ_dockyards:0 "Expand Our Naval Production"
 FEZ_dockyards_desc:0 "Our existing ports and shipyards are incapable of handling the increased demand by our increased naval spending. We require an expansion of our naval facilities, if we wish to maintain our fleet."
 FEZ_better_landingcraft:0 "Safe Landings"
 FEZ_better_landingcraft_desc:0 "Naval invasions are some of the most dangerous and complex operations we can put into action, and casualty rates are high as the troops scramble to secure the objectives. We've thought of several ideas to improve the chances of our forces making it to the landing zone, starting with our transport ships."
 FEZ_aquatic_fighters:0 "Fezeran Marines"
 FEZ_aquatic_fighters_desc:0 "Victory at sea is a prerequisite for a successful naval invasion - and we believe it would be best to train a specialised force dedicated to amphibious warfare. They shall be the first to take steps on the enemies' shores."

 #Events
 fezera.100.t:0 "A Daring Raid"
 fezera.100.d:0 "During the cold night, the seedy underbelly of Fezera did not slumber. For weeks now they had prepared for this, a bold strike at the heart of their bitter foe: Fezeraanse Politie, the law enforcement agency of Fezera. For years now they had been a thorn on their side, refusing to let them operate in peace and hurting their profit margins. Many bosses had been arrested, shipments seized and illegal operations unveiled. The time had come for payback.\n\nThe criminals struck suddenly, all at once across the city. The police department of every precinct was targeted, with griffons carrying weapons smuggled from abroad. Fires were set and explosives thrown, with policegriffs on night shift being caught by surprise and shot without mercy. Those that managed to hide called for reinforcements and woke up their comrades who rushed to action.\n\nFlames spread and sirens echoed in the darkness of the night as law and crime clashed. As the sun rose on an ash-covered city, the end result of the fighting was clear for all to see."
