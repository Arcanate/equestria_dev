############ MAIN TREE
######## Not Faction related
DED_Council:0 "The Dread Council's Decision"
DED_Council_desc:0 "The time has come once again to chose a leader for the current Dread League. Rosa Maledicta is the most promising candidate for this position. She has an ambition that matches her proficiency in dark magic."

DED_Army_Dead:0 "The Army of Dread"
DED_Army_Dead_desc:0 "Every army needs leaders. We should look into gathering the best tactical minds of the Dread League, their combined experience and their leadership qualities will serve us well in the coming years."

DED_Prep_Crusade:0 "Prepare for the Dark Crusade"
DED_Prep_Crusade_desc:0 "My Queen, the Arcturian Order has persecuted us for years now. You may desire to manouver the Dread League into the position of waging war with those vile WORHSIPERS OF THE LIGHT? and bring an end to the reign of their petty order."

DED_Unquiet:0 "No Rest for the Undead"
DED_Unquiet_desc:0 "The Magehold is the main gathering for the denizens of the Dread League. This presents an opportunity to put some of its inhabitants to use. Manufactures  will be built to provide for the requirements of Rosa and her armies. Plans for these industrial building have been drawn up by the Dread Leagues' most trusted architects, they simply await approval from Rosa Maledicta."

DED_Loyalty:0 "Undying Loyalty"
DED_Loyalty_desc:0 "Rosa Maledicta herself is well versed in the dark arts of magic. To ensure the loyalty of her armies, she has cast a geas on them. This geas ensures that her armies, her generals, and some of her advisors are bound into loyatly unto her. The Dread League will be largely bound to her will."

DED_Unholy_War:0 "Mors Lucis"
DED_Unholy_War_desc:0 "For countless generations, the Dread League has been hounded and sieged by the fanatical Arcturian Order. Years of preperation has gone into preparing an army to overcome our obstacles and descend South. Declaring our intentions with the Order is the last step we need to take before our great crusade can start. To war!"

DED_Black_Crusade:0 "Finis Omnium Vitarum"
DED_Black_Crusade_desc:0 "The day has finally come. With the Arcturian Order lying in ashes and many of their former citizens now serving in our undead army, we can finally set our eyes on our true goal. The Crusade against all life and the installation of what Rosa Maledicta calls 'True Order'. The time has finally arrived to call forth the Dark Crusade! The world will fear the name of the Dread League!"

######## Society of Bones
DED_Soc_Bone:0 "Choose the Society of Bones"
DED_Soc_Bone_desc:0 "The Society of Bones is run by necromancers and liches. Siding with this faction will anger the Coven of Blood, but will grant us with the ability to raise large armies of skeletons and ghouls to reign terror upon the mortal nations."

DED_Flesh_Bone:0 "Weak is the Flesh"
DED_Flesh_Bone_desc:0 "We have proposed repurposing the weak and frail within our borders to effective soldiers. The logic is sound, but our methods of doing so can be considered elegant. Those who suffered in life, serve unquestioningly in death."

DED_Work_Bone:0 "Work Them to the Bone"
DED_Work_Bone_desc:0 "Our cadavers need weapons! The Society will not sent their skeletons to fight without the proper armament of a modern army. Factories need to be built to supply our forces, to prepare for the grand crusade against life itself!"

DED_Nec_Off:0 "Order Amongst the Dead"
DED_Nec_Off_desc:0 "The Society of Bones wishes to lead their armies into war. With one of their strategically minded necromancers at the head of one of the Dread League's armies, they will be able to lead more competantly than one who cannot use necromentic spells. If they had one of their own leading an army each, we will surely see an increase in overall performance."

DED_Adv_Skele:0 "Advanced Skeleton Adaptations"
DED_Adv_Skele_desc:0 "Skeletons are different to flesh and blood ponies, they have weaknesses that ponies simply lack. Establishing a institution within the Society of Bones with the sole purpose of designing solutions to these problems. It may even give those necromancers a small boost to their egos."

DED_Skele_Skin:0 "It lives Rosa! It lives!"
DED_Skele_Skin_desc:0 "Desperate times call for desperate measures, the Society of Bones have realised this with recent internal developments concerning the Society. The grand undead army is not growing fast enough to match the growing conflicts in the world. The recently deceased shall be brought forth to bolster the armies and fuel Rosa' ambitions. The Societies' small council of liches"

DED_Skele_Armor:0 "Armoured Skeletons"
DED_Skele_Armor_desc:0 "Through the Society's efforts, most of our army is comprised of skeletons, with a smaller portion of it being zombies. Being versed in magic, some necromancers can offer their abilities to enhance specaliazed armour just for the skeletons. It won't be a perfect solution, but our forces will last longer on the battlefield."

DED_Skele_School:0 "Advanced Necromancy"
DED_Skele_School_desc:0 "The Society of Bones has been improving on their necromantic spells and abilities. These improvements have lead towards the skeletons having a limited innate ability to learn new things, unlike the previous method of applying spells to implant programmed tactics and actions into the skeletons."

DED_Skele_on_Skele:0 "A Marching Army"
DED_Skele_on_Skele_desc:0 "With our undead army giften with a limited learning ability, we can finally begin to drill proper discipline into our troops. Gone are the days of large swarming hordes firing guns haphazardly and flailing swords around, the days of the coherant and intelligent undead army have come. The future bodes well for the Dread League and the Society of Bones."

DED_Skele_In_Plane:0 "Oh my, Flying Skeletons!"
DED_Skele_In_Plane_desc:0 "With the advancement of necromatic magics, skeletons are able to pilot vehicles as advanced as planes. To best take advantage of this, we will benefit from investing our resources in developing a new plane design just for the bones of our soon-to-be pilots. The skies will fall under the domain of the Dread League once more!"

DED_Spooky_Factory:0 "Exponential Necromancy"
DED_Spooky_Factory_desc:0 "The Society of Bones is getting very efficient with their spellcasting. Grand necromantic spells are being cast upon the land the Dread League has power over. As they are woven into the fabric of the land, great hordes of the ancient dead will rise. All ready to be intergrated into Rosa's undead army. Necromancers will continue to weave this spell into new land if the dominion of the Dread League expands."

######## Vampires
DED_Guild_Blood:0 "Choose the Coven of Blood"
DED_Guild_Blood_desc:0 "The Coven of Blood is run exclusivly by vampires, most of these are ponies. These vampires will specialise turning the armies of the nation into a vampyric army supported by the elite few and their thralls. Siding with this faction will anger the Society of Bones."

DED_Lord_Lady_Death:0 "The Noble Dance of Death"
DED_Lord_Lady_Death_desc:0 "A unicorn stands surrounded. Armoured Griffin knights surround her, with a grin, she becomes a blur of pony and steel. She weaves and twirls around the squad of five with both natural elegence, and surprising ferocity. When she stops, the last knight falls to the ground, dead. "That was fun, I should have started doing this sooner, but a lady does not play with her food.""

DED_Sen_Livestock:0 "Sentient Livestock"
DED_Sen_Livestock_desc:0 "Mortals have a place below us vampires, those that don't have the privelage of becoming our feeding thralls, shall be put to use in our factories. Be it so feed the vampires we have working there, or to actually work there themselves, all shall serve us."

DED_Ed_Nob:0 "Educate the Nobles"
DED_Ed_Nob_desc:0 "The nobility form the very core of our society, whilst they may sometimes think themselves above it, they too have to work hard for their nation. The members of the nobility not put forth into combat shall henceforth study technology and doctrine, our vampyric nature should allow us to make great strides, whereas the mortals would struggle."

DED_Blood_Slave:0 "Bound by Blood"
DED_Blood_Slave_desc:0 "A higher level of obedience can be achieved through blood magic. Being vampires, we of the Coven of Blood have a natural disposition towards this kind of sorcery. Through blood magic, we can ensure our thralls are loyal and carry out our plans to their utmost ability."

DED_New_Blood:0 "Welcome the Fledglings"
DED_New_Blood_desc:0 "Rosa Maledicta's vision puts our current population in a poor position. We must increase our numbers reap the rewards of their inclusion to our coven. We seek to conquer, but not all our conquests will involve thralls or blood cattle."

DED_Vamp_Club:0 "The Vampire Elite"
DED_Vamp_Club_desc:0 "Whilst the Coven is run by the Vampire Nobility, there are two echelons, the lower, and the higher. With the castes properly defined, the lower nobility will go to war, whilst the higher nobility will work towards the betterment of the dread league through scholarship. They will still learn the ways of war, but through doctrine."

DED_Fact_Farm:0 "Industrialize the League"
DED_Fact_Farm_desc:0 "Let it be said that the Coven of Blood is above the uncultured ways of the Society of Bones. We recognise that even with all of our thralls and vampires be they fledglings or purebloods, will need weapons of war to fight our future enemies. We will establish factories to aid in the growth of our war machine."

DED_Food_Ed_Nob:0 "To Teach the Masters"
DED_Food_Ed_Nob_desc:0 "Unlike the times of old where technological changes were far and few between, it was the nobility of the Coven that taught their thralls to meet their requirements. In these coming times of war, it is the thralls and servants that teach us the modern ways of the world. Specifically the working of the weaponry. Rosa Maledicta's plans will benefit us greatly."

DED_Blood_Elect:0 "To Elect Thine Leader"
DED_Blood_Elect_desc:0 "Whilst the Dread League may be run by Rosa Maledicta. The Coven has a loose political structure, defined by the two echelons of Nobility. With a newly instituted law, both levels of the nobility will be required to vote for a leader of the Coven. This would be not only to represent the Coven, but to lead them on most internal matters."

DED_Blood_Soil:0 "Cursed be Thine Intruder"
DED_Blood_Soil_desc:0 "The Coven despise intruders on their lands, they view them as sacred and holy. Only their thralls, themselves, and invited guests are permitted within the Coven's borders. To solve this abhorrent problem, the Coven will weave dark blood rituals into the land. The Dread League's land will be coated in vampyric spells, all of them designed to drain the life out of foreign invading armies."


######## Ghouls



######## Voodoo

DED_Voodoo_Cabal:0 "Approach the Uu't U'kra Voodoo Cabal"
DED_Voodoo_Cabal_desc:0 "We should entreat the ancient Zebrican Voodoo cabal which has survived on this peninsula for centuries. The time has come to gain the support of the Uu't U'kra tribe for the first time in the history of this continent. The Uu't U'kra zebra cannot refuse the offer we have for them. They just need to meet a few requirements to begin with."

DED_Who_Voodoo:0 "What to Do With the Voodoo"
DED_Who_Voodoo_desc:0 "The Uu't U'kra Cabal cannot simply be forced to intergrate with the main body of the Dread League in just a few weeks. We must decide on how to handle the Uu't U'kra as they can finally contribute to the Dread League. Voodoo magic will support Rosa Maledicta's dream, be it directly or indirectly."

DED_You_Voodoo:0 "Voodoo in the Magehold"
DED_You_Voodoo_desc:0 "Some of the Uu't U'kra will go to the Magehold, the tribal representitive will join the Necromancer Council, joining the Society and Coven during the important meetings. From there onwards, the council will deliberate on how to best utulise the Uu't U'kra in the coming years. The tribal representitive does not hold much sway over the council."

DED_We_Voodoo:0 "Voodoo in the Darkest Forest"
DED_We_Voodoo_desc:0 "The Uu't U'kra reside in the Darkest Forest. Our recent contact with them has already benefitted us with more bodies for the war machine. When their dark magic saturates the land, it becomes more receptive towards necromantic and vampryric magics. The dead army will grow evermore."

DED_Shrunken_Head:0 "Voodoo Trophies"
DED_Shrunken_Head_desc:0 "We at the council are interested with commanding respect over the Uu't U'kra and other internal factions within the Dread League, as we wish to gain greater influence over the Dread Peninsula. Obtaining the heads of our biggest political rivals, either through force or in their sleep. It would send a message to those who would dare oppose the council, and give us more power over the Dread League."

DED_Bottle_Voodoo:0 "Zebra Potion Masters"
DED_Bottle_Voodoo_desc:0 "Zebra shaman are the most talened potion makers in the world. The  Uu't U'kra shaman are no different. They have long since incorporated voodoo into the art of brewing wild concoctions that can have many effects. Putting their skills to good use in the industrial and public sectors in the Magehold may alleviate the pressure on our industry to allow it to meet the demands of our undead army."

DED_Equal_Evil:0 "Equality under Malevolence"
DED_Equal_Evil_desc:0 "Be they Skeleton, Lich, Vampire or Zebra, everypony shares the same one goal. Conquest of the world, and the defeat of the light. Every individual in the Dread League would be labeled as vile or evil by an outsider. So let our malevolence unite us, there will be enough world out there to share after we conquer it."

DED_Sailor:0 "Sailing Stripes"
DED_Sailor_desc:0 "The Zebra are natural sailors, and the voodoo cabal is no different. Building from ancient traditions and learning from the recent innovations and doctrines stolen from other nations, the zebra will learn how to sail with a modern navy. To incorporate the Uu't U'kra as our navy, we must also construct the shipyards neccecary to facilitate the existence of the Dread Armada."

DED_Sail_Salty_Sea:0 "The Dread Armada Sails the Salty  Seas"
DED_Sail_Salty_Sea_desc:0 "Even with the best efforts of the council, our navy remains outdated. We must push the zebra cabal into designing a ship for the armada. Without a proper navy, our fleet is surely to be washed beneath the waves."

Granted, we will need to improve our spells if some of the soldiers to wield more advanced weaponry. To even begin doing that, however, will require factories to be built. We should make sure this happens."
