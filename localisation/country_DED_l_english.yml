dread_start.10.t:0 "The First and the Architect"
dread_start.10.d:0 "The long night had reached its peak when The First arrived. "The Famine is nearly upon us. Yet you still wait. Do you not understand the severity of inaction?"\n\nThe Architect preceded many, but was still bound by familial bonds to answer The First's call. "I do. Patience will be rewarded with a Feast, my beloved."\n\nThe First scoffed at this. "Patience will only get us so far. Already many of the Lesser have succumbed, yet the Famine itself hasn't even arrived. The plan must be set in motion. Now."\n\n"Just a little while longer," reassured the Architect, "I have been grooming the Heir for most of its life. It will be the perfect Vessel to bring about the Feast. All that remains is for the Dark to be removed, and for the Heir to take its place."\n\n"Do not presume that you can put off my demands until later. Yet I see this plan of yours is not without merit. You have until the Heir's mortal coil is extinguished. If your plan is not enacted by that point, then I shall see that you suffer the same fate the Lesser."\n\nThe First departed, leaving the Architect alone to watch over the night once more. "Perhaps..." mused the Architect, "Perhaps the Heir could use a little push in the right direction.""
dread_start.10.a:0 "Fear not the Dark..."

dread_start.101.t:0 "Dread Calling"
dread_start.101.d:0 ""Curious..." mused the ancient lich. He stood outside his chamber; the door in front of him was ajar. The lich peered inside, but found nothing out of the ordinary, save for a parchment laying atop his desk. He levitated it closer so that he could inspect it further, and saw that it was written in the ancient language found within the tomes of Magehold's Library. Surely it couldn't be...\n\n"Corpus Maledictus,\nYou have performed your role as Dread King admirably in the years since your predecessor had perished. The time has come for a new age, one which will usher in a world of magic never before seen by mortals. Naturally, an immortal like yourself should be the one to bring about this power to your kingdom. Carnes, Sanguis, Fidelis, Luvenis, all have served their purpose, and now it is time for you to serve yours as well.\nMordator commands you to break open the Third Seal. The following words of power will grant you the ability to breach the magical barrier guarding a power unlike any you have ever seen before...\n\nAs Corpus read the esoteric phrases contained within the parchment, he turned his head upwards and began to cackle. He had never been that devout during his time in the Ossuary, but he still believed that Mordator watched over them. Now he had proof."
dread_start.101.a:0 ""Finally, the recognition that I deserve.""

DED_Brain_Train:0 "Putting our Brains on a Train"
DED_Brain_Train_desc:0 "Ghouls can be very ravenous people, and can consume large quantities of meat. Replacing meat with rationed cuts of brain matter will provide ghouls and zombies with a more sating food to consume on the field. This should allow more efficient management with supplies during long wars, as much the ghouls do not need to consume as much brain as they do flesh. This way the undead army has a way of staying ahead!"

DED_High_Ed:0 "The Ghoulish Institute"
DED_High_Ed_desc:0 "Our armies need training. The Council of the Dread League will implement plans to put together a training institute to further improve the potency of our soldiers. This training institute is much more efficient with their training drills, and is geared towards all forms of undead soldiers. Further plans may be drafted to introduce morale officers if army cohesion remains a problem."

DED_Work_Tool_Ghoul:0 "Factory Ghouls"
DED_Work_Tool_Ghoul_desc:0 "Not all ghouls are destined for the army or smarter jobs within the Dread League, some ghouls remain permanently handicapped as their brains have partially rotted.

DED_Spook_Regulate_desc:0 "The Dread League is starting to feel the burden of not organising its internal structure. The Council wishes to change this and impose regulations on the League.

DED_Commisar_Ghoul:0 "A Very Ghoulish Commissar"

POLITICS_CORPUS_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! 313 ALB, Somewhere in the Dread Peninsula\n\n§YAscended:§! 349 ALB\n\n§YCoronated:§! 996 ALB\n\n§YBiography:§! Known for his extensive narcissism, Corpus would have been just another lich if he had not possessed enough magical talent to overpower anyone who challenged him. Within his first few years of unlife, he had already proven himself to be more adept at necromancy than the vast majority of his peers. His skills attracted the attention of the Salvific Ossuary, which quickly inducted Corpus into their order.\n\nIn the centuries that followed, Corpus steadily rose through the ranks of the cult. This drew the ire of his fellow cultists, who knew that he obtained his positions not through religious zealotry, but through his natural talents. Perhaps the greatest heresy in their eyes was when Corpus became the High Priest in 941. Corpus didn't care about their religion in the slightest, but he couldn't resist the power that came with the position, for it earned him a seat on the Dread Council.\n\nSince then, he had neglected to do anything of substance for the religion he was in charge of, instead using and abusing his power to secure his position above all else. In 996, resentment within the cult's ranks had nearly reached a boiling point when their greatest wish came true: Corpus renounced his position as High Priest. He had taken a greater seat of power, one that previously belonged to the late Luvenis Maledicta, who had suffered her final death in her ill-fated conquest against the Arcturians.\n\nThus began the reign of the newest Dread King, Corpus Maledictus. A selfish lich who only takes action when it benefits him, and few are powerful enough to stand in his way.\n\n§YPortrait By:§! Neither"

MILITARY_SKELLINORE_DESC:0 "§YSummoned§!: 19th of October 992, in Neyhorn\n\n§YRank§!: Militia Leader\n\n§YBiography§!: Skellinore's post-death existence, in many ways, is an accident on the part of an Animus necromancer, Obit Animata, who sought to raise a mighty warrior to lead his army. Skellinore is not and never has been a warrior in her past life, and when the truth came out, her summoner was very displeased. Had any other necromancer done the deed, they would have cut the tendrils of unlife on a seemingly useless being.\n\nObit Animata, however, deemed the ritual of raising an intelligent undead too much of an investment to rid himself of Skellinore. He instead drafted the former scholar as a leader of his militia, despite Skellinore's reluctance and ineptitude.\n\nWith the threat of oblivion should she disappoint her new master, Skellinore had no choice but to take the helm as Obit Animata's militia leader. Though she had many difficulties, Skellinore has grown into her new position. In time, she has developed the logistical and experience needed to lead Obit Animata's hosts with a degree of competency that has yet to upset him.\n\nThis was not a path that Skellinore had ever considered in her previous life or this unlife. However, it is one that she can perhaps excel at despite all of the odds stacked against her. Maybe one day, she may even break free of her unlife of indentured servitude.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"
