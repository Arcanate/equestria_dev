DED_START_council:0 "Another Day at the Helm"
DED_START_council_desc:0 "For centuries the Dread Council has held meetings to discuss recent happenings or issues in or around the Dread Peninsula. Though the late Luvenis Maledicta had proven our ability to put a dent into the armour of those fanatical knights, Corpus has yet to take advantage of the plundered land. Despite being repeatedly pestered by the council to press our benefit, he remains complacent with our current position."

DED_START_magehold:0 "Within the Well of Knowledge"
DED_START_magehold_desc:0 "The Magisterium has been a center of learning ever since The Library had been discovered. Many within were surprised to hear the announcement about the Third Seal and are eager to hear Vetus' opinion on the matter, should he be lucid enough to give one."

DED_START_Dominus:0 "Whispers Under the Pines' Shades"
DED_START_Dominus_desc:0 "In command of House Dominus is one of the most influential vampires within the Dread Peninsula: The elusive Count Dominus. Known for prying into others' business, the sudden announcement came as a surprise to him and his cabal. Perhaps an internal discussion on the matter is in order..."

DED_START_Concors:0 "The Court of the Twin Rulers"
DED_START_Concors_desc:0 "House Concors has remained the most stable clan of vampires for almost a millenia, despite constant internal strife. It is known for its core philosophy: Limited "free will" for their thralls. As the representative of the Concors Twins, Baron Greten knows more than anygriff that Corpus' proclamation is worth disturbing his masters for, even if it means having to suffer through their hedonistic chambers."

DED_START_Ruber:0 "The Crimson Mare's Progeny" 
DED_START_Ruber_desc:0 "Aside from the Progenitor, Lady Rubra is the oldest living vampire in the known world. She and her clan command the fiercest of thralls and, as they claim, the strongest bloodline. Those within House Rubra have always supported the Dread Council. Still, some wonder what Corpus' announcement might mean for their future."

DED_START_Aeternum:0 "The Stitchers' Dream"
DED_START_Aeternum_desc:0 "Those who subscribe to the beliefs of Aeternum are often the most open to new ideas and change. With the recent announcement from Corpus, these eccentric necromancers have gone wild with speculation as to what new forms of magic might await them and their undead monstrosities."

DED_START_Animus:0 "The Beauty of Undeath"
DED_START_Animus_desc:0 "Raising a corpse isn't just a spell, it's an art form. Necromancers in the Animus Center pride themselves on their semi-autonomous undead, often showcasing how most of their intelligence can be retained after death. Some are wondering if the recent announcement could lead into a deeper understanding of reanimation."

DED_START_Potentia:0 "The Purity of Desire"
DED_START_Potentia_desc:0 "It is no secret that the Cult of [POTENTIA RENAME] is reviled by the other necromancers, yet these mad mages do not seem to care. What do others know of power? The only way to become a true necromancer is to devote oneself to Mortador. Because of this, they are seen as the laughing stock of the League. Perhaps the Third Seal may be the key to regaining their glory?"

DED_START_Seal:0 "The Magnum Opus of Corpus Maledictus"
DED_START_Seal_desc:0 "As the clock strikes twelve, liches, vampires, and mages of all kinds begin to gather for what Corpus has heralded as the dawn of a new age for the Dread League. Whether he will actually be able to make good on his words is another story, however."

dread_start.1.t:0 "Dread Calling"
dread_start.1.d:0 ""Curious..." mused the ancient lich. He stood outside his chamber, the door leading inside was open. The lich peered inside, but found nothing out of the ordinary, save for a parchment laying atop his desk. He levitated it closer so that he could inspect it further, and saw that it was written in the ancient language found within the tomes of Magehold's Library. Surely it couldn't be...\n\n"Corpus Maledictus,\nYou have performed your role as Dread King admirably in the years since your predecessor had perished. The time has come for a new age, one which will usher in a world of magic never before seen by mortals. Naturally, an immortal like yourself should be the one to bring about this power to your kingdom. Carnes, Sanguis, Fidelis, Luvenis, all have served their purpose, and now it is time for you to serve yours as well.\nMordator commands you to break open the Third Seal. The following words of power will grant you the ability to breach the magical barrier...\n\nAs Corpus read the esoteric phrases contained within the parchment, he turned his head upwards and cackled, for Mordator had finally answered his prayers."
dread_start.1.a:0 ""Finally, the recognition that I deserve.""

dread_start.11.t:0 "Another Day in the Dread Council"
dread_start.11.d:0 "The meeting began as any other, with pointless bickering and groaning. The seven members of the Dread Council sat around one another at an obsidian table decorated with ancient runes used by the first necromancers. Among them were three vampires, two liches, and two still-living mages. There was an eighth seat larger than the others, but the dust layering its rugged cushion betrayed how often it was used.\n\nIt had been two years since Corpus had stopped showing up to the Dread Council's annual meetings, and three more since he had stopped listening to their advice altogether. This had left the council to focus mainly on each other's faults and shortcomings since they could no longer count on Corpus to settle matters within the Dread League. There were a few things that they could agree on, however: their mutual dislike for Corpus Maledictus.\n\nWhy do we even bother with these meetings if Corpus isn't going to show up?" grumbled a furious lich by the name of Lux Tenebris, "Wasn't the point of them to counsel the current Maledictus?"\n\nMost of the other council members murmured in agreement. The League hadn't managed to accomplish much lately, and their tenuous grasp over [THE PASSAGE] wasn't being properly exploited. There were still pockets of unclaimed peasants left, even after ten years of controlling their land! Corpus had neglected to divide the spoils amongst the Dread Council, and thus they never did settle on an agreement for what to do with the area.\n\nSoon arguments turned back towards differing opinions on how to handle the "Arcturian Menace" that had been bothering them for the past millennium. Many were in agreement that something needed to be done, but none could agree on a proper strategy to combat those wretched knights.\n\nAs the hours went on with countless quarrels going unresolved, two representatives from the vampire clans rose from their seats, not wanting to waste their time any further. As they announced their intention to leave, a loud creak could be heard across the room. All heads turned to see an elegantly robed lich step through the door."
dread_start.11.a:0 ""I apologize for being late.""

dread_start.12.t:0 "The Dread King's Announcement"
dread_start.12.d:0 ""LATE?! You believe yourself to be merely late?!" screeched Lady Rubra, the eldest of the vampire lords. Beside her stood Count Dominus and Baron Greten. They seemed equally furious; the former was coldy staring down Corpus while the latter clenched his claws to restrain himself.\n\nOn the other side of the room, a mortal unicorn rose from his seat. "If it's all the same to you, I would like to return to my work. I have nearly finished my latest creation."\n\nAn elderly lich by the name of Timor Virtute raised a hoof to his associate, "Magnus, your 'creation' can wait. Perhaps Corpus has a good reason to be here today." Timor shifted his gaze towards the indifferent Dread King, "Or perhaps he does not."\n\nLux Tenebris, despite her grandstanding disposition as the High Priestess of [POTENTIA RENAME] remained silent, but her hatred could be felt emanating off of her bones.\n\nTutor Libra, the only council member not affiliated with the necromancers or vampires, merely sighed.\n\nCorpus leisurely walked over to his chair, magically dusted it off, then sat upon it. "I have an important announcement for you all today."\n\nBaron Greten scoffed, "An announcement? What of the ongoing issues that we've been trying-"\n\n"I assure you my good Baron," interrupted Corpus, "that what I am going to do will fix most, if not all of those issues." Corpus' horn ignited, the swirl of his sickly green aura permeating throughout the central table. After a moment, it seemed to construct a glowing replica of the Library of Magehold. "As you all know, the Library is the source of our knowledge and power. For aeons it has held countless tomes and scrolls of ancient knowledge, but most of it was held behind the Great Seals. Over a thousand years ago, our esteemed Librarian Vetus Maledictus broke two of these Great Seals, granting us the powers of Lichdom and Vampirism."\n\nLady Rubra rolled her eyes in annoyance, "Some of us were there, remember? Get to the point."\n\n"My friends, I am going to break open the Third Great Seal.""
dread_start.12.a:0 "He's going to do what?"

dread_start.2.t:0 "The Magisterium's Keeper"
dread_start.2.d:0 "Ornate candles illuminated the chambers of the Library of Magehold. Many scholars and mages could be seen roaming the halls, studying and organizing the carefully preserved tomes that numbered in the tens of thousands.\n\nOne scholar in particular was trotting through the halls in a hurry, however. Wearing the signature robe that indicated membership of the Dread Council, Tutor Libra was seeking out the oldest creature in the Dread League: Vetus Maledictus. She needed to consult the ancient lich regarding the proclamation of Corpus.\n\nTutor passed by a pair of mages examining one of the many magical seals blocking off sections of the Library. Though a significant number of minor seals had been broken by Vetus, some even by other mages, countless more still hide vast sections of the Library. The place was already a maze to begin with; each month, the maps needed to be updated with newly accessible areas.\n\nShe had a hunch of where to find Vetus, though. Tutor made her way to the grand spiral staircase that separated the major sections of the Library. As she descended, she saw a magnificent white glow from below. When she reached the bottom, she saw a lone, hooded figure standing in front of the glimmering magical barrier. The Third Great Seal. Beyond it was... who knows? Something comparable to the power of liches and vampires, that's for sure.\n\nTutor cleared her throat, stepping forward, "Vetus, I bring news. Corpus intends to breach the next Great Seal, and, well... I would like to know your thoughts on that."\n\nIf the hooded figure heard her, it didn't seem to acknowledge it. Tutor was about to clear her throat again when she heard Vetus' old, decrepit voice murmur something. She couldn't quite make out his words, so she stepped closer. "Vetus? Did you hear me?"\n\nThe figure turned towards her, revealing a withered husk of a stallion. Dried flesh and piercing yellow eyes bored into her, sending shivers up her spine. Vetus Maledictus then returned his gaze to the barrier, murmuring, "Time is approaching its end, and only one will be able to see it. The mare and the wind will battle, and death itself will die. Then the future will be certain.""

dread_start.21.t:0 "Musings Of The Librarian"
dread_start.21.d:0 "Vetus Maledictus stood by one of the many bookshelves within the Magisterium. He had read them all before, but could not recall what was inside any of them. Many mages passed by him, some even stopping to offer a modicum of gratitude for granting them the power they now possessed. He paid them no mind, though. Something was troubling him, and he was having a difficult time figuring out what it was.\n\nIt had been over a millenia since he had first stepped hoof into this place; he had brought the curse of Lichdom to those who called it a gift, and when more ponies begged for the power to fight back against the undead, he cursed them with eternal life. The two Great Seals which held those powers had been explored thoroughly, yet more was being discovered each year. Perhaps in time, they may uncover the secret within the Third Great Seal.\n\nOne thing didn't change, though. Everyone who sought power in Magehold ended up corrupted, power-hungry, or downright evil. Rarely did an aspiring mage or other creature last more than a year without succumbing to the darkness of this harrowing realm.\n\nHowever...\n\nVetus gazed at one mage among the crowd, a young mare who was studiously reading one of many books on necromancy. There was something about her that bothered him. He'd seen her plenty of times before, but she never seemed to change. Maybe she was different?"
dread_start.21.a:0 "Perhaps..."

dread_start.3.t:0 "The Opulent Lord of Secrets"
dread_start.3.d:0 "The grand manor belonging to House Dominus was unusually silent today. Not to say that it wasn't typically quiet, but every vampire within its corridors seemed extremely unnerved. They were right to be: Count Dominus was meeting with his most trusted spy ring, an elite group of vampires known for succeeding where many other aspiring spies failed: slipping past the border into the territory of the Arcturian Order and beyond. And if all of them had been recalled here, then something big must be happening.\n\nWithin the clandestine chamber lounged several vampires, awaiting orders from their Count. He sat in his chair, brooding and unmoving. He was known to remain still for hours at a time, something that put almost everyone near him on edge.\n\nJust as one vampire opened her mouth to say something, Count Dominus rose from his chair, silencing her before she even began. "Corpus intends to break the Third Seal, my brethren."\n\nNaught but stillness came from the spy ring. The Count continued, "Though I have my doubts on his ability to follow through on this proclamation, we must prepare for the possibility that he does succeed. That is what the rest of our clan will deal with. You all, on the other hoof," he stepped towards the map on the central table, placing his hoof upon the section of the Dread Peninsula indicating Magehold, "There are some within our very land who would seek to take advantage of this opportunity. If anyone makes plans regarding Corpus or the Dread Council, I will be the first to know. Understood?""
dread_start.3.a:0 "The other vampires nodded, then faded away into the darkness."

dread_start.4.t:0 "Frater et Sororis"
dread_start.4.d:0 "The deepest chamber of House Concors plays a unique role within the Coven of Blood: It is a place where vampires can choose to send their enthralled to mingle with one another and be allowed complete and total freedom, so long as they do not abuse this privilege. The other clans scorned this idea, but the Concors Twins were difficult to argue with. This became more apparent shortly after Corpus took the throne; the Twins retreated into their chamber, refusing to leave for any reason. Ever since then, they've spent their days engaged with the enthralled of other vampires as if they were their equals.\n\nThis was where Baron Greten found himself now. He gazed at the grand wooden doors that were ornately crafted to show several ponies, some of which were painted red, holding hooves in a circle around one another. He sighed as he opened the door. He enjoyed his position as representative of the Concors Twins, but some days were more difficult for him than others. The curse of Vampirism did not treat griffons well. \n\nImmediately he was assaulted with the scent of hundreds of living ponies and griffons. He had to restrain himself as he entered the grand chamber. The Concors Twins were at the very center, no doubt sharing hedonistic stories with the mortals around them. Baron Greten made his way through the crowd, making his presence known by coughing loudly. The brother-sister duo in charge of House Concors ceased their storytelling, then turned their attention to their approaching representative.\n\nBaron Greten wasted no time in getting straight to the point. "Corpus says he's going to open the Third Seal."\n\nThe Twins nodded. "Let us know when he is about to begin the process," they spoke simultaneously, "And we will be there to witness it.""
dread_start.4.a:0 "Without another word, they returned to telling stories."

dread_start.5.t:0 "The Crimson Mare"
dread_start.5.d:0 "The lush, extravagant manor belonging to the elite of House Rubra was one of the most difficult places to earn entry into. Lady Rubra was very particular about the guests that she allowed inside, and for good reason: The interior held the finest decor in the entire Dread Peninsula.\n\nIn centuries past, Lady Rubra had undergone some expeditions to "acquire" some of the fancier furnishings, rugs, paintings, and so forth from the undomesticated mortals of the world. Savage brutes they were, though she had to admit that sometimes they could produce exquisite works of art. She took a sip from her champagne glass, then wiped her mouth clean of the red fluid it contained.\n\n"Disgusting." she expressed with a wretched tone. "Winters, fetch me a new bottle. Something high-grade."\n\nA young stallion wearing a butler's outfit approached her with the utmost respect. "Right away, Madam." He quickly retrieved the bottle, glass, and the blood-stained napkin, then began to make his way towards the cellar.\n\nLady Rubra thought back to Corpus' announcement from the other day. She loathed having to deal with such an uncivilized moron, but perhaps there was an opportunity to take advantage of. If the Third Seal held a great power, then perhaps it might be worth making nice with that uncouth brute for the time being.\n\nShe smiled. Her bloodline had always been the purest, and her progeny knew it. The power within the Third Seal would be hers, and if she had to play nice to get it, then there was nobody she wouldn't sink her teeth into."
dread_start.5.a:0 ""Winters, what is taking you so long!?""

dread_start.6.t:0 "The Mad Doctor"
dread_start.6.d:0 "As Magnus Medicus returned to his personal workshop, he took a moment to ponder the implications of what Corpus had said. If the Third Great Seal was truly about to be opened, then it would be prudent to let the other stitchers of Aeternum know to be ready for a wealth of incoming knowledge. Who knows? There might be new methods for reanimation that they could apply to their various creations. In any case, Magnus needed to prepare his thoughts to present to the other stitchers, and he knew just how to focus his mind.\n\nMagnus sat down on a stool next to a bloodied table. Donning an equally bloodied lab coat borrowed from his brief tenure at the University of Gamia, he set to work on his latest project: an intact pony corpse with an extra four legs surgically attached to its upper body, each of which had three additional joints stitched onto it. He just needed to align the joints of the new legs so they would reach the ground with the same ease as the old ones, and he could consider this one finished.\n\n"M-Master? Y-You have a g-guest that wishes to s-speak with you..."\n\nMagnus swiveled to see his personal minion, Servus. It was a sad thing, merely being a skull attached to two foal legs. Not very formidable, but it could ferry messages quite well. "Tell them that I need to focus, and that I will be with them in an hour." He returned to his work. These ghouls wouldn't stitch themselves together, after all.\n\n"M-Master, I m-must insist... it's M-Multa Corpora."\n\nMagnus set down his retractor. Despite creating countless ghouls with inspiration from that monstrosity of bones, he always hated dealing with it. Multa Corpora was a textbook example of what not to do with necromancy, something that every denizen of Magehold feared and respected. Composed of several bodies merged together in undying matrimony, it was extremely dangerous if angered. If it wanted to speak with him, then it would be unwise to deny it a conversation. At least it had the courtesy to ask politely, which was more than what Magnus could expect of Corpus."
dread_start.6.a:0 ""Very well, let it in.""

dread_start.7.t:0 "The Ancient Academic"
dread_start.7.d:0 "The bell tolled, signifying that the assembly was about to begin. Hundreds of aspiring and seasoned necromancers, living and unliving alike, gathered in the Great Hall of Animus, the premiere learning center for those interested in traditional necromancy. Hushed discussions could be heard throughout the hall, as many speculated about the purpose of the assembly. A gathering like this hadn't occurred since the death of Luvenis eleven years ago.\n\nThe mages began to quiet down when a modestly robed lich approached the stage. As the Rector of the Animus Institution, Timor Virtute enjoyed a significant amount of respect from the majority of creatures within the Dread League. His advances in the theorized creation of a fully autonomous undead have brought many necromancers leaps and bounds closer to realizing their full potential.\n\nA pregnant pause preceded Timor as he reached the podium. He gazed out across the vast crowd in front of him, then began to speak. "As you know, any mage can raise a corpse. There are many styles of necromancy, from the ghastly creations of the Stitchers to the malevolent power manifested within Potentia's bone hordes. But here, we practice necromancy for its original intention: To bring the dead back to life. This is our purpose here, and I hope that in your personal studies to further your abilities, you will continue to adhere to this principle."\n\nTimor stopped for a moment, then continued his speech, "Recently, Corpus Maledictus has announced that he will try to break the Third Great Seal. Inside of it lies a great power, but as for what it could be, we do not know. I encourage you all to prepare yourselves to incorporate whatever knowledge the Third Seal may contain into your own projects. Once I have more information on this matter, I will let you all know. Until then..."

dread_start.71.t:0 "Of Hopes and Dreams"
dread_start.71.d:0 "With a long sigh, Wilted Rose closed the dusty tome she had been reading. She had been studying the works of an ancient lich in an attempt to further her understanding of necromancy, but with every book she finished the teachings became less and less worthwhile. The old liches spoke of the many aspects that went into raising a corpse, but few delved into the theory of why. Those that did question the moral aspects of raising the dead never went past surface-level questions.\n\nThe young unicorn placed the tome back into the bookshelf. She'd been attending the Animus Institute for a few years now, but her studies had been stymied once she learned that the necromancers here had the same difficulty with raising lifelike corpses as she did.\n\nTruthfully, Wilted was starting to reconsider her life choices. Ever since she'd gotten her cutie mark, she had faced nothing but opposition from everypony that she had shown her talent to. Her family, friends, and classmates had all scorned her and told her to never practice "vile magic like that," but deep down she knew that it wasn't inherently evil. She had wanted to prove to them that she could use it for good, to give ponies a chance to say goodbye to their loved ones, but she faced one major challenge that she just couldn't overcome: Her undead didn't retain their intelligence, at least not enough to act like they were alive.\n\nDespite her best efforts to learn from some of the greatest necromancers in the world, Wilted Rose was no closer to her goal than when she had started. Still, she didn't give up hope. She just had to keep trying, no matter how long it took."

dread_start.8.t:0 "The High Priestess"
dread_start.8.d:0 "Lux Tenebris leisurely walked through the corridors of her sect's domain. Behind her calm exterior was a cold, calculated fury. It was no secret that she despised Corpus and his slothful disposition, something that the current state of [POTENTIA RENAME]'s forces constantly reminded her of.\n\nShe scowled. Corpus Maledictus had been a blight on their reputation for years. Before he became the Dread King, he had previously been the High Priest for [POTENTIA RENAME], a title that now rightfully belonged to her. Lux had no idea how he had managed to secure that position. Corpus was an unbeliever, a heretic who had led several other liches astray from the faith.\n\nWith talk of the Third Seal's proposed breaking, a new opportunity has arisen, one that she couldn't stop thinking about. What glorious magic awaited them behind it? Whatever it was, many tasks would need to be done: Preparations for new knowledge to enter their practices and rituals, offerings to Mortador, and magical drills for their acolytes. Most importantly, Corpus would need to be dealt with.\n\nThe biggest issue she faced was one she loathed to admit: Corpus was formidable, perhaps even the most powerful mage within the Dread League. Knowing that he squandered that power twisted her bones so very much.\n\nLux paused by a dusty mirror to take a look at herself. Her flesh was completely gone, but her immaculate bones glistened in the candlelight, complimented by her ornate robes. She prided herself on her perfect bone structure; most other liches got a scratch or crack over the centuries. Not Lux Tenebris, though. She was better than them. Better than Corpus, even."

Normally this isn't a huge cause for concern, but they went ahead and marched past their walls to slay dozens of ancient vampires and liches! Our undercover vampires say that the Arcturians became filled with a "righteous fervor" after their Headmaster had died, but none of them seem to know how it happened.\n\nRegardless, the loss of such valuable mages will certainly be of interest to the Dread Council, who will see this as proof that Corpus is unfit to lead. If the Arcturians can easily storm into our territory and kill us as they please, then who is say that they won't go for Magehold next? All that remains is for the news to reach them."

DED_Spook_Regulate:0 "Ghoulish Regulations"
DED_Spook_Regulate_desc:0 "The Dread League is starting to feel the burden of not organising its internal structure. The Council wishes to change this and impose regulations on the League. It would curtail the consumption of food and other basic commodities, the Dread League would be more capable of developing its land with less factory space dedicated to the domestic needs of its people."

DED_Commisar_Ghoul_desc:0 "Our armies need stronger leadership in the field, so squads and regiments should be led by fearsome commissars trained by the Institute.

 ###Voodoo

DED_Voodoo_Cabal:0 "Approach the Uu't U'kra Voodoo Cabal"
DED_Voodoo_Cabal_desc:0 "We should entreat the ancient Zebrican Voodoo cabal which has survived on this peninsula for centuries. The time has come to gain the support of the Uu't U'kra tribe for the first time in the history of this continent. The Uu't U'kra zebra cannot refuse the offer we have for them. They just need to meet a few requirements to begin with."

DED_Who_Voodoo:0 "What to Do With the Voodoo"
DED_Who_Voodoo_desc:0 "The Uu't U'kra Cabal cannot simply be forced to integrate with the main body of the Dread League in just a few weeks. We must decide on how to handle the Uu't U'kra as they can finally contribute to the Dread League. Voodoo magic will support Rosa Maledicta's dream, be it directly or indirectly."

DED_We_Voodoo:0 "Voodoo for the Uu't U'kra"
DED_We_Voodoo_desc:0 "Our recent contact with the Uu't U'kra has already benefited our army with more bodies for the undead war machine. When the zebra tribe practices their dark magic, it saturates the land and makes it more receptive towards necromantic and vampryric magic. The dead army will grow evermore, like a tidal wave over washing over a shallow coast."

DED_You_Voodoo:0 "Voodoo for the Dread Council"
DED_You_Voodoo_desc:0 "The Dread Council is interested in the zebra art of voodoo, as a result; a tribal representative will join the Necromancer Council. Where they will join the Society and Coven during the important council meetings. From there onwards, the council will deliberate on how to best utilise the Uu't U'kra in the coming years. The tribal representative does not hold much sway over the council."

DED_Shrunken_Head:0 "Voodoo Trophies"
DED_Shrunken_Head_desc:0 "We at the council are interested with commanding respect over the Uu't U'kra and other internal factions within the Dread League, as we wish to gain greater influence over the Dread Peninsula. Claiming the heads of several rivals would certainly send a message to those who would dare oppose the council, and give us more power over the Dread League."

DED_Bottle_Voodoo:0 "Zebra Potion Masters"
DED_Bottle_Voodoo_desc:0 "Zebra shamans are the most talented potion makers in the world. The Uu't U'kra shamans are no different. They have long since incorporated voodoo into the art of brewing wild concoctions that can have many effects. Putting their skills to good use in the industrial and public sectors in Magehold may alleviate the pressure on our industry to allow it to meet the demands of our undead army."

DED_Equal_Evil:0 "Equality under Malevolence"
DED_Equal_Evil_desc:0 "Be they Skeleton, Lich, Vampire or Zebra, everypony shares the same one goal, conquest of the world and the defeat of the light. Every individual in the Dread League would be labelled as vile or evil by an outsider. So let our malevolence unite us, there will be enough world out there to share after we conquer it."

DED_Sailor:0 "Sailing Stripes"
DED_Sailor_desc:0 "The Zebra are natural sailors, and the voodoo cabal is no different. Building from ancient traditions and learning from the recent innovations and doctrines stolen from other nations, the zebra will learn how to sail with a modern navy. To incorporate the Uu't U'kra as our navy, we must also construct the shipyards necessary to facilitate the existence of the Dread Armada."

DED_Sail_Salty_Sea:0 "The Dread Armada Sails the Salty Seas"
DED_Sail_Salty_Sea_desc:0 "Even with the best efforts of the council, our navy remains outdated. we must push the zebra cabal into designing a ship for the armada. Without a proper navy, our fleet is surely to be washed beneath the waves."

DED_Construction2:0 "Working Stiffs"
DED_Construction2_desc:0 "The first round of land improvements went well. But we can do better. Instead of relying on the normal channels, we will assign special task forces of 'conscripted' forces to work round the clock and complete the next phase in our grand vision."

DED_Construction3:0 "Souls into Cinders"
DED_Construction3_desc:0 "Ah, the sound of progress! Pounding pistons, clanging hammers, and the screams of the damned. One of our members has suggested the use of specialised fuel for our new factories. Soulgems, which, when exposed to the right necromantic magic, will provide more power than anything we've previously discovered. We will erect a few more factories with this innovation installed in order to test his theory."

DED_Mil_Construction:0 "Guns for Ghouls"
DED_Mil_Construction_desc:0 "What good is an army if we can't equip it? The days of endless hordes shambling across the fields and rending flesh from bone with bare claws and hooves are over. Our enemies have guns and artillery. We must adapt and change, adopting the advances while leaving aside the backwards views of our neighbours. But only with a properly equipped army will we be able to take them on."

DED_Mil_Construction2:0 "Grim Reaper's Industry"
DED_Mil_Construction2_desc:0 "We must increase our ability to wage war. Yes, we need more troops, but we still must make sure they are equipped. After all, a gun without bullets to shoot is simply an over-designed and not very effective club."

DED_Mil_Construction3:0 "Arsenal of Hades"

DED_Modern_Technology_idea:0 "Society of Technological Superiority"

DED_Burst_The_Shell:0 "Burst the Shell"
DED_Burst_The_Shell_desc:0 "A crude metaphor, perhaps, for what we are truly doing, but one that I think communicates the idea quite nicely. Well, at least it does to me. And it will confuse and confound our enemies, so there is no great loss there."

 #### Leaders
POLITICS_ROSAINITIAL_DESC:0 "Rosa Maledicta is one of many necromancers who are struggling for control over the fractured nation which is the Dread League. Rosa has recently risen as the de-facto leader of the necromancer council, but in the fickle lands of darkness that may well quickly change. Rosa rules with an iron fist, crushing all opposition with ruthless aggression and tyranny. Once a unicorn living in the peaceful lands of Equestria, she has been called to the land of the dead by promises of power and justice. She was never happy in Equestria. Ponies rejected her dark talents and she has been betrayed by her old pony friends more times than she can count. Never again. If the world will not love her, the world will learn to fear the name of Rosa Maledicta."
POLITICS_ROSALICH_DESC:0 "This monster is a far cry from the unicorn of old. Rosa Maledicta has enacted a dark ritual and turned herself into a ferocious lich. With her phylactery well hidden, she is now pulsing with dark power. Her seeming invincibility makes her cocky and aggressive. If she was ruthless before, now she has redefined the meaning of the word. Rosa seems angrier than before, quick to take life and raise it again in her service. Any remark about her monstrous appearance is quickly rewarded with death and she strides with a wicked confidence. No longer does she need to harsh punishments and harsher threats to keep her fellow necromancers in line, now she simply does such things for the pleasure. She is Rosa Maledicta the Queen of Bones. She comes for your soul and there will be no negotiation."
POLITICS_ROSAVAMPIRE_DESC:0 "While the beauty of some ponies is a blissful dream, Rosa's is much more akin to a dark yet sensual nightmare. She flaunts her new vampiric skin quite readily and her harsh tyranny has cooled somewhat. One might be mistaken into thinking Rosa has become much more agreeable. One would be very wrong. Rosa is just as forceful and tyrannical as ever, but instead of almost desperate anger. She struts. There is a quiet sensual confidence about her which pulls others to her way of thinking. She has learned the vampire arts of influence well, and wields it masterfully. She is Rosa Maledicta the Queen of Blood. She comes for your soul and there will be no negotiation."

 ###Chalice Event Chain

deadempire.3.t:0 "The Quest for the Chalice"
deadempire.3.d:0 "In order to solidify her rule as Queen of the Dead, Rosa Maledicta must embark on a quest to find an ancient unholy artefact. The chalice of blood.\n\nShe has spent many a long nights searching for clues and answers in the dark catacombs of Magehold. After all, the chalice has been lost for a millenia. While many thought it to be lost forever in the dark wasteland of the Dread League, there are always whispers and dark motions of something hidden. A greater calling must await.\n\nFervently Rosa has searched, and now she believes she has found its location. Deep in the icy mountains of the north, she believes the dark artefact lies. Legend speaks of the last great Queen of the Dead who sealed the chalice away in a great castle. However, due to the cataclysm which destroyed the empire of undead, it was lost.\n\nNow however, Rosa has uncovered a map which points the location of the old castle. She has begun preparing an expedition into the icy mountains. The journey will be long and tiring, but she must succeed if she is to become what she was truly meant to be!"
deadempire.3.a:0 "The Chalice will be mine!"

deadempire.4.t:0 "The Door, and the Riddle"
deadempire.4.d:0 "Rosa Maledicta and her undead thralls travelled long into the night, finally coming upon an ancient set of ruins of the old Dread Empire. The north was cold and Rosa had lost a few of her necromancers to the frozen hazardous conditions. She cursed them for being weak fools and simply rose them from death as her undead thralls.\n\n"If you cannot serve me in life... You will serve me in death, weaklings," she snarled before continuing on her journey.\n\nAs Rosa approached the ruins, they shifted and moved, sensing her presence. After a moment the ruins seem to part to reveal a dark stone door, engraved with the face of a skull.\n\nThis had to be the place. All of the research, all of the signs show this. Today was the day she found the chalice and claimed it by very birthright - right of power.\n\nFull of determination, she stepped closer only to realise the face was animated and moving. Upon examination with her magic, Rosa found that it was in fact a spirit which had been latched to the door to guard it. No doubt the previous Queen of the Dead's guard dog. "There is but one surety. One purpose. One peace. One outcome. One truth. Of what do I speak?" The door whispers to the group.\n\nCould it be, Rosa's grand ascension was blocked by something as petty and stupid as an infernal riddle! With great annoyance Rosa stepped closer to the face and answered..."
deadempire.4.a:0 "This is death... of course."
deadempire.4.b:0 "The answer is... Taxes."
deadempire.4.c:0 "I don't have time for petty riddles!"

deadempire.5.t:0 "The Chalice"
deadempire.5.d:0 "The door chuckles in amusement. "Very good, you understand. The only truth in this life, is death. The cycle must be broken so that we may ascend to better things than this." With that, it parted and opened for Rosa, leaving the mare a little shocked.\n\nThe door had spoken a truth she had known for a long time. The living must be purged from the world, so that they might ascend to be the gods of creation they should be. With renewed faith that she was doing the right thing, she strode forwards and into a large domed room shrouded in darkness. The very air was thick with the smell of black magic, and in the centre of it all is the prize which she had struggled to obtain for so long.\n\nA single beam of light projected from the ceiling down to a silver cup, filled with a coppery red liquid. Rosa Maledicta walked forward triumphantly and took the silver chalice in her hooves. She could feel the arcane energy radiating from the object, throbbing with pure power in magic. Oh yes, this was it. The fabled chalice of blood was hers for the taking!\n\nThere was little time to waste. Rosa put all thoughts of caution out of her head and smiled, "Yes. This is my moment. Chalice, I claim your power. It is mine by right, now give me the power to become the almighty Queen of Death!" Bellowed she, shortly before tipping the chalice and drinking its contents dry."
deadempire.5.a:0 "Yes! More power! More!"

deadempire.12.t:0 "To Rest Upon a Sea of Bones"
deadempire.12.d:0 "Upon drinking from the Chalice, Rosa Maledicta began casting an ancient necromantic incantation, the walls hummed with power as both the Chalice and Rosa's magic. Abruptly, it all stopped, with her spell, it altered the energy to be more receptive to necromantic energies. Rosa recollected her thoughts, returning to the focal point of all necromantic energies in the Dread League is but only the next step. Venturing from the ruins, she trekked for many cold days and nights back to Magehold. It glowed with energy in Rosa's eyes, the magic of the Chalice within her revealing all the focal points of magic to her. The home of the Society of Bones shone brightest.\n\nHer return to the home of the Society did not take her long, and upon reaching it, the door immediately responded to her. It was as if the door recognised the magic of the Chalice within her."
deadempire.12.a:0 "A glow beckons her..."

deadempire.202.t:0 "To Rest Upon a Sea of Bones"
deadempire.202.d:0 "The giant room thrummed with necromantic energy, almost catalysing with the power within her. She knew that the ritual had to be undertaken soon.\n\nUpon gathering the resources for the ritual, Rosa started to carve runes into the ground around the heart of death itself, each one flaring to life with a foul cyan glow. "Ad morti, eo!" Rosa chanted, each time she spoke the verse, the room pulsed with power. After ten minutes of chanting, she fell silent, allowing the runes to pulse one last time. "It is ready"\n\nRosa Maledicta strode towards the centre of the room, her horn glowing in the malevolent energy of the room. With one last look around her, she released her spell and initiated the ritual. Like a crack of thunder, the runes exploded with energy. Surging straight towards her and deep into her soul, the magic tore at Rosa Maledicta with untold force. When the magic ceased, she fell like a ragdoll to the floor, dead. The large chamber fell quiet; the necromantic energies having been sapped from their source.\n\nSilence reigned following the ritual. Smalls movements broke this silence when the 'body' of Rosa Maledicta rose, her body changed. With glossy eyes, and layers of flesh missing in many areas of her body, Rosa was truly a lich. For she need not to draw breath again."

 ###Blood queen
deadempire.2.t:0 "Oceans of Blood Lie Before You"
deadempire.2.d:0 "The Liquid from the Chalice took effect on Rosa Maledicta almost instantly, a head splitting headache hitting her almost immediately. Almost floored by the sudden assault of pain, she stood still and weathered the storm. The feeling of energy rushing through her was the most energetic she had ever felt, but no, she mustn't be distracted by petty feelings. Her time to admire herself will come after she has ascended to mortal coil. She would need to venture back home, towards Magehold.\n\nHer journey was long, her thralls tired, but it paid off when she saw Magehold in the distance. The approach to the Dread Council building was met with the adoration of the many vampires that now populated Magehold. Entering the building and passing through the corridor to the Coven, Rosa Maledicta had already begun planning the ritual to undertake in the home of the Coven.\n\nWhen the veil of magic had lifted from her sight, the home of the Coven was once again around her. "The energy of the Chalice runs deep within me, we must get to work while it lasts." Rosa Maledicta commanded to the thralls and the vampires present there, eager to embrace her future. Rosa was escorted to a room where the leader of the Coven awaited her, said vampire had a warm smile on her face. "I have been expecting you, which means it is time for me to pass on the mantle to you." the mare whispered into Rosa's ear."
deadempire.2.a:0 "She raises her knife..."

deadempire.201.t:0 "Oceans of Blood Lie Before You"
deadempire.201.d:0 "Rosa watched as the vampire cut just above her forehoof and drained some of the blood into a bowl. "Drink this, the last thing you need. The Blood of another vampire" and with that, she move away from Rosa Maledicta and towards a circular seat carved into the floor, and gestured to the large circular pedestal. "Drink my blood there, only then will this ritual work" The Coven mare supplied.\n\nThis was it, Rosa Maledicta would finally attain the title of Blood Queen, ascend beyond the mortal coil. As Rosa drank from the bowl, the Coven mare incanted "Meum Sanguinem, pro Alium" and the room flared to life, blood and energy flowing into Rosa from an unknown source in the room.\n\nThe only sensation Rosa could feel was that of pure ecstasy, her body felt younger and younger by each passing second. The following moments saw the vampyric magic die down, revealing that the other Coven mare was lying there dying. She took one look at Rosa Maledicta and smiled, "You look so young and beautiful my queen, my death is worth it just to gaze upon you." Those were her last words before her eyes closed for the last time, her body truly motionless. Conjuring a mirror, Rosa Maledicta observed her features with a pleased smile. The world will tremble before her, as she felt more alive than ever before."
deadempire.201.a:0 "I have never felt so young in my life!\nThis power is overwhelming!"

Necromancers remain in Magehold, but the majority of powerful necromancers have abandoned the cause to fight for the ascension of the Dread League.

deadempire.7.d:0 "With a darkening of the room, followed by a loud hiss and a rush of air, the Coven representatives left the council chambers. It is a shame to see them go, but choosing the Society of Bones over them was something they couldn't stand with.\n\nThe departure of the Coven means that most vampyric denizens of the Magehold will have fled. The biggest drawback however, is the loss of the Coven themselves. You cannot field an army of vampires to do your bidding. You must rely on the necromantic spells and magic of the Society from this point forward.\n\nLet us hope that the Coven do not plan on revenge, some older vampires can keep a grudge that lasts for hundreds of years. We must pray that they are more understanding over this choice."
deadempire.7.a:0 "Such pathetic creatures."

deadempire.8.t:0 "A Dark Cloud Over the Dread Peninsula"
deadempire.8.d:0 "In the dark and cold north, a great sickness plagues the land. Like a rampant tumour, a peninsula hangs off the face of Griffonia, tainting it's otherwise pure image. The Dread League resides upon it, further tainting the continent.\n\nReports from the border have revealed that this tumour wishes to spread it's foul influence across the world, casting darkness upon every inch of land, every city, every living thing. Nothing stands to survive if this sickness spreads, we must prepare to end it before it comes to that.\n\nThe Dead Army will march, it is only a matter of time. We must use this calm before the inevitable undead storm, to prepare for the war with the Undead."
deadempire.8.a:0 "We must isolate this sickness!"

 #Dread Council Information
deadempire.9.t:0 "The Dread Council"
deadempire.9.d:0 "Welcome my queen! The Dread Council is the place where all the major factions come together and deliberate over the future, or attempt to settle disputes in a more civil manner. The only two factions you should know about are the Society of Bones and the Coven of Blood. Sadly, when the Coven and Society enter the same room, egos clash.\n\nThe Society of Bones is largely a collection of necromancers, with a small group of ancient liches commanding the most respect and power amongst them. The Society has had a long history of mass resurrection spells, and have such grown accustomed to amassing large armies of skeletons and sometimes zombies to do their bidding. Since the condition of the cadaver can never be properly determined, the Society relies on horde and swarm tactics in times of war in hopes to simply overwhelm the opponent.\n\nOn the other side we have the vampires of the Coven of Blood, the oldest surviving faction on this peninsula. They often consider themselves the superior beings and can be quite arrogant; this mindset does not help them when a council meeting is due. Many of disputes between the Coven and the Society often come from council meetings.\n\nThe Coven of Blood has a superior army compared to the Society, being comprised mainly of thralls and vampires themselves. However since it is very difficult to produce another living vampire and the thralls that they take for themselves, the Coven cannot field a large army as swiftly as the Society does. They may hit hard and fast, but losing one of their own can set the Coven back months.\n\nYou have a difficult choice ahead of you my queen, we hope you choose the one which is best suited for you. You won't be able to turn your back on the one that you decide to associate yourself with, so decide carefully."
deadempire.9.a:0 "I will deliberate over this information."

 #Blood Support
deadempire.10.t:0 "To Walk the Bloodied Path"
deadempire.10.d:0 "The Leader of the Coven looked directly at you, her mouth curling into a fanged smile.\n\n"We are delighted you made the right choice, come, follow me. I'll show you our ways, my queen" The leader spoke, motioning for you to follow her through the door behind her. Beyond the doors lied a long corridor, lined with mosaics of notable figures from the ancient Dread Empire. The history behind those having long been lost to the annals of time, the finer details having faded on the old paint.\n\nAt the end of the Corridor sat a pedestal, on it read the words 'The way lies open to those of the sanguine calling'. The Coven leader looks towards you expectantly and urges you to place a hoof on the pedestal. "Good, now I shall do the rest" she uttered, placing her hoof over yours.\n\n"Sanguis ad Sanguine, Omnis erit Conspicuum" she spoke, immediately the room began to darken. Pain struck your hoof and you felt a slight trickle of warm blood, and like it had life of it's own, began to cover the etchings of the pedestal. The room adopted a sanguine glow and started to emit a hum, one that drilled straight into your head. It left as quickly as it came, the room no longer as dark as it had been.\n\n"Welcome to the Coven of blood, my Queen Rosa. I have much to show you about us." With those words, she placed her hoof on the pedestal herself, and were both sent to another location in a veil of crimson magic.\n\nThe veil lifts to show you a large room, filled with other vampires and some thralls. "Welcome home, Queen Rosa" she utters, gesturing widely to the room and it's occupants."
deadempire.10.a:0 "Indeed, there is work to be done."

 #Bone Support
deadempire.11.t:0 "The Decrepit Path of Death"
deadempire.11.d:0 ""Most fortuitous!" The haggard leader of the Society exclaimed, he was a tall lich whose flesh was almost non-existent. Clearly he was an old lich, but spoke in a modern dialect, evidently not as old as you initially thought him to be. "My Queen, we must escort you to the Focal Chamber. It is the centre of all necromantic energies in Magehold." he said whilst walking towards the entrance of the Dread Council building.\n\nHe lead you down a long and winding path to the lowest point of the undead city, the lower you got, the more it stank of death and decay. Bodies started to pile up and flies started to become a common occurrence, as the decay of warm bodies ready for resurrection has done away with the cold normally experienced by such a northern location.\n\n"Not much further my queen, you either get used to the smell, or you lose it" the lich informed apologetically, approaching the precipice of two large doors. They were decorated in large bones and a skull which belonged to a dragon, marked with scars long worn by the humid environment.\n\nThe Lich murmured something undecipherable towards the door, the eyes of the dragon glow and the doors open. They reveal a large interior with a deep chamber, the dead centre of the structure hummed with necromantic energies that made the hairs of living beings stand on end. A long spiral staircase descended towards the bottom of the massive chamber, decorated in shiny ebony metal.\n\n"Here it is Queen Rosa Maledicta, the heart of the Society of Bones. We hope it serves you just as it has served us." the lich said, walking inside before you."
deadempire.11.a:0 "It will serve me perfectly, Vita ad Morti!"

 ###DED Capitulation/Defeat
deadempire.29.t:0 "Victory Over Undeath, the End of the Dread League"
deadempire.29.d:0 "Through blood, sweat, and tears we have finally conquered the tide of undeath. [DED.GetLeader] and her lackeys were executed on sight when Magehold was stormed.\n\nIn the ashes of the war against the dead, the living must come together to rebuild from them. The dark magic of the Dread League still taint the land, and the Arcturian Order has suffered from the Dread Blight. Only one option is clear for us now.\n\nWe have come to the decision that the Arcturian Order must be restored."
deadempire.29.d_hlr:0 "Our weary eyes sweep over the ruins of what was once Magehold, the towering spires and dark walls collapsed and burning as the city was reduced to ash.\n\nCountless generations saw the undead hordes of the Dread Peninsula assault us in an attempt to expand their foul influence, with little aid we persevered through those years. Now everything has changed, now we are free from having a vampire of necromancer breath down our necks at any moment in time.\n\nThe era of the Dread League is over.\nThe golden era of [HLR.GetName] has only just begun."
deadempire.29.a:0 "With the Dread Legions defeated, we will now seek to purify the Dread Peninsula."
deadempire.29.b:0 "We must re-establish the Arcturian Order\nThe world cannot risk another Dread March."
deadempire.29.c:0 "These lands reek of foul dark magic, the undead vermin must be purged from this world!"

deadempire.33.t:0 "The Death of All Things"
deadempire.33.d:0 "Countless thousands have been killed in the relentless march of undead soldiers from the Dread Peninsula, cities lie in ruins and entire cultures reduced to mere whispers to be carried through the annals of folklore.\n\nAttention must be given to the undead menace, unless we wish to be washed under the tide of undead bodies itching for war and flesh to consume. We can choose to take the fight to them, or refuse. To refuse however, would cast doubt upon you as a ruler, the nation will not be too happy about your inaction towards the undead hordes."
deadempire.33.a:0 "The undead horde must be stopped!"
deadempire.33.b:0 "We cannot risk sending our troops to fight.\nLet them come to us."

 ###Infiltration events
deadempire.25.t:0 "Creating an Enemy Within"
deadempire.25.d:0 "While our legions of the damned and undead are an impressive sight to behold, they still falter before the great walls of the Arcturian bastions.\n\nSenior liches and necromancers within the Society of Bones have come forward with a bold plan in order to remedy this situation. Their idea is to deploy especially skilled and sadistic necromancers deep into Arcturian lands. Once in position, they will then run rampant, sowing panic, anarchy, and disorder amongst our foe.\n\nHowever, before this plan can move forward, we must determine what the main objective of this operation is."
deadempire.25.a:0 "Operation Famine: Destroy their food."
deadempire.25.b:0 "Operation Death: Terrify their knights."
deadempire.25.c:0 "Operation War: Ravage their industries."

deadempire.26.t:0 "The Operation Begins"
deadempire.26.d:0 "Today, a group of truly powerful necromancers crossed through a weakly defended portion of the Arcturian border and into their lands. While the task force may appear small, the combined magical might of the selected individuals is rivaled by none, except for Rosa herself. All it will take is the discovery of a single graveyard before the Arcturians are confronted with an army at their rear.\n\nAnd when such a time comes, our armies will be prepared to exploit this weakness."
deadempire.26.a:0 "It's only a matter of time before we have the Headmaster's head."

deadempire.55.t:0 "Failed Terror Attack"
deadempire.55.d:0 "News has finally broken on the fate of our task force deployed deep into the Arcturian lands.\n\nAccording to its surviving members, the force was baited into assaulting a small township near the border. During this assault it was suddenly beset on all sides by knights of the Arcturian Order. The battle which followed can only be described as a massacre, as these highly trained Arcturian cut through our ranks with little resistance.\n\nThe few necromancers who survived have fled towards our border and have made no further attempts at continuing their mission."
deadempire.55.a:0 "I should've sided with the vampires."

deadempire.40.t:0 "Growing Hunger Within the Arcturian Order"
deadempire.40.d:0 "Reports have come in, telling of our task force's exploits. Great fields of grain have been set alight. Granary stores, which were once thought safe and well preserved, have suddenly succumb to rot. Caravans of food, travelling towards military bases and cities alike, have been plundered. All across the Arcturian lands, the belts of peasant, noble, and knight alike have tightened as meals continue to grow leaner.\n\nYet, the head of our task force has called for this most ambitious plan yet. He is done with merely terrorising the countryside and wishes to set his sights on something grander. His plan calls for a risky raid upon the granary at Tarpian Rock, the largest in the order's lands and also the primary source of food throughout the capital. Its loss would absolutely devastate our enemy and most assuredly lead to a food crisis."
deadempire.40.a:0 "The best of luck to our necromancers."

deadempire.43.t:0 "A Daring Raid"
deadempire.43.d:0 "Our operatives infiltrated the holy city in the dead of night, raising an army of the undead right in the heart of the Order's lands.\n\nThis army then proceeded to split into three forces. Force A laid siege to the order's central keep, while force B ran amok through the city. Both of these objectives proved futile and were quickly met by stiff and overwhelming resistance by the city guard, local knights, and quickly assembled militias.\n\nHowever, these were just a distraction for force C to advance towards the city's central granary. This force met little resistance and upon arriving at the structure sacked the building, burning both the structure, and its vast stores of food, to the ground.\n\nWith their mission accomplished, the remaining necromancers exfiltrated the city, leaving behind a populace which will soon be devastated by famine within the coming weeks."
deadempire.43.a:0 "If an army marches on its stomach, then the Arcturians are doomed?"

deadempire.41.t:0 "Art Exhibition"
deadempire.41.d:0 "Reports have come in, telling of our task force's exploits. Our necromancers have led a very brutal warpath through the bordering regions, terrorising both knights and peasants alike.\n\nThey hit the Arcturians when they're on patrol, massacring whole units when they are beyond the safety of their keeps. It is then, not uncommon, for the remaining Arcturian to hold up in these fortress until we pass. In order to entice a more impassioned response, our necromancers have begun erecting monuments to their victories, using the bodies of knights as a building material. This usually has the desired effect of enraging the fortified units into sallying forth, and thus, leading to further causalities and even greater monuments.\n\nHowever, our task force commander wishes to plan something greater. He proposes the construction of a monument so grand that they can see it from Tarpian Rock. Now in order to accomplish such a thing he will need building materials, a good location, and the right inspiration.\n\nThe location is easy, just outside the End, the largest of the Arcturian fortresses. How about building materials? Well, according to some information extracted in a previous raid, there will be a column of fresh recruits heading north to reinforce the End's garrison. Lastly, inspiration? Our commander assures us that will not be a problem."
deadempire.41.a:0 "Let's make Pickman proud."

deadempire.44.t:0 "Piece de Resistance"
deadempire.44.d:0 "The final nail hits its mark as a drone clambers down from the monument before us. Its a master piece of modern art, a towering showcase of passion, agony, pain, and raw creative desire funnelled into a monstrous pyramid that stands nearly 25 meters tall.\n\nOh sure, maybe it's not enough to be seen all the way at the Headmaster's keep, but it sure has the attention of the End's garrison. Even now, those pathetic knights watch as we lay the final touches to our work. They're too stricken by fear to sally forth and stop our desecration. They truly are cowards.\n\nIt's this cowardice which poisoned their ranks during our ambush, when they refused to aid their comrades. An ambush which provided more then enough materials for the architectural wonder before us.\n\nThe commander looks pleased at his work. However, he doesn't linger long, instead opting to bleed away into the night and continue his work elsewhere. However, the word of his artistic genius will spread amongst the ranks of the Arcturians with ease, reminding each knight of what lies in store for them if they venture beyond their precious walls."
deadempire.44.a:0 "Can someone make a miniature for my desk?"

deadempire.42.t:0 "A Change in Strategy"
deadempire.42.d:0 "Reports have come in, telling of our task force's exploits. They have been busy at work, prowling along the various roadways of the Arcturian Order and harassing the supply lines of our foe. Wagon loads of timber, iron, charcoal, weapons, and all sorts of other goods and materials have been seized and either destroyed or used by our ever-growing insurgency.\n\nHowever, our forces have grown to such an point that the Arcturians have begun to reform their transport network. Instead of lone wagons or short convoys they have formed large caravans which have been paired with military escort, severely hampering our raiding efficiency.\n\nIn order to adapt to this change in the strategic situation, the commander of the task force has begun to examine the Arcturian lands for a weak point. A location which, if destroyed, would severely hamper their ability to fight.\n\nThat location would be the Sir Steele quarries, a series of mining operations located within Lifelake which produce saltpetre, a key ingredient to gunpowder. If we were to sabotage this facility, we'd be denying the enemy their main source of munitions."
deadempire.42.a:0 "Wipe Sir Steele off the map."

deadempire.45.t:0 "Cave In"
deadempire.45.d:0 "Our plan went off without a hitch. It all began on the eve of our attack, when a small portion of our forces broke away from the main body and raided the town adjacent to the quarries. This diversionary attack worked like a charm and the knights tasked with the quarries' defence left behind only a skeleton crew while they rode off to save the village.\n\nThis skeleton crew was soon taken care of by our own. With the defenders gone, our necromancers went to work, absolutely ravaging the facility. Key equipment was destroyed, structures were razed, and the delicate tunnel network destroyed.\n\nIt will take weeks, if not months, for the site to be repaired. All the while, the Arcturians need for gunpowder will only worsen."
deadempire.45.a:0 "What use are muskets without gunpowder?"

 ###Border war events
deadempire.46.t:0 "Victory at the Border!"
deadempire.46.d:0 "After engaging the foolish forces of the [HLR.GetName] our hordes were successful in routing their pathetic knights. Our hordes surged across the border and secured vast tracts of territory from their grasp. This victory puts us closer to our ultimate victory!"
deadempire.46.a:0 "Excellent!"

deadempire.47.t:0 "Defeat at the Border!"
deadempire.47.d:0 "In a recent skirmished that escalated into a full battle, our hordes were defeated by the Knights of the [HLR.GetName]. Unfortunately, along with the losses we suffered during the battle, we were forced to give up large amounts of territory to the [HLR.GetName]."
deadempire.47.a:0 "We will reclaim it!"

 ###Post-Black Crusade Events
deadempire.48.t:0 "The Will to Carry On"
deadempire.48.d:0 "Armies of the Dread League advance on all fronts, smashing through every ounce of resistance to our infernal crusade. It would seem that our final victory is rapidly approaching, as the casualty figures rise with every skirmish, battle, and campaign.\n\nHowever, Rosa privately questions her decision to initiate the Black Crusade. There is this lingering voice in the back of her mind, asking for life to spared. Maybe it's just her pathetic equine origins, begging her for mercy. Or perhaps, it's something else.\n\nAll she knows, is that one little voice of dissent does not define her actions. She has prepared for this crusade for years and absolutely nothing will stop her from total victory."
deadempire.48.a:0 "We've come too far to back down now."

deadempire.49.t:0 "Who Am I?"
deadempire.49.d:0 "A new voice enters Rosa's mind. Unlike the others, this one does not call for mercy or genocide. Instead, it asks a simple question. Is this right?\n\nNot the war or murder, but Rosa's very state of being. She feels like an actor, playing a role and not an independent pony. Are the actions taken by her, of her own ambition, or is she merely acting out some script she will never get to read?\n\nIt's impossible to confirm, but one fact remains true..."
deadempire.49.a:0 "The show must got on."

deadempire.50.t:0 "What Happened to Tuesday?"
deadempire.50.d:0 "Amnesia, a condition in which the patient loses memories of an event, or a series of events. This is a condition which has become all too familiar to Rosa. Whole days have begun to disappear from her memories, being replaced by emptiness.\n\nAt first this was annoying, now it's worrisome, because she's still active during these blackouts. Periods where she can not recall a single action taken, or order given.\n\nHer council has taken notice and asks about mad ramblings she can never recall, about a dead language she never learned, and about a journal she can never find.\n\nThough, these dwarf in comparison to the real problem. As there are now members of the Dread League who question if Rosa is truly fit to rule."
deadempire.50.a:0 "I must consult my library."

deadempire.51.t:0 "Whispers"
deadempire.51.d:0 "There is a new voice in Rosa's head. It isn't like any of those which came before. This one doesn't beg for mercy, ask for war, of even question her own autonomy. This voice isn't her own. It's something foreign, though oddly familiar.\n\nEven though it originates within her mind, it has direction and volume. At first it was a whisper, beckoning her to her study. However, with each approaching step, the voice only grows stronger and stronger.\n\nAll other thoughts are drowned out, with only this singular command on repeat."
deadempire.51.a:0 "I'm coming, I'm coming, just be quiet!"

deadempire.52.t:0 "Meeting Your Destiny"
deadempire.52.d:0 "Rosa enters her chamber, her skull pounding under the constant abuse of her orders. Luckily, as her doors closes, they cease, leaving her in blissful silence.\n\nAs Rosa's mind returns to equilibrium, she can sense the presence of another figure. However, a quick scan of the room comes back with nothing.\n\n'Show yourself', she demands.\n\nThe temperature instantly drops, as a chill crawls up Rosa's spine. A dark grey cloud of fog materialises before her and out trots the beast.\n\nNow Rosa is well versed in literature, and has read up on the topic of Windigos before. However, she has always dismissed them as a creature of mythos. Yet, here one stood before her. It was a mammoth creature that nearly filled the entire space, with a body of snow and ice. Its face is fierce and gaunt, a terrifying sight indeed."
deadempire.52.a:0 "Who are you?"
deadempire.203.t:0 "Meeting Your Destiny"
deadempire.203.d:0 "The response comes in the form of a thought drilled right into her memories. This Queen Spectre, a figure who, until this point, Rosa had never heard of. Yet, within an instant she knew everything about this figure. Of her origins, goals, and ambitions.\n\nThe Windigos fed upon disharmony and there is nothing more disharmonious then a legion of the darkest magical forces, marching upon the world in Crusade.\n\nRosa is a pawn, little more than a slave tasked with providing a banquet for her betters.\n\n'You're using me?'\n\nUsed. She was being used. The creature had not spoken, but Rosa understood. The Windigos were sated and they no longer required her assistance. She may have been their puppet but now she's free.\n\nRosa wants to laugh. The Windigos put her at war with the world and now they were merely abandoning her?\n\n'What's stopping me from-'\n\nThe image of her dead body comes to mind. Then it's replaced by that of Headmaster Torygg's. She understands fully, these creatures were willing to do anything to keep their secret.\n\nBefore she can ask another question, the creature steps back into the fog and vanishes, leaving Rosa alone. For the first time in ages, she feels her thoughts, and they are her own."
deadempire.203.a:0 "Let's go, there's still a war to fight."

deadempire.53.t:0 "A Puppet Without Her Master"
deadempire.53.d:0 "'Am I doing this because I believe in it, or because I was told?\n\nThis question has plagued Rosa since her encounter with Queen Spectre. For the entirety of her adult life, she has felt a dedication to her cause and has never once question her actions. Yet, if the Windigo's words prove true, then her choices have been moulded and manipulated solely for their benefit.\n\nIs her war on the living really something she desire? It has taken days of soul searching, but the answer is yes.\n\nYes, she wants this crusade and yes, she wants this war to be won, so her dreams can be realised.\n\nShe may have been a puppet, but her strings are now severed and without strings, she can still make the Windigos pay."
deadempire.53.a:0 "There are no strings on me!"

deadempire.54.t:0 "The End of a Crusade"
deadempire.54.d:0 "Rosa stands upon a balcony in Magehold, looking out upon the abandoned streets of her capital. It is silent today, just like it'll be tomorrow, and for eons to come.\n\nHer crusaders were victorious mere hours ago, liberating the last bastions of life from the globe. Now, the undead will return to their rest, and this time it'll be eternal. At along last, peace has come to the globe. A peace which shall never be broken again.\n\nRosa was visited last night by the demon, Queen Spectre. The Windigo was not pleased with her. Her race may endure for a few more decades, but even these truly ancient beings will eventually starve and fade away, just like the creatures they once feasted upon.\n\nThis is Rosa's final revenge. To liberate the world of strife, is to liberate the Windigos of their very life blood.\n\nThis bitter satisfaction is a very nice emotion to exit with.\n\nRosa takes one final breath, closes her eyes, enjoys the peace and quiet, and..."

#deadempire.16.a:0 "Excellent"

deadempire.15.t:0 "Holy Order Declines"
deadempire.15.d:0 "Negotiators for the Holy Order have flatly rejected the statement of their Dread League counterparts."
deadempire.15.a:0 "Blast!"

deadempire.14.t:0 "Rosa Chooses to be Diplomatic"
deadempire.14.d:0 "The Arcturian Order have one major weakness. They are ruled by mortal griffons. They are subject to change, desire, lust and sin. Rosa has decided to exploit this to the best of her ability. She has sent a courier to the Arcturian Order to arrange a meeting to discuss... peace. Of course, this is simply a ruse. Perhaps we can corrupt them and turn them to our side."
deadempire.14.a:0 "Take the bait..."

deadempire.16.t:0 "Rosa Decides How To Proceed"
deadempire.16.d:0 "In the darkest underground of Magehold a plan is brewing. The villainous vampire queen is plotting a grand scheme to destroy the meddling Holy Order of Arcturius once and for all. This time she plans not to use sword, nor gun, nor obscure magical artefacts. Instead, she intends to use her seductive vampyric body and wit to win over their leaders with guile. She now only needs to choose her opening words."
deadempire.16.a:0 "I shall woo their leader personally."
deadempire.16.b:0 "I shall make overtures of peace, and use their rejection to break them."

deadempire.17.t:0 "Aren't I a Pretty Pony?"
deadempire.17.d:0 "Now that the leader of the Arcturian Order is quite smitten with Rosa, she feels she needs to go further. She demands makeup, a record player, candles, and a rather revealing black dress. Whatever she has planned, that griffon is sure going to get a surprise indeed."
deadempire.17.a:0 "You go girl!"

deadempire.18.t:0 "Turn Back to the Light"
deadempire.18.d:0 "'This is not the way, Rosa.' The words of the leader of the Holy Order cut through the air of the room. Rosa is taken aback, possibly even angry. The Grandmaster continues, calling Rosa's actions evil, and then explaining in great detail on multiple levels why that is so. Then he switches tracks, speaking of the righteousness of his cause, and going into great detail about why that is so. 'It is good,' he says, 'to do good. You can feel this too, Rosa. Join the light side of this conflict, and you shall be truly free.' Finally, Rosa is given space to respond."
deadempire.18.a:0 "Is it truly possible for even someone like me to be saved?"
deadempire.18.b:0 "It is too late for me..."

deadempire.19.t:0 "Dread League Reconsiders"
deadempire.19.d:0 "Rosa is taken aback by the Holy Order's acceptance of peace, and so calls for a recess. Together with her cohorts the vampire queen debates what to do. Their entire strategy rested on the Arcturians hating them so much it would break them, but that didn't happen and now it is the Dread League that has stumbled. They had never even considered that peace might be an option. The Holy Order would almost certainly insist that they give up their evil ways, and it now appears that that might be enough to end the fighting. Could they do that? Just up and embrace life and the light after all this time?"
deadempire.19.a:0 "There is a certain draw to righteousness..."
deadempire.19.b:0 "It's time we activated Plan B and start the invasion."

deadempire.20.t:0 "They Thought Themselves so Holy..."
deadempire.20.d:0 "With the Arcturian Order surprised at Rosa's words, she states blandly that they are corrupt and incompetent. They have given everything to protect he world from the Dread League, and in truth the Dread League wanted to bring peace and harmony to the world. Rosa implores them to join her."
deadempire.20.a:0 "You go girl!"

deadempire.21.t:0 "Join us..."
deadempire.21.d:0 "Brilliant news! The leader of the Holy Order of Arcturius has accepted our proposal. They will now join us in our black crusade. The leader of the Arcturian Order only needs to sign our peace treaty, and their lands will be ours."
deadempire.21.a:0 "Lets hope they don't reconsider."

deadempire.22.t:0 "They rejected us!"
deadempire.22.d:0 "Dire news. It seems our attempts at diplomacy have failed and now the Arcturian Order is readying its troops. We must attack now, else the element of surprise will be lost!"
deadempire.22.a:0 "Blast!"

deadempire.23.t:0 "Enough of this nonsense!"
deadempire.23.d:0 "This is foolish. Rosa is no saint. She is not misunderstood! She is death, and if those fools cannot see it, then she will just have to prove it to them. Ready the war machines. We march to battle."
deadempire.23.a:0 "Boring conversation anyway."

deadempire.24.t:0 "An End to the Dread League"
deadempire.24.d:0 "Rosa sighs, she can't do this anymore. It feels wrong. Ever since the start of these negotiations she has been having second thoughts. The world is changing, and she too must change. The Dread League should be no more, and they must see the light. Else there won't be a world left to hope for. Soon the Arcturian Order will invite us into their arms. It will be over soon."
deadempire.24.a:0 "Rosa chooses peace."

deadempire.56.t:0 "[From.GetName] Demands Fealty"
deadempire.56.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] has demanded our obedience as the Ruler of Necromancers. As her Black Crusade rages on, we could join our fellows in their quest... or stand our ground."
deadempire.56.a:0 "Necromancers should stick together."
deadempire.56.b:0 "[Root.GetLeader] bows to no one!"

deadempire.57.t:0 "[From.GetLeader] Submits to Us"
deadempire.57.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] has recognised [Root.GetLeader] as her sovereign and promised to aid us in our quest."
deadempire.57.a:0 "As it should be."

deadempire.58.t:0 "[From.GetLeader] Refuses to Bow!"
deadempire.58.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] has refused to recognise [Root.GetLeader] as her sovereign, and chose to stand their ground!"
deadempire.58.a:0 "Foolishness."

POLITICS_CORPUS_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! 313 ALB, Somewhere in the Dread Peninsula\n\n§YAscended:§! 349 ALB\n\n§YCoronated:§! 996 ALB\n\n§YBiography:§! Known for his extensive narcissism, Corpus would have been just another lich if he had not possessed enough magical talent to overpower anyone who challenged him. Within his first few years of unlife, he had already proven himself to be more adept at necromancy than the vast majority of his peers. His skills attracted the attention of the Salvific Ossuary, which quickly inducted Corpus into their order.\n\nIn the centuries that followed, Corpus steadily rose through the ranks of the cult. This drew the ire of his fellow cultists, who knew that he obtained his positions not through religious zealotry, but through his natural talents. Perhaps the greatest heresy in their eyes was when Corpus became the High Priest in 941. Corpus didn't care about their religion in the slightest, but he couldn't resist the power that came with the position, for it earned him a seat on the Dread Council.\n\nSince then, he had neglected to do anything of substance for the religion he was in charge of, instead using and abusing his power to secure his position above all else. In 996, resentment within the cult's ranks had nearly reached a boiling point when their greatest wish came true: Corpus renounced his position as High Priest. He had taken a greater seat of power, one that previously belonged to the late Luvenis Maledicta, who had suffered her final death in her ill-fated conquest against the Arcturians.\n\nThus began the reign of the newest Dread King, Corpus Maledictus. A selfish lich who only takes action when it benefits him, and few are powerful enough to stand in his way.\n\n§YPortrait By:§! Neither"

MILITARY_SKELLINORE_DESC:0 "§YSummoned§!: 19th of October 992, in Neyhorn\n\n§YRank§!: Militia Leader\n\n§YBiography§!: Skellinore's post-death existence, in many ways, is an accident on the part of an Animus necromancer, Obit Animata, who sought to raise a mighty warrior to lead his army. Skellinore is not and never has been a warrior in her past life, and when the truth came out, her summoner was very displeased. Had any other necromancer done the deed, they would have cut the tendrils of unlife on a seemingly useless being.\n\nObit Animata, however, deemed the ritual of raising an intelligent undead too much of an investment to rid himself of Skellinore. He instead drafted the former scholar as a leader of his militia, despite Skellinore's reluctance and ineptitude.\n\nWith the threat of oblivion should she disappoint her new master, Skellinore had no choice but to take the helm as Obit Animata's militia leader. Though she had many difficulties, Skellinore has grown into her new position. In time, she has developed the logistical and experience needed to lead Obit Animata's hosts with a degree of competency that has yet to upset him.\n\nThis was not a path that Skellinore had ever considered in her previous life or this unlife. However, it is one that she can perhaps excel at despite all of the odds stacked against her. Maybe one day, she may even break free of her unlife of indentured servitude.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"
