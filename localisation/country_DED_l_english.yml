DED_START_council:0 "Another Day at the Helm"
DED_START_council_desc:0 "For centuries the Dread Council has held meetings to discuss recent happenings or issues in or around the Dread Peninsula. Though the late Luvenis Maledicta had proven our ability to put a dent into the armour of those fanatical knights, Corpus has yet to take advantage of the plundered land. Despite being repeatedly pestered by the council to press our benefit, he remains complacent with our current position."

DED_START_magehold:0 "Within the Well of Knowledge"
DED_START_magehold_desc:0 "The Magisterium has been a center of learning ever since The Library had been discovered. Many within were surprised to hear the announcement about the Third Seal and are eager to hear Vetus' opinion on the matter, should he be lucid enough to give one."

DED_START_Dominus:0 "Whispers Under the Pines' Shades"
DED_START_Dominus_desc:0 "In command of House Dominus is one of the most influential vampires within the Dread Peninsula: The elusive Count Dominus. Known for prying into others' business, the sudden announcement came as a surprise to him and his cabal. Perhaps an internal discussion on the matter is in order..."

DED_START_Concors:0 "The Court of the Twin Rulers"
DED_START_Concors_desc:0 "House Concors has remained the most stable clan of vampires for almost a millenia, despite constant internal strife. It is known for its core philosophy: Limited "free will" for their thralls. As the representative of the Concors Twins, Baron Greten knows more than anygriff that Corpus' proclamation is worth disturbing his masters for, even if it means having to suffer through their hedonistic chambers."

DED_START_Ruber:0 "The Crimson Mare's Progeny" 
DED_START_Ruber_desc:0 "Aside from the Progenitor, Lady Rubra is the oldest living vampire in the known world. She and her clan command the fiercest of thralls and, as they claim, the strongest bloodline. Those within House Rubra have always supported the Dread Council. Still, some wonder what Corpus' announcement might mean for their future."

DED_START_Aeternum:0 "The Stitchers' Dream"
DED_START_Aeternum_desc:0 "Those who subscribe to the beliefs of Aeternum are often the most open to new ideas and change. With the recent announcement from Corpus, these eccentric necromancers have gone wild with speculation as to what new forms of magic might await them and their undead monstrosities."

DED_START_Animus:0 "The Beauty of Undeath"
DED_START_Animus_desc:0 "Raising a corpse isn't just a spell, it's an art form. Necromancers in the Animus Center pride themselves on their semi-autonomous undead, often showcasing how most of their intelligence can be retained after death. Some are wondering if the recent announcement could lead into a deeper understanding of reanimation."

DED_START_Potentia:0 "The Purity of Desire"
DED_START_Potentia_desc:0 "It is no secret that the Cult of [POTENTIA RENAME] is reviled by the other necromancers, yet these mad mages do not seem to care. What do others know of power? The only way to become a true necromancer is to devote oneself to [THEIR GOD]. Because of this, they are seen as the laughing stock of the League. Perhaps the Third Seal may be the key to regaining their glory?"

DED_START_Seal:0 "The Magnum Opus of Corpus Maledictus"
DED_START_Seal_desc:0 "As the clock strikes twelve, liches, vampires, and mages of all kinds begin to gather for what Corpus has heralded as the dawn of a new age for the Dread League. Whether he will actually be able to make good on his words is another story, however."

dread_start.11.t:0 "Another Day in the Dread Council"
dread_start.11.d:0 "The meeting began as any other, with pointless bickering and groaning. The seven members of the Dread Council sat around one another at an obsidian table decorated with ancient runes used by the first necromancers. Among them were three vampires, two liches, and two still-living mages. There was an eighth seat larger than the others, but the dust layering its rugged cushion betrayed how often it was used.\n\nIt had been two years since Corpus had stopped showing up to the Dread Council's annual meetings, and three more since he had stopped listening to their advice altogether. This had left the council to focus mainly on each other's faults and shortcomings since they could no longer count on Corpus to settle matters within the Dread League. There were a few things that they could agree on, however: their mutual dislike for Corpus Maledictus.\n\nWhy do we even bother with these meetings if Corpus isn't going to show up?" grumbled a furious lich by the name of Lux Tenebris, "Wasn't the point of them to counsel the current Maledictus?"\n\nMost of the other council members murmured in agreement. The League hadn't managed to accomplish much lately, and their tenuous grasp over [THE PASSAGE] wasn't being properly exploited. There were still pockets of unclaimed peasants left, even after ten years of controlling their land! Corpus had neglected to divide the spoils amongst the Dread Council, and thus they never did settle on an agreement for what to do with the area.\n\nSoon arguments turned back towards differing opinions on how to handle the "Arcturian Menace" that had been bothering them for the past millennium. Many were in agreement that something needed to be done, but none could agree on a proper strategy to combat those wretched knights.\n\nAs the hours went on with countless quarrels going unresolved, two representatives from the vampire clans rose from their seats, not wanting to waste their time any further. As they announced their intention to leave, a loud creak could be heard across the room. All heads turned to see an elegantly robed lich step through the door."
dread_start.11.a:0 ""I apologize for being late.""

dread_start.12.t:0 "The Dread King's Announcement"
dread_start.12.d:0 ""LATE?! You believe yourself to be merely late?!" screeched Lady Rubra, the eldest of the vampire lords. Beside her stood Count Dominus and Baron Greten. They seemed equally furious; the former was coldy staring down Corpus while the latter clenched his claws to restrain himself.\n\nOn the other side of the room, a mortal unicorn rose from his seat. "If it's all the same to you, I would like to return to my work. I have nearly finished my latest creation."\n\nAn elderly lich by the name of Timor Virtute raised a hoof to his associate, "Magnus, your 'creation' can wait. Perhaps Corpus has a good reason to be here today." Timor shifted his gaze towards the indifferent Dread King, "Or perhaps he does not."\n\nLux Tenebris, despite her grandstanding disposition as the High Priestess of [POTENTIA RENAME] remained silent, but her hatred could be felt emanating off of her bones.\n\nTutor Libra, the only council member not affiliated with the necromancers or vampires, merely sighed.\n\nCorpus leisurely walked over to his chair, magically dusted it off, then sat upon it. "I have an important announcement for you all today."\n\nBaron Greten scoffed, "An announcement? What of the ongoing issues that we've been trying-"\n\n"I assure you my good Baron," interrupted Corpus, "that what I am going to do will fix most, if not all of those issues." Corpus' horn ignited, the swirl of his sickly green aura permeating throughout the central table. After a moment, it seemed to construct a glowing replica of the Library of Magehold. "As you all know, the Library is the source of our knowledge and power. For aeons it has held countless tomes and scrolls of ancient knowledge, but most of it was held behind the Great Seals. Over a thousand years ago, our esteemed Librarian Vetus Maledictus broke two of these Great Seals, granting us the powers of Lichdom and Vampirism."\n\nLady Rubra rolled her eyes in annoyance, "Some of us were there, remember? Get to the point."\n\n"My friends, I am going to break open the Third Great Seal.""
dread_start.12.a:0 "He's going to do what?"

dread_start.2.t:0 "The Magisterium's Keeper"
dread_start.2.d:0 "Ornate candles illuminated the chambers of the Library of Magehold. Many scholars and mages could be seen roaming the halls, studying and organizing the carefully preserved tomes that numbered in the tens of thousands.\n\nOne scholar in particular was trotting through the halls in a hurry, however. Wearing the signature robe that indicated membership of the Dread Council, Tutor Libra was seeking out the oldest creature in the Dread League: Vetus Maledictus. She needed to consult the ancient lich regarding the proclamation of Corpus.\n\nTutor passed by a pair of mages examining one of the many magical seals blocking off sections of the Library. Though a significant number of minor seals had been broken by Vetus, some even by other mages, countless more still hide vast sections of the Library. The place was already a maze to begin with; each month, the maps needed to be updated with newly accessible areas.\n\nShe had a hunch of where to find Vetus, though. Tutor made her way to the grand spiral staircase that separated the major sections of the Library. As she descended, she saw a magnificent white glow from below. When she reached the bottom, she saw a lone, hooded figure standing in front of the glimmering magical barrier. The Third Great Seal. Beyond it was... who knows? Something comparable to the power of liches and vampires, that's for sure.\n\nTutor cleared her throat, stepping forward, "Vetus, I bring news. Corpus intends to breach the next Great Seal, and, well... I would like to know your thoughts on that."\n\nIf the hooded figure heard her, it didn't seem to acknowledge it. Tutor was about to clear her throat again when she heard Vetus' old, decrepit voice murmur something. She couldn't quite make out his words, so she stepped closer. "Vetus? Did you hear me?"\n\nThe figure turned towards her, revealing a withered husk of a stallion. Dried flesh and piercing yellow eyes bored into her, sending shivers up her spine. Vetus Maledictus then returned his gaze to the barrier, murmuring, "Time is approaching its end, and only one will be able to see it. The mare and the wind will battle, and death itself will die. Then the future will be certain.""

dread_start.21.t:0 "Musings Of The Librarian"
dread_start.21.d:0 "Vetus Maledictus stood by one of the many bookshelves within the Magisterium. He had read them all before, but could not recall what was inside any of them. Many mages passed by him, some even stopping to offer a modicum of gratitude for granting them the power they now possessed. He paid them no mind, though. Something was troubling him, and he was having a difficult time figuring out what it was.\n\nIt had been over a millenia since he had first stepped hoof into this place; he had brought the curse of Lichdom to those who called it a gift, and when more ponies begged for the power to fight back against the undead, he cursed them with eternal life. The two Great Seals which held those powers had been explored thoroughly, yet more was being discovered each year. Perhaps in time, they may uncover the secret within the Third Great Seal.\n\nOne thing didn't change, though. Everyone who sought power in Magehold ended up corrupted, power-hungry, or downright evil. Rarely did an aspiring mage or other creature last more than a year without succumbing to the darkness of this harrowing realm.\n\nHowever...\n\nVetus gazed at one mage among the crowd, a young mare who was studiously reading one of many books on necromancy. There was something about her that bothered him. He'd seen her plenty of times before, but she never seemed to change. Maybe she was different?"
dread_start.21.a:0 "Perhaps..."

dread_start.3.t:0 "The Opulent Lord of Secrets"
dread_start.3.d:0 "The grand manor belonging to House Dominus was unusually silent today. Not to say that it wasn't typically quiet, but every vampire within its corridors seemed extremely unnerved. They were right to be: Count Dominus was meeting with his most trusted spy ring, an elite group of vampires known for succeeding where many other aspiring spies failed: slipping past the border into the territory of the Arcturian Order and beyond. And if all of them had been recalled here, then something big must be happening.\n\nWithin the clandestine chamber lounged several vampires, awaiting orders from their Count. He sat in his chair, brooding and unmoving. He was known to remain still for hours at a time, something that put almost everyone near him on edge.\n\nJust as one vampire opened her mouth to say something, Count Dominus rose from his chair, silencing her before she even began. "Corpus intends to break the Third Seal, my brethren."\n\nNaught but stillness came from the spy ring. The Count continued, "Though I have my doubts on his ability to follow through on this proclamation, we must prepare for the possibility that he does succeed. That is what the rest of our clan will deal with. You all, on the other hoof," he stepped towards the map on the central table, placing his hoof upon the section of the Dread Peninsula indicating Magehold, "There are some within our very land who would seek to take advantage of this opportunity. If anyone makes plans regarding Corpus or the Dread Council, I will be the first to know. Understood?""
dread_start.3.a:0 "The other vampires nodded, then faded away into the darkness."

dread_start.4.t:0 "Frater et Sororis"
dread_start.4.d:0 "The deepest chamber of House Concors plays a unique role within the Coven of Blood: It is a place where vampires can choose to send their enthralled to mingle with one another and be allowed complete and total freedom, so long as they do not abuse this privilege. The other clans scorned this idea, but the Concors Twins were difficult to argue with. This became more apparent shortly after Corpus took the throne; the Twins retreated into their chamber, refusing to leave for any reason. Ever since then, they've spent their days engaged with the enthralled of other vampires as if they were their equals.\n\nThis was where Baron Greten found himself now. He gazed at the grand wooden doors that were ornately crafted to show several ponies, some of which were painted red, holding hooves in a circle around one another. He sighed as he opened the door. He enjoyed his position as representative of the Concors Twins, but some days were more difficult for him than others. The curse of Vampirism did not treat griffons well. \n\nImmediately he was assaulted with the scent of hundreds of living ponies and griffons. He had to restrain himself as he entered the grand chamber. The Concors Twins were at the very center, no doubt sharing hedonistic stories with the mortals around them. Baron Greten made his way through the crowd, making his presence known by coughing loudly. The brother-sister duo in charge of House Concors ceased their storytelling, then turned their attention to their approaching representative.\n\nBaron Greten wasted no time in getting straight to the point. "Corpus says he's going to open the Third Seal."\n\nThe Twins nodded. "Let us know when he is about to begin the process," they spoke simultaneously, "And we will be there to witness it.""
dread_start.4.a:0 "Without another word, they returned to telling stories."

dread_start.5.t:0 "The Crimson Mare"
dread_start.5.d:0 "The lush, extravagant manor belonging to the elite of House Rubra was one of the most difficult places to earn entry into. Lady Rubra was very particular about the guests that she allowed inside, and for good reason: The interior held the finest decor in the entire Dread Peninsula.\n\nIn centuries past, Lady Rubra had undergone some expeditions to "acquire" some of the fancier furnishings, rugs, paintings, and so forth from the undomesticated mortals of the world. Savage brutes they were, though she had to admit that sometimes they could produce exquisite works of art. She took a sip from her champagne glass, then wiped her mouth clean of the red fluid it contained.\n\n"Disgusting." she expressed with a wretched tone. "Winters, fetch me a new bottle. Something high-grade."\n\nA young stallion wearing a butler's outfit approached her with the utmost respect. "Right away, Madam." He quickly retrieved the bottle, glass, and the blood-stained napkin, then began to make his way towards the cellar.\n\nLady Rubra thought back to Corpus' announcement from the other day. She loathed having to deal with such an uncivilized moron, but perhaps there was an opportunity to take advantage of. If the Third Seal held a great power, then perhaps it might be worth making nice with that uncouth brute for the time being.\n\nShe smiled. Her bloodline had always been the purest, and her progeny knew it. The power within the Third Seal would be hers, and if she had to play nice to get it, then there was nobody she wouldn't sink her teeth into."
dread_start.5.a:0 ""Winters, what is taking you so long!?""

dread_start.6.t:0 "The Mad Doctor"
dread_start.6.d:0 "As Magnus Medicus returned to his personal workshop, he took a moment to ponder the implications of what Corpus had said. If the Third Great Seal was truly about to be opened, then it would be prudent to let the other stitchers of Aeternum know to be ready for a wealth of incoming knowledge. Who knows? There might be new methods for reanimation that they could apply to their various creations. In any case, Magnus needed to prepare his thoughts to present to the other stitchers, and he knew just how to focus his mind.\n\nMagnus sat down on a stool next to a bloodied table. Donning an equally bloodied lab coat borrowed from his brief tenure at the University of Gamia, he set to work on his latest project: an intact pony corpse with an extra four legs surgically attached to its upper body, each of which had three additional joints stitched onto it. He just needed to align the joints of the new legs so they would reach the ground with the same ease as the old ones, and he could consider this one finished.\n\n"M-Master? Y-You have a g-guest that wishes to s-speak with you..."\n\nMagnus swiveled to see his personal minion, Servus. It was a sad thing, merely being a skull attached to two foal legs. Not very formidable, but it could ferry messages quite well. "Tell them that I need to focus, and that I will be with them in an hour." He returned to his work. These ghouls wouldn't stitch themselves together, after all.\n\n"M-Master, I m-must insist... it's M-Multa Corpora."\n\nMagnus set down his retractor. Despite creating countless ghouls with inspiration from that monstrosity of bones, he always hated dealing with it. Multa Corpora was a textbook example of what not to do with necromancy, something that every denizen of Magehold feared and respected. Composed of several bodies merged together in undying matrimony, it was extremely dangerous if angered. If it wanted to speak with him, then it would be unwise to deny it a conversation. At least it had the courtesy to ask politely, which was more than what Magnus could expect of Corpus."
dread_start.6.a:0 ""Very well, let it in.""

dread_start.7.t:0 "The Ancient Academic"
dread_start.7.d:0 "The bell tolled, signifying that the assembly was about to begin. Hundreds of aspiring and seasoned necromancers, living and unliving alike, gathered in the Great Hall of Animus, the premiere learning center for those interested in traditional necromancy. Hushed discussions could be heard throughout the hall, as many speculated about the purpose of the assembly. A gathering like this hadn't occurred since the death of Luvenis eleven years ago.\n\nThe mages began to quiet down when a modestly robed lich approached the stage. As the Rector of the Animus Institution, Timor Virtute enjoyed a significant amount of respect from the majority of creatures within the Dread League. His advances in the theorized creation of a fully autonomous undead have brought many necromancers leaps and bounds closer to realizing their full potential.\n\nA pregnant pause preceded Timor as he reached the podium. He gazed out across the vast crowd in front of him, then began to speak. "As you know, any mage can raise a corpse. There are many styles of necromancy, from the ghastly creations of the Stitchers to the malevolent power manifested within Potentia's bone hordes. But here, we practice necromancy for its original intention: To bring the dead back to life. This is our purpose here, and I hope that in your personal studies to further your abilities, you will continue to adhere to this principle."\n\nTimor stopped for a moment, then continued his speech, "Recently, Corpus Maledictus has announced that he will try to break the Third Great Seal. Inside of it lies a great power, but as for what it could be, we do not know. I encourage you all to prepare yourselves to incorporate whatever knowledge the Third Seal may contain into your own projects. Once I have more information on this matter, I will let you all know. Until then..."

dread_start.71.t:0 "Of Hopes and Dreams"
dread_start.71.d:0 "With a long sigh, Wilted Rose closed the dusty tome she had been reading. She had been studying the works of an ancient lich in an attempt to further her understanding of necromancy, but with every book she finished the teachings became less and less worthwhile. The old liches spoke of the many aspects that went into raising a corpse, but few delved into the theory of why. Those that did question the moral aspects of raising the dead never went past surface-level questions.\n\nThe young unicorn placed the tome back into the bookshelf. She'd been attending the Animus Institute for a few years now, but her studies had been stymied once she learned that the necromancers here had the same difficulty with raising lifelike corpses as she did.\n\nTruthfully, Wilted was starting to reconsider her life choices. Ever since she'd gotten her cutie mark, she had faced nothing but opposition from everypony that she had showed her talent to. Her family, friends, and classmates had all scorned her and told her to never practice necromancy, but deep down she knew that it wasn't inherently evil. She had wanted to prove to them that she could use it for good, to give ponies a chance to say goodbye to their loved ones, but she faced one major challenge that she just couldn't overcome: Her undead didn't retain their intelligence, at least not enough to act like they were alive.\n\nDespite her best efforts to learn from some of the greatest necromancers in the world, Wilted Rose was no closer to her goal than when she had started. Still, she didn't give up hope. She just had to keep trying, no matter how long it took."

dread_start.8.t:0 "The High Priestess"
dread_start.8.d:0 "Lux Tenebris leisurely walked through the corridors of her sect's domain. Behind her calm exterior was a cold, calculated fury. It was no secret that she despised Corpus and his slothful disposition, something that the current state of [POTENTIA RENAME]'s forces constantly reminded her of.\n\nShe scowled. Corpus Maledictus had been a blight on their reputation for years. Before he became the Dread King, he had previously been the High Priest for [POTENTIA RENAME], a title that now rightfully belonged to her. Lux had no idea how he had managed to secure that position. Corpus was an unbeliever, a heretic who had led several other liches astray from the faith.\n\nWith talk of the Third Seal's proposed breaking, a new opportunity has arisen, one that she couldn't stop thinking about. What glorious magic awaited them behind it? Whatever it was, many tasks would need to be done: Preparations for new knowledge to enter their practices and rituals, offerings to [THEIR GOD], and magical drills for their acolytes. Most importantly, Corpus would need to be dealt with.\n\nThe biggest issue she faced was one she loathed to admit: Corpus was formidable, perhaps even the most powerful mage within the Dread League. Knowing that he squandered that power twisted her bones so very much.\n\nLux paused by a dusty mirror to take a look at herself. Her flesh was completely gone, but her immaculate bones glistened in the candlelight, complimented by her ornate robes. She prided herself on her perfect bone structure; most other liches got a scratch or crack over the centuries. Not Lux Tenebris, though. She was better than them. Better than Corpus, even."
