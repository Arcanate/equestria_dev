DED_START_council:0 "Another Day at the Helm"
DED_START_council_desc:0 "For centuries the Dread Council has held meetings to discuss recent happenings or issues in or around the Dread Peninsula. Though the late Luvenis Maledicta had proven our ability to put a dent into the armour of those fanatical knights, Corpus has yet to take advantage of the plundered land. Despite being repeatedly pestered by the council to press our benefit, he remains complacent with our current position."

DED_START_magehold:0 "Within the Well of Knowledge"
DED_START_magehold_desc:0 "The Magisterium has been a centre of learning ever since The Library had been discovered. Many were surprised to hear the Dread Council's announcement and are eager to hear Vetus' opinion on the matter, should he be lucid enough to give one."

DED_START_Dominus:0 "Whispers Under the Pines' Shades"
DED_START_Dominus_desc:0 "Count Magister sits at the helm of House Dominus, one of the most influential clans of vampires within the Dread Peninsula. Known for prying into others' business, the sudden announcement came as a shock to him and his cabal. Perhaps an internal discussion on the matter is in order..."

DED_START_Concors:0 "The Court of the Twin Rulers"
DED_START_Concors_desc:0 "House Concors has remained the largest clan of vampires for almost a millenia, and despite constant internal strife it still retains its core philosophy: Limited "free will" for their thralls. The recent announcement has caused quite a stir within the clan. Many have already voiced their opinions, but they've yet to hear what The Twins have to say on the matter."

DED_START_Ruber:0 "The Crimson Mare's Progeny" 
DED_START_Ruber_desc:0 "Aside from the Progenitor, Lady Ruber is the oldest living vampire in the known world. She and her clan command the fiercest of thralls and, as they claim, the strongest bloodline. Those within House Ruber have always supported the Dread Council. Still, some wonder what Corpus' announcement might mean for their future."

DED_START_Aeternum:0 "The Stitchers' Dream"
DED_START_Aeternum_desc:0 "Those who subscribe to the School of Aeternum are often the most open to new ideas and change. With the recent announcement from Corpus, these eccentric necromancers have gone wild with speculation as to what new forms of magic might await them and their undead monstrosities."

DED_START_Animus:0 "The Beauty of Undeath"
DED_START_Animus_desc:0 "Raising a corpse isn't just a spell, it's an art form. Necromancers in the School of Animus pride themselves on their autonomous undead, often showcasing how most of their intelligence can be retained after death. Some are wondering if the recent announcement could lead into a deeper understanding of reanimation."

DED_START_Potentia:0 "The Purity of Desire"
DED_START_Potentia_desc:0 "It is no secret that the School of Potentia is reviled by most necromancers, yet these mad mages do not seem to care. What do others know of power? There is only one reason to practice necromancy and it is to extract undying obedience from one's foes. These necromancers are eager to discuss the implications of Corpus' announcement."

DED_START_Seal:0 "The Magnum Opus of Corpus Maledictus"
DED_START_Seal_desc:0 "As the clock strikes twelve, liches, vampires, and mages of all kinds begin to gather for what Corpus has heralded as the dawn of a new age for the Dread League. Whether he will actually be able to make good on his words is another story, however."

dread_start.0.t:0 "Another Day in the Dread Council"
dread_start.0.d:0 "The meeting began as any other, with pointless bickering and groaning. The seven members of the Dread Council sat around one another at an obsidian table depicting ancient runes used by the first necromancers. Among them were three vampires, two liches, and two still-living mages. There was an eighth seat larger than the others, but the dust layering its rugged cushion betrayed how often it was used.\n\nIt had been two years since Corpus stopped showing up to the annual Dread Convene, and three more since he stopped listening to their advice altogether. This had left the council to focus mainly on each other's faults and shortcomings since they could no longer count on Corpus to settle matters within the Dread League. There were a few things that they could agree on, however: their mutual dislike for Corpus Maledictus.\n\n"Why do we even bother with these meetings if Corpus isn't going to show up?" grumbled an old lich by the name of Lux Tenebris, "Wasn't the point of them to counsel the current Maledictus?"\n\nThe other council members murmured in agreement. They really hadn't accomplished that much lately, and their tenuous grasp over [THE PASSAGE] wasn't being properly utilized. There were still pockets of unclaimed peasants left, even after ten years of controlling their land! Corpus had neglected to divide the spoils amongst the Dread Council, and thus they never did settle on an agreement for what to do with the area.\n\nSoon arguments turned back towards differing opinions on how to handle the "Arcturian Menace" that had been bothering them for a millenium. Many were in agreement that something needed to be done, but none could agree on a proper strategy to combat those wretched knights.\n\nAs the hours went on with countless quarrels going unresolved, two representatives from the vampire clans rose from their seats, not wanting to waste their time any further. As they announced their declaration to leave, a loud creak could be heard across the room. All heads turned to see an elegantly robed lich step through the door."
dread_start.0.a:0 ""I apologize for being late."

dread_start.1.t:0 "The Dread King's Announcement"
dread_start.1.d:0 ""LATE?! You believe yourself to be merely late?!" screeched Lady Ruber, the eldest of the vampire lords. Beside her were Count Magister of House Dominus, and Baron Greten who was standing in for The Twins of House Concors. They seemed equally furious; the former was coldly staring down Corpus while the latter clenched his claws to restrain himself.\n\n"You have done a great disservice to the Dread Council, Corpus," condemned Magnus Medicus, the famous, yet mortal stitcher of the School of Aeternum, "If Luvenis was still here, you would be reduced to dust for your failure to manage the League."\n\n"It pains me to know that you once studied in the School of Animus. You are nothing but a disgrace to our field of necromancy." said Timor Virtute, who, if one didn't know any better, looked perfectly alive and not at all like a typical lich.\n\nLux Tenebris of the School of Potentia remained silent, but her hatred could be felt emanating off of her bones.\n\nTutor Libra, a living mage representing the Magisterium, merely shook her head. "Congratulations, Corpus. You've succeeded in getting the Dread Council to finally agree on something: That you are the main problem here."\n\nCorpus paid no mind to their rants, however. He leisurely walked over to his chair, magically dusted it off, then sat upon it. "I have an important announcement for you all today."\n\nBaron Greten scoffed, "An announcement? What of the ongoing issues that we've been trying-"\n\n"I assure you my good Baron," interrupted Corpus, "that what I am going to do will fix most, if not all of those issues." Corpus' horn ignited, the swirl of his sickly green aura permeating throughout the central table. After a moment, it seemed to construct a glowing replica of the Library of Magehold. "As you all know, the Library is the source of our knowledge and power. For aeons it has held countless tomes and scrolls depicting ancient spells, but most of them were hidden behind the Great Seals. Over a thousand years ago, our esteemed Librarian Vetus Maledictus broke two of these Great Seals, granting us the powers of Advanced Necromancy and Vampirism."\n\nLady Ruber rolled her eyes in annoyance, "Some of us were there, remember? Get to the point."\n\nCorpus raised his hooves in a grand motion, "My friends, I am going to usher in a new world of magic by breaking open the Third Great Seal."
dread_start.1.a:0 "He's going to do what?"

dread_start.2.t:0 "The Magisterium"
dread_start.2.d:0 "Ornate candles illuminated the chambers of the Library of Magehold. Many scholars and mages could be seen roaming the halls, studying and organizing the carefully preserved tomes that numbered in the tens of thousands.\n\nOne scholar in particular was trotting through the halls in a hurry, however. Wearing the signature robe that indicated membership of the Dread Council, Tutor Libra was seeking out the oldest creature in the Dread League: Vetus Maledictus. She needed to consult the ancient lich regarding the proclamation of Corpus.\n\nTutor passed by a pair of mages examining one of the many magical seals blocking off sections of the Library. Though a significant number of minor seals had been broken by Vetus, some even by other mages, countless more still hide vast sections of the Library. The place was already a maze to begin with; each month, the maps needed to be updated with newly accessible areas.\n\nShe had a hunch of where to find Vetus, though. Tutor made her way to the grand spiral staircase that separated the major sections of the Library. As she descended, she saw a magnificent white glow from below. When she reached the bottom, she saw a lone, hooded figure standing in front of the glimmering magical barrier. The Third Great Seal. Beyond it was... who knows? Something comparable to the power of liches and vampires, that's for sure.\n\nTutor cleared her throat, stepping forward, "Vetus, I bring news. Corpus intends to breach the next Great Seal, and, well... I would like to know your thoughts on that."\n\nIf the hooded figure heard her, it didn't seem to acknowledge it. Tutor was about to clear her throat again when she heard Vetus' old, decrepit voice murmur something. She couldn't quite make out his words, so she stepped closer. "Vetus? Did you hear me?"\n\nThe figure turned towards her, revealing a withered husk of a stallion. Dried flesh and piercing yellow eyes bored into her, sending shivers up her spine. Vetus Maledictus then returned his gaze to the barrier, murmuring, "Time is approaching its end, and only one will be able to see it. The mare and the wind will battle, and death itself will die. Then the future will be certain.""

dread_start.6.t:0 "School of Aeternum"
dread_start.6.d:0 "As Magnus Medicus returned to his personal workshop, he took a moment to ponder the implications of what Corpus had said. If the Third Great Seal was truly about to be opened, then it would be prudent to let the other stitchers of Aeternum know to be ready for a wealth of incoming knowledge. Who knows? There might be new methods for reanimation that they could apply to their various creations. In any case, Magnus needed to prepare his thoughts to present to the other stitchers, and he knew just how to focus his mind.\n\nMagnus sat down on a stool next to a bloodied table. Donning an equally bloodied lab coat borrowed from his brief tenure at the University of Gamia, he set to work on his latest project: an intact pony corpse with an extra four legs surgically attached to its upper body, each of which had three additional joints stitched onto it. He just needed to align the joints of the new legs so they would reach the ground with the same ease as the old ones, and he could consider this one finished.\n\n"M-Master? Y-You have a g-guest that wishes to s-speak with you..."\n\nMagnus swiveled to see his personal minion, Servus. It was a sad thing, merely being a skull attached to two foal legs. Not very formidable, but it could ferry messages quite well. "Tell them that I need to focus, and that I will be with them in an hour." He returned to his work. These ghouls wouldn't stitch themselves together, after all.\n\n"M-Master, I m-must insist... it's M-Multa Corpora."\n\nMagnus set down his retractor. Despite creating countless ghouls with inspiration from that monstrosity of bones, he always hated dealing with it. Multa Corpora was a textbook example of what not to do with necromancy, something that every denizen of Magehold feared and respected. Composed of several bodies merged together in undying matrimony, it was extremely dangerous if angered. If it wanted to speak with him, then it would be unwise to deny it a conversation. At least it had the courtesy to ask politely, which was more than what Magnus could expect of Corpus."
dread_start.6.a:0 ""Very well, let it in.""

dread_start.7.t:0 "School of Animus"
dread_start.7.d:0 "Within the dim chambers of an Animus classroom, a small group of mages sat in a semi-circle. In front of them was a deceased pony brought in from some faraway land. One of the mages mumbled something, then a magical glow briefly encompassed both her horn and the corpse.\n\nSuddenly, the corpse bolted upright, looking around in shock. "What happened? Who are you all?! Where am I?!?"\n\n"Must you always give them so much freedom, Wilted?" One of the mages scoffed at his classmate, "You're talented, yes. But ghouls need some constraint, even here."\n\nThe newly raised undead began to panic. "What are you talking about?! Where have you taken me?! I wanna go home!"\n\nWith a sigh, the female mage released her ghoul. It fell to the ground as lifeless as it was a minute ago. She stared at it with a longing, "I thought we were here to learn about giving the undead autonomy, not restricting their ability to think."\n\nThe other mage shook his head. "It's dangerous to give too much-"\n\nThe door to the chamber opened with a resounding boom, "Dangerous to give what, my student?" The other mages turned to see their headmaster, Timor Virtute. Though he was several hundred years their senior, he looked no older than fifty. He maintained his flesh rather well for a lich of his age.\n\nThe younger mage shifted uncomfortably, "Well, it's dangerous to give our undead too much freedom, we need to keep a leash on them, otherwise they could do things behind our backs."\n\n"Nonsense," Timor shook his head, "If you do not give your undead the autonomy they need to grow, then you will not grow as a necromancer either." The lich looked at each one of the students, resting his gaze on Wilted."
dread_start.7.a:0 ""Heed this lesson and you could become far greater than I one day.""

dread_start.8.t:0 "School of Potentia"
dread_start.8.d:0 "Lux Tenebris leisurely walked through the corridors of her sect's domain. Though she had earlier been furious with Corpus for his incompetence, now she couldn't stop thinking of what glorious magic awaited her behind the Third Seal. And it would be hers to master, of course. Once she informed the rest of her kin of this new development, they'd certainly want to be ready to seize whatever power awaited them.\n\nShe could finally show the other necromancers that her ideology was the correct way to handle the undead. It wasn't about art, it wasn't about wisdom, it was about power, pure and simple. To exert absolute control over your enemies' corpses and to use them against their former friends. That is what it means to be a necromancer.\n\nLux passed by a grand mirror and paused to take a look at herself. Her flesh was nearly completely gone, but her immaculate bones glistened with the candlelight. She prided herself on her perfect bone structure, most other liches got a scratch or crack over the centuries. Not Lux, though. She was better than them. Better than Corpus, even. Perhaps if she could find his phylactery...\n\nShe put aside such thoughts. She had to give her associates the good news, after all. She magically opened the chamber door in front of her, then began to address the necromancers of the School of Potentia."
