DED_START_council:0 "Another Day at the Helm"
DED_START_council_desc:0 "For centuries the Dread Council has held meetings to discuss recent happenings or issues in or around the Dread Peninsula. Though the late Luvenis Maledicta had proven our ability to put a dent into the armour of those fanatical knights, Corpus has yet to take advantage of the plundered land. Despite being repeatedly pestered by the council to press our benefit, he remains complacent with our current position."

DED_START_magehold:0 "Within the Well of Knowledge"
DED_START_magehold_desc:0 "The Magisterium has been a centre of learning ever since The Library had been discovered. Many were surprised to hear the Dread Council's announcement and are eager to hear Vetus' opinion on the matter, should he be lucid enough to give one."

DED_START_Dominus:0 "Whispers Under the Pines' Shades"
DED_START_Dominus_desc:0 "Count Magister sits at the helm of House Dominus, one of the most influential clans of vampires within the Dread Peninsula. Known for prying into others' business, the sudden announcement came as a shock to him and his cabal. Perhaps an internal discussion on the matter is in order..."

DED_START_Concors:0 "The Court of the Twin Rulers"
DED_START_Concors_desc:0 "House Concors has remained the largest clan of vampires for almost a millenia, and despite constant internal strife it still retains its core philosophy: Limited "free will" for their thralls. The recent announcement has caused quite a stir within the clan. Many have already voiced their opinions, but they've yet to hear what The Twins have to say on the matter."

DED_START_Ruber:0 "The Crimson Mare's Progeny" 
DED_START_Ruber_desc:0 "Aside from the Progenitor, Lady Ruber is the oldest living vampire in the known world. She and her clan command the fiercest of thralls and, as they claim, the strongest bloodline. Those within House Ruber have always supported the Dread Council. Still, some wonder what Corpus' announcement might mean for their future."

DED_START_Aeternum:0 "The Stitchers' Dream"
DED_START_Aeternum_desc:0 "Those who subscribe to the School of Aeternum are often the most open to new ideas and change. With the recent announcement from Corpus, these eccentric necromancers have gone wild with speculation as to what new forms of magic might await them and their undead monstrosities."

DED_START_Animus:0 "The Beauty of Undeath"
DED_START_Animus_desc:0 "Raising a corpse isn't just a spell, it's an art form. Necromancers in the School of Animus pride themselves on their autonomous undead, often showcasing how most of their intelligence can be retained after death. Some are wondering if the recent announcement could lead into a deeper understanding of reanimation."

DED_START_Potentia:0 "The Purity of Desire"
DED_START_Potentia_desc:0 "It is no secret that the School of Potentia is reviled by most necromancers, yet these mad mages do not seem to care. What do others know of power? There is only one reason to practice necromancy and it is to extract undying obedience from one's foes. These necromancers are eager to discuss the implications of Corpus' announcement."

DED_START_Seal:0 "The Magnum Opus of Corpus Maledictus"
DED_START_Seal_desc:0 "As the clock strikes twelve, liches, vampires, and mages of all kinds begin to gather for what Corpus has heralded as the dawn of a new age for the Dread League. Whether he will actually be able to make good on his words is another story, however."
