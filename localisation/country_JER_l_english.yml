 ### Events ###
 aquileia.1.t:0 "Divide and Conquer I: Michel and Dennis"
 aquileia.1.d:0 "It has recently come to our attentions that there are massive amounts of rebels and other miscreants hiding within the Barony of Pridea and the Duchy of Rila, and while we could support both of our vassals and help them deal with their respective situations before they escalate the King has decided to only help one in order to draw all the traitors to one spot."
 aquileia.1.a:0 "We'll help Michel with his issues"
 aquileia.1.b:0 "I always liked Denis more"
 aquileia.2.t:0 "Centralisation"
 aquileia.2.d:0 "With the situation in Pridea growing more dire by the day, and with King Moriset pushing more and more funding into Rila we have been left in a truly odd spot. While the increased funding and military assistance from the rest of Aquileia has been instrumental in dealing with our own unrest it has left us woefully dependant on Aquileia proper, and left the title of Duke of Rila honorary for all intents and purposes. Perhaps we should just hand over the governorship of the Duchy back to the King?"
 aquileia.2.a:0 "Well... it was a good run"
 aquileia.2.b:0 "The Duke still does very important things!"
 aquileia.3.t:0 "The Return of the President"
 aquileia.3.d:0 "Chaos consumed the streets of Pridea today, as thousands of angry protesters and rebels stormed the Baron's Palace, and after striking Baron Denis dead proclaimed a Pridean Republic. The rebels even had the audacity to proclaim the long exiled Théodore Vérany as president of Pridea, but for his part he has decided to remain in exile in New Manehatten."
 aquileia.3.a:0 "Viva la revolucion!"
 aquileia.4.t:0 "Centralisation"
 aquileia.4.d:0 "With the situation in Rila growing more dire by the day, and with King Moriset pushing more and more funding towards Pridea we have been left in a truly odd spot. While the increased funding and military assistance from the rest of Aquileia has been instrumental in dealing with our own unrest it has left us woefully dependant on Aquileia proper, and left the title of Baron of Pridea honorary for all intents and purposes. Perhaps we should just hand over the governorship of the Barony back to the King?"
 aquileia.4.a:0 "I'm sure Moriset will do well"
 aquileia.4.b:0 "The Baron still does important things!"
 aquileia.5.t:0 "The Rise of Communism"
 aquileia.5.d:0 "Chaos consumed the Duchy of Rila today as thousands of impoverished citizens took to the streets to protest. The protests quickly turned violent after a Ducal Guard shot one of the protesters, this action led to the eventual storming of the Ducal Palace, the death of the Duke and the proclimation of a Communist State under the leadership of Colonel Augustin Giraud... Needless to say it was an interesting turn of events."
 aquileia.5.a:0 "Workers of Rila unite!"
