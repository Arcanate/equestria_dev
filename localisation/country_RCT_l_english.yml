 rivercity.13.t:0 "The Poverty Issue"
 rivercity.13.d:0 "One of the bitterest and most acrimonious disputes between the Harmonist and Socialist parties is the issue of poverty. Thousands of mares and stallions live on barest subsistence, and it is extremely hard for any of the poor to find gainful employment. This stagnation has continued for several years now, and both sides blame each other for failing to act appropriately. The Harmonists, being the majority party, have proposed a bill that would increase investment in industry and infrastructure, arguing that this growth would create new jobs for the poor to take up and lift themselves out of poverty, while the Socialists are unconvinced, preferring the implementation of extensive social welfare programmes. Nova Whirl, leader of the Socialist opposition party, has condemnded the Harmonist plan, calling it the "Fat Cat Benefit Act", and has threatened to expel any Socialist that supports it from her party. While the government does not need the support of many Socialists, if more than 90% of her party follows her line on this issue, then we may fail to secure a big enough majority to pass the bill."

 rivercity.16.t:0 "The Rural/Urban Divide"
 rivercity.16.d:0 "The second issue to cause dissent among the Coalition is the issue of rural versus urban concerns. The Harmonist party draws much of its support from the rural farming population, while the Socialists rely almost entirely on urbanites and factory workers for their votes. However, in recent years the farmers have begun to feel that even the Harmonists are not really their friends, as they have spent more and more time dealing with budgetary and economic concerns, and less time addressing the issues that matter to them. They complain of a lack of good infrastructure, making it hard to sell their crops, of the high cost of fertiliser, making farming less profitable than it could be, and especially of the lack of policing in remote rural areas. River Swirl absolutely cannot afford to lose the farmers' support, and so she has drafted a Rural Development Plan with a view to consolidating their loyalty to Harmony. The Socialists, understandably, are less enthusiastic about this plan. While they cannot scupper the Bill entirely, they are advising that it be amended substantially to spread its funding between urban and rural areas - a move that would benefit them, and only them. The only question that remains is whether or not they will be able to secure enough support from the less-loyal Harmonists to get what they want..."

 rivercity.19.t:0 "The Talzar Commune"
 rivercity.19.d:0 "The third issue that has come before the Cabinet is an odd one. A group of urbanite, upper-middle class city ponies has left their dwellings in Rijekograd and taken up a primitive, agrarian mode of existence in the Talzar Hills. They have begun to forget that they are, in fact, part of our country, and ignore the central government's orders. They refuse to pay their taxes, refuse to respect police officers, and in general act as if they were a completely independent country. Things have come to a head, as a tax collector was attacked by the Talzarites when she tried to force them to comply with the law. This has led to fresh tensions in government. On the one hoof, this is a flagrant attack on a government official, and cannot be tolerated. On the other, the official was a tax collector, and most of the public is having a hard time mustering much sympathy for a tax collector. Still, there is a general consensus that *something* ought to be done about these play-pretend farmers. After much wrangling, it has been agreed that one more diplomatic envoy should be sent to tell them to buzz off, but both political parties have suggested their own candiates for the task. The Harmonists favor the hard-nosed marshal Hector Lizzip, while Nova Whirl herself has offered to go as the Socialist representative."

 rivercity.22.d:0 "It is no secret that River Swirl and Nova Whirl hate each other, and constantly attempt to undermine each other's positions, but it was only today that their mutual disdain came fully to a head. At the climax of a particularly heated debate, Nova Whirl publicly proclaimed a motion of No Confidence in the Chancellor, and as if planned in advance, her entire party followed behind her. This puts River Swirl in an untenable position - she can no longer run a democratic government without at least the nominal confidence of the second largest party. If her own party was united, they might have been able to press on and simply ignore the Socialists, but the RHS is a loose coalition of conservatives, liberals, and mild socialists united only by their fear and mistrust of the SKR. Many of her own party members abstained from voting or even (shockingly) voted No Confidence also, leaving the Chancellor with few options. She will have to go back to the polls."
 rivercity.22.a:0 "Dissolve the Government and hold a snap election!"

 rivercity.23.t:0 "Debate In Coltovac"
 rivercity.23.d:0 "As part of the campaign trail, both candidates have engaged in an extensive debate in Coltovac. As both are well-known for hating each other and have intimate knowledge of each other's political foibles, this debate drew a huge crowd, expecting to see mud-slinging on an unprecedented scale - and they were not disappointed. Though the umpire tried to keep the debate on point, it quickly devolved into a shouting match about who was responsible for the government's inability to get anything done. Police eventually had to disperse the crowd and end the "debate" prematurely in order to prevent a riot from breaking out. Nonetheless, the crowd on that day was more impressed..."
 rivercity.23.a:0 "By River Swirl"
 rivercity.23.b:0 "By Nova Whirl"
 rivercity.24.t:0 "Day of The Deputy"
 rivercity.24.d:0 "As the short snap election nears its close, both parties realised the need to keep River Swirl and Nova Whirl away from each other, for fear that the closing debate of the campaign woud result in a riot in the capital. As such, this debate was chaired by a representative chosen by the party leadership, rather than by the party heads themselves. On one side, the Harmonists were represented by Marshal Hector Lizzip, while the Socialist Party elected Nova's second-in-command, Caramel Haze, to speak for them. This debate, though more orderly than the previous, was still filled with fiery oration, as Caramel Haze is a far more stringent Stallionist than Nova Whirl, while Hector is a stern anti-Communist. Thankfully, the animated rhetoric did not result in animated rioters, and at the end of the day, the crowd was most convinced by..."
 rivercity.24.a:0 "Hector's patriotism"

 rivercity.26.t:0 "The Emergency Powers Bill"
 rivercity.26.d:0 "The RHS is a broad tent of political viewpoints, united only by their fear and hatred of Communism. As such, they rarely agree on anything, and River Swirl cannot even trust the majority of them to support her on hard issues most of the time. However, today, in a rare display of unity, the party has unanimously passed a resolution to provide the Chancellor with wide-ranging powers in the event of an "Emergency". Ostensibly meant to preserve the Republic's ability to fight wars and suppress rebellion without being crippled by obstructionist politicians, many note that the Bill leaves the definition of "Emergency" up entirely to the discretion of the Chancellor, and thus is a dangerous first step on the path to autocracy. Despite these concerns, the RHS has been so disgusted by recent Socialist attempt to paralyse our democracy that it has consented to allow this bill to be drawn up. The Bill was voted through by a rare united front of Harmonists, and now all that River Swirl needs to do is sign the Bill into law..."
 rivercity.26.a:0 "I must think this over for a while"
 rivercity.27.t:0 "Red Saturday"
 rivercity.27.d:0 "Though they were allies for as long the the Harmonists were in power, Nova Swirl has never seen eye to eye with her second-in-command, Caramel Haze. He was always too radical, too willing and ready to fight, too dismissive of stategy or common sense. He was in some sense a religious fanatic, assured that all that was needed for the Revolution to succeed was for Communists to fight for it with sufficient zeal. In fact, when Nova once asked him in exasperation whether he would prefer fighting the entire River Coalition alone to subverting the bourgeois democracy from within first, he immediately replied with a "Yes".\n It was for these reasons, among others, that the two have never gotten along that well. Today, that division has flared up in a dramatic way. Caramel Haze, as a high-ranking army general, has authority over many divisions, and it has come to the attention of Nova's spies that the divisions assigned to protect Rijekograd have slowly been rotated out over the last few weeks in favor of units nominally under Haze's control. This is a deeply worrying sign, for the two socialist leaders have recently argued in the Central Committee, and it seems that Caramel's patience has finally run out. All the evidence points to the early stages of a coup. Will Nova Swirl's spies report back in time?"
 rivercity.27.a:0 "Caramel's loyal soldiers seize control of the apparatus of state!"
 rivercity.27.b:0 "The spies' report makes it through, and the Red Army arrests Caramel"

 rivercity.8.t:0 "New Minister of the Treasury"
 rivercity.8.d:0 "With the Republic stable and the financial sector once again about to function, the vacancy in the office of the Minister of Treasury has grown too important to ignore. We must choose a new administrator to hold the position, however there are no notable candidates in the lower levels of the administration. Your Baba back in Zagrep has suggested you give the job to your Cousin, Pumpkin Swirl. This would be sure to be appreciated by your family, and it's not like there's many impressive candidates, but it may cause a stir if you begin promoting family to office."

Of course, nopony expected the Bill to magically fix everything in a few weeks, but everyone expected at least some promising signs. Sadly, these signs have been lacking. Business leaders are not convinced that it will be enough, or are wary of being mired in the complicated tangle of laws that would be the result of accepting state funding.

As such, the Harmonist party are taking the blame for the government's inaction and seeming impotence in the face of the poverty crisis. Opinion polls show support for the government being corroded, as the people slowly begin to believe that they might just be useless after all."
 CommBlamedDesc:0 "In an explosive press conference, River Swirl has denounced the Socialists for their meddling and intransigence, blaming them for thwarting the government's attempts to save the economy. Though some consider this an excuse, many ponies are leery enough of the Socialists that they believed this, and now it seems that the Harmonists have successfully deflected the blame for the government's inaction onto the Socialist Party! The result has been a sharp, swift decline in popularity for Nova's party, threatening it with a gradual slide into irrelevance."

Some worried that there would not be enough money to ensure that anything significant got done in either area, but this turned out not to be a problem, thanks to excellent, scientific management principles. This has significantly eroded support for the Harmonists, and expanded our base among the farmers."
 MixedInvestmentFailedDesc:0 "Disaster! Our attempts to split funding efforts between rural and urban centres has divided our money in too many directions, and no single project has been a success - that is to say, the entire enterprise has been a failure. This debacle and waste of money has made us look like fools in both the cities and the countryside!"
 RuralInvestmentSuccessDesc:0 "Our investment efforts into the rural heartlands of our country have met with initial success! New roads allow farmers to transport goods to market much faster and more easily, an investment in fertilisers has raised crop yields overall, and increased police spending has led to a sharp drop in rural crime (an issue that particularly bothers those who have to live in remote areas). Overall, quality of life for the farmers seems set to improve - and they are extremely grateful to us for it."
 RuralInvestmentFailureDesc:0 "Sadly, our attempts to invest in rural infrastructure have met with failure.

 WildheartSuccessTitle:0 "Tough Love"
 WildheartFailureTitle:0 "The Talzar Terror"
 NovaSwirlConvincesDesc:0 "In a moving display, Nova Swirl has announced today the formal establishment of the Talzar Commune as an autonomous region of the River Republic. The Talzarites have, apparently, agreed to pay taxes and follow the laws of our country providing that we allow them to govern themselves. This decision, which Nova Swirl by no means had the right to make, has been seen as a direct attack on the legitimacy of River Swirl's government. Despite the outrageous overstepping of her own authority, the public as a whole seems to just be happy that the issue is dealt with, and nopony seems to be willing to go to the bother of overturning a solution that seems to be working. It seems as if the illegal decision must be allowed to stand."
 NovaSwirlUnconvincingDesc:0 "To Nova Whirl's dismay, the Talzarites were unwilling to listen to her proposal of autonomy within the Republic. They simply considered themselves 'citizens of the world', and not bound by the laws of a society they hadn't chosen to be born into. Nova Whirl's repeated attempts to convince them met with no more success, and while what happened next is not precisely clear, what is known is that Nova Whirl returned to Rijekograd in a wet, mud-soaked burlap sack. In light of her abject failure, Wildheart has taken matters into his own hooves and forcibly dispersed the Talzarites back to their own homes. The whole affair has been an embarassment to the Socialist cause, and has made the Harmonist government look altogether stronger or more competent than ever before."
 WildheartSuccessDesc:0 "Marshal Hector always had a reputation as a tough, no-nonsense commander who wouldn't take guff from anypony, even from the richest and most powerful families in the Republic. As such, when he and a hundred soldiers marched up the hills to the Talzarites and ordered them to cease squatting on land that they had no right to, they had to take notice. The professionalism of the soldiers was without peer, as not a single shot was fired, and not a single Talzarite was injured as they were frog-marched back to their houses. While some regard his methods as a little excessive, most ponies are just happy that Hector was able to slap some sense into these fools."
 WildheartFailureDesc:0 "Marshal Hector has always had a reputation as a tough-minded military commander - but perhaps his military methods aren't quite what was needed for an expedition such as this. The thick-headed, idealistic leader of the Talzar Commune immediately butted heads with Hector, and as neither was willing to back down, violence ensued. Accurate reports on what precisely transpired are impossible to come by, but what we do know is that the Talzarites fled the hills in terror, spreading stories of cruel violence. While nopony really liked the Talzarites, very few wanted to see them dead, and this display of excessive force has caused support for River Swirl to take a sharp hit. The Socialists, in particular, have turned Talzar almost into a rallying-cry, and are daily denouncing our government as illegitimate."
