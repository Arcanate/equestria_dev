 #### EVENTS  ####
 rivercity.13.t:0 "The Poverty Issue"
 rivercity.13.d:0 "One of the bitterest and most acrimonious disputes between the Harmonist and Socialist parties is the issue of poverty. Thousands of mares and stallions live on barest subsistence, and it is extremely hard for any of the poor to find gainful employment. This stagnation has continued for several years now, and both sides blame each other for failing to act appropriately. The Harmonists, being the majority party, have proposed a bill that would increase investment in industry and infrastructure, arguing that this growth would create new jobs for the poor to take up and lift themselves out of poverty, while the Socialists are unconvinced, preferring the implementation of extensive social welfare programmes. Nova Whirl, leader of the Socialist opposition party, has condemnded the Harmonist plan, calling it the "Fat Cat Benefit Act", and has threatened to expel any Socialist that supports it from her party. While the government does not need the support of many Socialists, if more than 90% of her party follows her line on this issue, then we may fail to secure a big enough majority to pass the bill."

 rivercity.16.t:0 "The Rural/Urban Divide"
 rivercity.16.d:0 "The second issue to cause dissent among the Coalition is the issue of rural versus urban concerns. The Harmonist party draws much of its support from the rural farming population, while the Socialists rely almost entirely on urbanites and factory workers for their votes. However, in recent years the farmers have begun to feel that even the Harmonists are not really their friends, as they have spent more and more time dealing with budgetary and economic concerns, and less time addressing the issues that matter to them. They complain of a lack of good infrastructure, making it hard to sell their crops, of the high cost of fertiliser, making farming less profitable than it could be, and especially of the lack of policing in remote rural areas. River Swirl absolutely cannot afford to lose the farmers' support, and so she has drafted a Rural Development Plan with a view to consolidating their loyalty to Harmony. The Socialists, understandably, are less enthusiastic about this plan. While they cannot scupper the Bill entirely, they are advising that it be amended substantially to spread its funding between urban and rural areas - a move that would benefit them, and only them. The only question that remains is whether or not they will be able to secure enough support from the less-loyal Harmonists to get what they want..."

 BillSuccessTitle:0 "Industry, The Engine of Wealth"
 BillSuccessDesc:0 "Good news! Initial signs from the passing of the Industrial Incentive Bill are positive, as business owners and industrialists across the land are filled with confidence. Factories have begun to churn once more, and orders for raw materials have been sent out in record numbers in anticipation of brisker business. Already, new positions and openings have appeared in the labor market, and while these are few, the public have taken them as a sign that the Bill is working."
 BillSuccessButton:0 "Always trust the free market"
 BillFailTitle:0 "A Stimulus Failure"
 BillFailDesc:0 "Unfortunately, despite the passing of the Industrial Incentive Bill, very little has improved in the state of our economy. Of course, nopony expected the Bill to magically fix everything in a few weeks, but everyone expected at least some promising signs. Sadly, these signs have been lacking. Business leaders are not convinced that it will be enough, or are wary of being mired in the complicated tangle of laws that would be the result of accepting state funding. The common wisdom on the street is that the Bill is just another futile effort by a failing government."
 BillFailButton:0 "Dammit! Now the Socialists will be vindicated!"
 HarmonyBlamedTitle:0 "Public Blames The Government"
 CommBlamedTitle:0 "Public Lashes Out At The Socialists"
 HarmonyBlamedDesc:0 "Despite the fact that Nova Swirl's Socialists were responsible for the government's plan being killed, the public is not privy to everything that happens in the halls of power. As such, the Harmonist party are taking the blame for the government's inaction and seeming impotence in the face of the poverty crisis. Opinion polls show support for the government being corroded, as the people slowly begin to believe that they might just be useless after all."
 CommBlamedDesc:0 "In an explosive press conference, River Swirl has denounced the Socialists for their meddling and intransigence, blaming them for thwarting the government's attempts to save the economy. Though some consider this an excuse, many ponies are leery enough of the Socialists that they believed this, and now it seems that the Harmonists have successfully deflected the blame for the government's inaction onto the Socialist Party! The result has been a sharp, swift decline in popularity for Nova's party, threatening it with a gradual slide into irrelevance."
 HarmonyBlamedButton:0 "Those bourgeois fools had it coming"

 MixedInvestmentSuccessTitle:0 "Bridging The Divide"
 MixedInvestmentFailedTitle:0 "Like Butter Over Too Much Bread"
 RuralInvestmentSuccessTitle:0 "The Faithful Farmers"
 RuralInvestmentFailureTitle:0 "Throwing Money To The Pigs"
 MixedInvestmentSuccessDesc:0 "As we predicted, the project of investing both in rural and urban areas has provided the most benefit for all. Some worried that there would not be enough money to ensure that anything significant got done in either area, but this turned out not to be a problem, thanks to excellent, scientific management principles. This has significantly eroded support for the Harmonists, and expanded our base among the farmers."
 MixedInvestmentFailedDesc:0 "Disaster! Our attempts to split funding efforts between rural and urban centres has divided our money in too many directions, and no single project has been a success - that is to say, the entire enterprise has been a failure. This debacle and waste of money has made us look like fools in both the cities and the countryside!"
 RuralInvestmentSuccessDesc:0 "Our investment efforts into the rural heartlands of our country have met with initial success! New roads allow farmers to transport goods to market much faster and more easily, an investment in fertilisers has raised crop yields overall, and increased police spending has led to a sharp drop in rural crime (an issue that particularly bothers those who have to live in remote areas). Overall, quality of life for the farmers seems set to improve - and they are extremely grateful to us for it."
 RuralInvestmentFailureDesc:0 "Sadly, our attempts to invest in rural infrastructure have met with failure. A mixture of bureacratic obstinance and lack of enthusiastic support by farmers has resulted in our efforts coming to nothing. Despite the large sums spent on this project, we have very little to show for it."
 MixedInvestmentSuccessButton:0 "Yet more proof of the superiority of scientific socialism"
 MixedInvestmentFailedButton:0 "It simply was not carried out properly!"
 RuralInvestmentSuccessButton:0 "The farmers have always been reliable"
 RuralInvestmentFailureButton:0 "Blast it! Nova Whirl will be laughing at us!"
