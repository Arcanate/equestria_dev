state_lore_text_container_state_description_30:0 "There is a charm in the city of Ayacachtli that begets wonderous thoughts in anypony; here is a city, that was ancient before Equestria had even been formed. Located in the southern jungles, in the mountains on the border of Badlands, Ayacachtli has the dubious honour of being the oldest thestral city in the world. Legends hold it, that it was constructed by a thestral Moonspeaker with the aid of an Ursa Major. Historians, however, place its origins to many millenia ago, to the times when thestral tribes and the Neighua came into conflict and a need for a safe haven was born. Whatever it may have been, thestrals have been living in the city for so long, that only bare estimates can be given with current historical records.\n\nQuite an unusual aspect about Ayacachtli is the fact it is located inside the mountain range, inside a cast cavern dug over time by its denizens. Even as times have advanced, majority of the city is still located safely there, with just part of the more modern city located outside. Where, along with them, plenty of terraces for farming are located to feed the mountain city. But it is not food that Ayacachtli is known for; for the mountains contain many riches such as copper, silver and gold. Historians have traced many ancient trade routes leading to Ayacachtli from the north, carrying goods such as iron weapons and armour in exchange for the mined minerals. Evidence shows that Ayacachtli served as a vital link for trade between the jungles and north, through which luxury goods such as sugar and cocoa from jungle tribes passed by. Once the princesses proceeded with their formation of Equestria, Ayacachtli found itself in a favourable position - at least until the incident with Nightmare Moon occured. Now shunned, the thesrals returned to living amongs themselves, in fear of respitals and revenge for siding with the horrid monster that had once been their beloved princess. This especially hurt Ayacachtli and the city endured for centuries as but a hollow shell of a once mighty realm.\n\nToday, Ayacachtli stands as a testament for vigority of thestralkind as a near total majority of its denizens are made up of thestrals. Even the ponies there are usually tribals from the jungles, who have interacted with the thestrals far longer than any northener has and even tend to share a common tongue with. Modernization is present in the city but mixed in to tradition and the peculiar aspects of thestrals; Ayacachtli has no real streets, as near-every denizen can fly. This has led to the city developing not horitzontally as a traditional city but primarily vertically. Tall towers, reaching from the cavern's ceiling to the floor, dot the vast cave, with the odd bridge crossing the gaps between them. Even with modern electricity, most of Ayacachtli is cast in but dim light, to better suit the sensitive eyes of thestrals. Further caverns extend out from the main one, which lead to the many mining tunnels; Ayacachtli even to this day is mostly dependant upon its ore exports to many Equestrian industries north; one could perhaps find some irony in how some things never change.\n\nCentral part of the city and an aspect that cannot be missed is the Temple of Moon, located at the city's center and remains a staunchly visited complex by the thestrals. It is the place where every Moonspeaker comes to learn the traditional ways and read the ancient texts stored within there. Some said to more than millenia old but no outsiders are permitted to see them, not even a certain Princess of Books. But what a visitor can see is already extraordinary, and a sight to rival even that of Canterlot. For right past its entrance, visitors are met with a giant dome covering the main hall. On this dome there is a vividly well-detailed star map, one born from countless generations of work from the Moonspeakers. Every possible inch of the carved stone accurately details the wonders of the night sky to the point that astronomers from Princess Luna's Academy of Stars have praised the meticulous work the priests have done, even rivalling achievements historical astronomers such as Galloping Galley and Leap Ordinance. There have been calls to preserve the temple complex for sake of history but for thestrals, however, the temple still serves its original purpose, as it did since its inception; to venerate the Moon, as their forebears did before them. A work that continues on, and will do so for more millenia to come."

The outskirts are filled with civilian refugees, discharged sailors, and soldiers far from home.\n\nIn spite of all this, the city's industrial sectors are still active, churning out weaponry and civilian products alike. Furthermore, the apparatus of the Cyanolisian state, located in a collection of buildings and manors in the very center of the city, remains functional under the leadership of §YCountess Taillow Sumpkfiel§!, leading the County forwards through these dangerous and turbulent times.\n"

In 511 ALB, Prince Garle of Sydia sent his general, Drogus, to secure the northern frontier against §RZaphzan raiders§! by fortifying the riverbank. However, in 539 an ambitious warrior named Gobdan overthrew Drogus and declared himself §YPrince of Kivessin§!. Thus, the third principality of Prywhen was born.\n\nThanks to its location in the middle of the §YEvi Valley§!, in the confluence of rivers, Kivessin quickly grew into a city. It was sacked several times by Zaphzan griffons, but after §YEmperor Grover I's§! conquests in 705 peace and order were maintained on the frontier. When §YPrince Kloseu of Brodfeld§! declared himself king, he made Kivessin his capital due to its location, prestige and history.\n\nThe most notable sight in the city is the §YKing's Palace§!, which formerly was the home of the Kivessinian princes. It is built on the foundation of the fortress which Drogus founded centuries ago, and is the largest brick building in Griffonia. Other places of interest are the §YTemple of Eviliana§!, the primary center of worship for the eastern river-goddess, the old §YMarket Square§! with its medieval architecture, and the Chapterhouses of the local knighty orders.\n\nIn recent years the outskirts of the city have been demolished and rebuilt anew, with modern apartment buildings and factories rising high above the low buildings of the historic center. This clash between old and new is one of the most striking features of the city."

When §YPrince Kloseu of Brodfeld§! united Prywhen, he considered making Sydia his capital before ultimately choosing Kivessin. To this day, Sydia functions as the second capital of the realm.\n\nIts location near the mouth of the river and its natural harbour have always been the keys to its success as a city. Tonnes of grain, rice, timber, honey and other products from all of Evi Valley are brought here and exported to distant lands. Numerous fishergriffs depart the docks every day and bring countless fish for sale at the city's famed Seaside Market. The headquarters of the Prywhenian Merchants' Association is located nearby, as is the old Princely Palace which functioned as the summer residence of the King.\n\nSydia is a maritime city, as shown by the countless sailing ships and steam boats in its harbour and the constant squarking of seagulls. Indeed, legend says the last Princess of Sydia was a sailor herself, and sailed off into the sunset to discover distant lands, only to never return. The Prince of Brodfeld then inherited the vacant throne.\n\nWhile the population of Prywhen is largely homogenous, Sydia is an exception. Here one may find Wingbardians, Cyanolisians, Sicameonese and even members of other races such as Asterionese minotaurs, Macawian harpies and Colthaginian zebras. When walking in the alleys in the warm evening, one may hear a dozen languages spoken as customers haggle for better prices."

Behind them many-pillared halls of stone, with high golden roofs and silver floors stretch for countless miles deep under the ground, lit by lamps of crystal that shine like stars and the sun. The vastness of this space is dwarfed only by the almighty mines that stretch out in unfathomable crevasse deep under the ground lined with bridges, ramps and mining tools. From these mines, gold and gemstones are gathered in vast quantities and carved and chiselled by ancient paws into treasures unlike any have seen. And these treasures sit in a vast hall under onyx and gold platforms in which a mighty carven throne stands, etched with crystals and runes of power, from which the §YKing of the Diamond Dogs rules§!. Forges of fire, hot enough to melt the stone itself, roar deep under the mountains in which weapons, armour and trinkets of all kinds are created by master-smiths working tirelessly day and night.\n\nDespite the grandeur, all this was §Rbuilt on the backbreaking work of slaves§!.

Down on the river, you can see barges and ships, all shipping goods around the §BRiverlands§!. Wine from Deponya and Lake City heading upriver to Wittenland. Enchanted goods and such in return heading downriver towards the western frontier of the Coalition. Look closely and you can even see Griffon traders hailing from the Empire at the docks to buy select goods to ship back home to §RGriffenheim§!, even when the alliance they are standing in was founded to resist them. And the ever-present customs houses dot the riverbanks on the Grifking, but also on the Gold River where cloud marble and vases are transferred to smaller boats that shoot across the rivers. The griffon traders on the docks have just handed over an unknown crate when you exit the bridge and enter the city itself on the Unija Cesta. Taking in the awe of the only real functioning representative democracy in the Riverlands, possibly the world and especially its capital with its wide avenues and boulevards, with lavish gardens showing the wealth that the city takes in. Look to the sky and you will see buildings that are almost themselves works of art. Take a turn left at the Central Railway Terminal and stare up the Avenija Republik towards the §YPalaca Rijeke§!. Formerly the royal residence, when Rijekograd was ruled by the Water Dynasty and its princesses it is today the beating heart of Rijekan democracy as the meeting place of the §YSabor§!.\n\nNow, when you enter the Palaca Rijeke as a visitor, you will see paintings and frescos of the old dynasty, of how they led the city to independence, how they expanded their realm, and how they eventually fell in Wittenland. Follow the paintings and frescos up and down the palace, through the public corridors and see the story of Rijekograd from its inception to the present day. Enter the Sabor itself, and you would, under most circumstances see representative democracy in action. Under most circumstances that is. As of 1007, it is the site of some of the most hilarious political debates in known memory, with the incumbent Chancellor, §MRiver Swirl§! and her political nemesis, §MNova Whirl§!, frequently trading insults in the chamber. But anyways. Exit the Palaca Rijeke and follow the promenade along the Green River to the §YSoft Water Theatre§!. The site of some of the funniest comedies in the Riverlands, it is also, coincidentally the site of a local legend of an old actor haunting the place after dying in an accident involving a sandbag, three rat tails and a roasted turkey. He haunts the place hunting for the person who killed him, moving around random seats and chandeliers in the audience. Of course, one of the theatre companies that inhabits the theatre is known to be notorious tricksters, much to the irritation of the resident orchestra and scenographers in the theatre. Can't win them all and all that. See their production, 'The Battle of Coltstream' and laugh your way through the satires of the Water Dynasty and their portrayal of them while munching on the provided snacks.\n\nWhen you're done there, if there's still time in the day and you arrived at the right time, you should have time to grab a hoofball game after grabbing the streetcar to the stadium. While the River Games are unfortunately as of time of writing still a concept on paper, the local leagues are still good enough for most purposes. Be sure to avoid the hooligans though. They do not look kindly on ponies from outside their little city. But on the contrary, the stadium sells some great hayfries and hayburgers, and you should under all circumstances if you are there.\n\nWith the tense political atmosphere descending on Rijekograd, the next few years in this city will be very interesting indeed.

Nothing remains of this legendary building, but at least the §MGreat Library§! founded by his successors still stands.\n\nAfter the decline and stagnation of Wittenland, the city has fallen behind as well. The northern cities of Jezeragrad, Bakara, Rijekograd and others now surpass it in size and prosperity. In the beginning of the millenium, the city still lacked proper lighting and sewage, while in the north the first telegraph wires already connected the cities. However, the reforms of §YQueen White Star§! have done much to drag the city to modernity, albeit at the cost of many old buildings that were simply too dilapidated to be renovated. Such is the price of progress, and most inhabitants of the city have accepted it, except for the Mage-Nobles.\n\nAside from the Great Library, which has one of the largest collections of books in the entire world, there is the Royal Palace, an elaborate stone castle decorated with shining crystals, the Old Bridge across the Grifking river that leads to the small Pònaidh town of Ceann Tòrr, the Merchants' District on the banks of the river near the bridge (where one may find many fine textiles from Pònaidhean) and the luxurious manors of the Mage-Nobles. On the outskirts of the city are the slums inhabited by non-unicorns, who are the lowest of the low in Wittenland society."
