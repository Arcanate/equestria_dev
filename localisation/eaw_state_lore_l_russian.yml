И все же, глядя на яркую жизнь в городе: кафе, рестораны, театры, вечеринки и прочие развлечения становится ясно, что Кантерлот, как и остальная часть Эквестрии, двинулся дальше, довольный мыслью, что вторжение чейнджлингов было плохим, но разовым событием, которое больше никогда не повторится. Меньше всего кто-либо ожидает возвращения §RКоролевы Кризалис§!. Но какой бы ни была история, Кантерлот идёт в ногу с остальной частью страны. Как Эквестрия, так и Кантерлот развивались в первые годы совместного правления Луны и Селестии. Когда Эквестрия проходила через индустриализацию, то же случалось и с Кантерлотом. Когда Луну радушно приняли обратно, то же произошло и в Кантерлоте. Будь то битва с Найтмэр Мун или с чейнджлингами, на протяжении большей части своей истории Кантерлот - яркая столица Эквестрии, дом пони и гармонии под пристальным взором принцессы Селестии, всегда был срезом Эквестрии и показывал её состояние.\n\nНо если возьмёте билет на поезд и прибудете во дворец, то увидите, что учебная программа в Школе одаренных единорогов осталась такой же, какой она была всегда, и что гала-концерты следуют одному и тому же сценарию уже на протяжении десятилетий. Хотя сейчас это может хорошо служить Эквестрии, всё это устарело для современной эпохи и давно нуждается в капитальном обновлении. Однако, если на Кантерлот обрушится шторм, это будет действительно ужасно.\n\nВремя покажет, что случится с Кантерлотом, когда в мире наступит новая эра. Эпоха возможностей и рисков."

Many crystal ponies inhabit the city and imports from the north are always on sale.\n\nWhinnyapolis surpassed its smaller twin Riverpool during the Industrial Revolution.

However, several decades ago the bustling city §Yvanished into thin air§!, and no one knew why. It remained a mystery until relatively recently.\n\n§GPrincess Twilight Sparkle§! managed to find the hidden city and break the curse that had made it vanish. She learned that a wizard named §YComet Tail the Starry-Eyed§! had cast a spell to protect the many books of the city from harm, but because he did the ritual at the wrong time, it ended up hiding the city entirely from outsiders. She cast the spell at the right time, breaking the curse and revealing the city. The ponies living in it, who had become reclusive over the years, were overjoyed when visitors flooded Bales.\n\nAt the present Bales is a center of learning, trade and book printing, producing ever more tomes not only for its own libraries, but for all the libraries of Equestria.

The first pony inhabitants of the area were part of the §YApple Family§!, who were granted the land as a gift by §YPrincess Celestia§! herself almost a century ago. The first apple orchards were planted, but while the trees grew, the ponies discovered magical §MZap Apples§! inside the Everfree Forest. The jam prepared from these apples became famous, attracting many migrants. Stinkin' Rich, the grandfather of the entrepreneur Filthy Rich, opened a market selling the jam, which soon grew into a burgeoining business. The Apple and Rich families still live in the town to this day, and are honoured as its founders.\n\nIn the years since, many ponies have moved to Ponyville, making it a very diverse town. All three races are present and live together in harmony. It is for this reason why Princess Celestia sent her young pupil, §YTwilight Sparkle§!, to live in the town and make some friends. She and the ponies she met soon became close friends and the wielders of the §YElements of Harmony§!, who have saved Equestria from countless threats. After her ascension into Alicornhood and her defeat of §RLord Tirek§!, Twilight Sparkle now lives in the §MCastle of Friendship§! north of the town.

It also has the largest §MWeather Factory§! in Equestria, for pegasi are responsible for weather management. The clouds, rainbows and snowflakes made in the town are distributed all across the nation. Another notable feature is the §YCloudeseum§!, where the annual Best Young Flyer competition is held.

Originally a small fishing settlement, it industrialized and grew rapidly, mostly thanks to its natural harbour. It became a center of shipping and manufacturing with thriving docks.\n\nHowever, the workers have been treated worse than in many other Equestrian cities. Because of this Baltimare became the center of the Equestrian labour movement, housing the headquarters of the CAN-TER anarcho-syndicalist federation of trade unions and anarchists. A large protest had been held in the city during the Winter Revolution in Stalliongrad, and the mayor of the city had been sacked by Celestia herself.\n\nDue to being located in the South-East, the city also houses a considerable minority of thestrals, whose conditions are even worse than that of the workers, but who are not allowed to join unions.

The landscape around the city is barren and the air in the settlement itself is difficult to breathe. Yet it is also a prospering town, producing a large amount of gold, coal, sulfur, tin, copper, platinum, gemstones and more.\n\nIts inhabitants are grim-faced, their faces often covered in soot, but hard-working and relentless.

A large portion of the populace consists of Olenian deer, who work on the docks or sell their wares at the markets. There are even some changelings living in the city, though they are viewed with suspicion by the rest of the inhabitants.\n\nIn recent years the dock workers and sailors of the city have unionized and now agitate for better rights.

Yet it never forgot its roots, being surrounded by farmland and having food processing and transportation as its economic foundations. An important railway leading to §YVanhoover§! passes through the city, and is used to transport countless bags of grain and other farm produce for export. The city is especially famous for its bread, said to be the best in Equestria.\n\nNotable sights include the centuries-old Tall Bridge, the Farmers' Market in the central square of the city, and the Museum of Agriculture.

Unsurprisingly, many inhabitants of the town are part of the vast Apple family. It is governed by §YSheriff Silverstar§! who maintains law and order. The town has a saloon known as the Salt Block, a clock tower and a stage for musical performances. It is known for its horse-drawn horse-drawn carriages and local mild west dances.\n\nIn 1001 ALB, Appleloosa was at the epicenter of the short but violent conflict known as the §RApple War§!. It erupted after nearby buffalo tribes demanded the ponies to tear down their orchards, for they had been planted on their traditional stampeding grounds. The ponies refused to destroy their livelihoods and the buffalo attacked. Compromise was only reached when Chief Thunderhooves was downed by an apple pie, which he found to be delicious. Soon a historic agreement was signed: The ponies get to keep their orchards, as long as they gift apple pies to the buffalo."

To this day, the ponies of the Neighua live in the city like their ancestors did.\n\nSurrounding Tenochtitlan is a vast network of canals, gaining their water from the river which flows past the city. On these canals, as well as the river itself, one may find the famed §GFloating Gardens§! -- or what remains of them, at least. The natives still use them to grow plants such as maize, beans and flowers, though many of them are overgrown.\n\nIn the center of the city itself stands the imposing §YPyramid of the Sun§!, the primary religious site of the Neighua. Although it has seen far less use under Celestia's rule (and no sacrifices whatsoever), locals still use it to affirm their loyalty to the Princess. In return, she provides modern medicine, fertilizer, machine tools and more, albeit the natives are left alone to live their peaceful lives in the traditional manner, in huts of stone, mud and wood."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_short_30:0 "Ayacachtli"
state_lore_text_container_state_name_30:0 "The §YCity§! of the §YMoon§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_30:0 "There is a charm in the city of Ayacachtli that begets wonderous thoughts in anypony; here is a city, that was ancient before Equestria had even been formed. Located in the southern jungles, in the mountains on the border of Badlands, Ayacachtli has the dubious honour of being the oldest thestral city in the world. Legends hold it, that it was constructed by a thestral Moonspeaker with the aid of an Ursa Major. Historians, however, place its origins to many millenia ago, to the times when thestral tribes and the Neighua came into conflict and a need for a safe haven was born. Whatever it may have been, thestrals have been living in the city for so long, that only bare estimates can be given with current historical records.\n\nQuite an unusual aspect about Ayacachtli is the fact it is located inside the mountain range, inside a cast cavern dug over time by its denizens. Even as times have advanced, majority of the city is still located safely there, with just part of the more modern city located outside. Where, along with them, plenty of terraces for farming are located to feed the mountain city. But it is not food that Ayacachtli is known for; for the mountains contain many riches such as copper, silver and gold. Historians have traced many ancient trade routes leading to Ayacachtli from the north, carrying goods such as iron weapons and armour in exchange for the mined minerals. Evidence shows that Ayacachtli served as a vital link for trade between the jungles and north, through which luxury goods such as sugar and cocoa from jungle tribes passed by. Once the princesses proceeded with their formation of Equestria, Ayacachtli found itself in a favourable position - at least until the incident with Nightmare Moon occured. Now shunned, the thesrals returned to living amongs themselves, in fear of respitals and revenge for siding with the horrid monster that had once been their beloved princess. This especially hurt Ayacachtli and the city endured for centuries as but a hollow shell of a once mighty realm.\n\nToday, Ayacachtli stands as a testament for vigority of thestralkind as a near total majority of its denizens are made up of thestrals. Even the ponies there are usually tribals from the jungles, who have interacted with the thestrals far longer than any northener has and even tend to share a common tongue with. Modernization is present in the city but mixed in to tradition and the peculiar aspects of thestrals; Ayacachtli has no real streets, as near-every denizen can fly. This has led to the city developing not horitzontally as a traditional city but primarily vertically. Tall towers, reaching from the cavern's ceiling to the floor, dot the vast cave, with the odd bridge crossing the gaps between them. Even with modern electricity, most of Ayacachtli is cast in but dim light, to better suit the sensitive eyes of thestrals. Further caverns extend out from the main one, which lead to the many mining tunnels; Ayacachtli even to this day is mostly dependant upon its ore exports to many Equestrian industries north; one could perhaps find some irony in how some things never change.\n\nCentral part of the city and an aspect that cannot be missed is the Temple of Moon, located at the city's center and remains a staunchly visited complex by the thestrals. It is the place where every Moonspeaker comes to learn the traditional ways and read the ancient texts stored within there. Some said to more than millenia old but no outsiders are permitted to see them, not even a certain Princess of Books. But what a visitor can see is already extraordinary, and a sight to rival even that of Canterlot. For right past its entrance, visitors are met with a giant dome covering the main hall. On this dome there is a vividly well-detailed star map, one born from countless generations of work from the Moonspeakers. Every possible inch of the carved stone accurately details the wonders of the night sky to the point that astronomers from Princess Luna's Academy of Stars have praised the meticulous work the priests have done, even rivalling achievements historical astronomers such as Galloping Galley and Leap Ordinance. There have been calls to preserve the temple complex for sake of history but for thestrals, however, the temple still serves its original purpose, as it did since its inception; to venerate the Moon, as their forebears did before them. A work that continues on, and will do so for more millenia to come."

The other denisens of the forest are far less friendly than her.\n\nUnlike in rest of Equestria, weather and nature in the Everfree Forest are outside the influence and caretaking of ponykind. Clouds move on their own, gnarly and thorny plants grow without limits, and fearsome beasts stalk the shadows. Groves of Poison Joke and nests of Parasprites lure the unwary traveller to their doom.\n\nGetting lost in the Everfree Forest is the nightmare of any pony living near it. Those who dare to travel through it do it as quickly as they can and are prepared to fight for their lives. It is a magical, cursed place, and so far the advances of technology have provided no means to tame it."

But those days of splendour ended when Luna was consumed by jealousy and became §RNightmare Moon§! who tried to slay her beloved sister. Much of the castle was destroyed and Luna was banished to the Moon, but Celestia was overcome with sorrow. She and the entire court abandoned the castle, leaving behind painful memories.\n\nThe §YElements of Harmony§! remained in the castle before Nightmare Moon's return, after which they were retrieved by the Wielders of the Elements.

Within centuries, it was one of the largest cities in Equestria, a thriving center of industry always covered in thick smog, especially during cold winters.\n\nYet the growth of the city had a dark side. Its workers were mistreated and discontent grew. Due to its distance from the capital, Princess Celestia remained unaware of the tension before it was too late. The workers revolted, inspired by the writings of Caramel Marks and led by §RSteel Stallion§!, and seceded from Equestria in the Winter Revolution.\n\nAfter Steel Stallion died from illness, the Supreme Soviet renamed Princessyn to §RStalliongrad§!, which remains the city's name to this day. Nowadays Stalliongrad is a proletarian city, with any remains of capitalism erased.

From this strategically important warm-water port, the resources and goods produced inland are shipped abroad.\n\nDespite two revolutions, the Industrial revolution and the Winter revolution, the city retains its classical look especially in its historic city center, with most buildings made out of brick and stone. Countless monuments dot the city, the most notable one being the §YBronze Horse§!, a statue depicting Tsar Peter. On the outskirts of the city are more modern apartment blocks and industrial factories.\n\nAlongside Princessyn, now known as §RStalliongrad§!, Saint Petershoof was another major center of resistance which sparked the Winter Revolution. The sailors in the city's naval base mutinied and revolted against the Princess' rule and seized control of the city with the help of factory workers, joining the newly formed §RSoviet Republic§! afterwards. There have been talks of demolishing the "monarchist" monuments of the city, but their cultural and historical value have so far been deemed too significant."

They discovered the magically-extracted cutie marks being stored in a vault. When the inhabitants had realized Starlight was a fraud and see how much happier ponies with cutie marks are, they lost faith in equalism and drove Starlight out of town.\n\nNowadays the town is a peaceful and pleasant place, with every pony being proud of their talents.

Yet ever since Yakyakistan ended its long isolation from the world, one may see an occasional imported industrial product from Equestria which is out of place, and those who use them are disdained by others. This signals a deeper division in Yak society, which recently caused the Jak secession.\n\nThe most notable landmarks of the town are the two giant statues at its entrance, depicting a yak and a jak holding shields and torches, symbolising the unity of the two tribes. After the devastating avalanche of 1005, they were the only structures left standing, as the rest of the city had to be rebuilt from nothing with Equestrian aid. When walking on the snowy streets, one may hear the loud music of the yovidaphone, or the sound of yaks smashing objects for their personal enjoyment."

However, before 1002 ALB, it did not even exist.\n\nOver a thousand years ago, Crystal City was founded as the capital of the Empire, ruled by Princess Amore, the first ruler. Back then, the annual tradition of the Crystal Faire was established, and the magical §MCrystal Heart§! discovered. Together, these two kept the ponies' spirits high, and protected the city from §RUmbrum§! and the cold north. But then §RKing Sombra§! slew the Princess and seized power, forcefully moving much of the populace into the City to work as slaves. Equestria intervened, and before his defeat Sombra cast a curse on the Empire, making it disappear for a thousand years.\n\nAfter the end of the curse and the return of the city, the locals have had difficulty adapting to modernity. But thanks to Equestria's aid and the rulership of Princess Cadance, the city is industrialising quickly, with cars driving on the shining crystal streets.\n\nNotable sights of the city include the Crystal Castle, home of the royalty which houses the Crystal Heart, the Amethyst University with its grand library, the famed Spa, and lastly, the huge Crystal Stadium."

Prosperity came to its cloudy hills and plains, but when the Griffonian Empire arrived, the Duchy slowly fell into decline. Cloudbury became decrepit and reliant on Imperial aid, and when the Empire fell, economic and social depression took its toll on the city.\n\nHowever, when Alexander Kemerskai, exiled President-Marshal of the Griffonian Republic arrived, he revitalized Cloudbury as a center of his new Republic in the North. Cloudbury was urbanized and reformed, and Republican exiles poured into the city, leading to it becoming one of the first Republican cities to reach over 50% Herzlander literacy. Although smog now blots out much of the pleasant cloudy skies of Cloudbury and those speaking Cloudburian are seldom seen, it has become a bustling center of industry, and its close proximity to many rivers has allowed it to ferry trade west to the greater Republican ports."

He chose the marshland in the confluence of the grand §YGrifking river§! and put thousands of prisoners of war to work draining it. Within a decade Griffenheim had become a rapidly growing center of trade, administration, religion and industry. Even the §YArchonate of Boreas§! was moved from Griffonstone to Griffenheim, a decision which remains controversial to this day.

There are dozens of them, with the latest one being a railway bridge commissioned by Emperor Grover V.\n\nThe capital of the Empire retains the massive state apparatus and the infrastructure required to support it, despite the greatly diminished size of the nation. §YThe Imperial Palace§! is the beating heart of the city, a huge collection of ornate buildings dedicated to housing the Emperor and his vast court. Near it are countless ministries and bureaucratic offices, green gardens and parks, army barracks and famed military academies.
