 FRN_crisis_in_wingbardy_desc:0 "Ever since the brutal Falcor War, Wingbardy has been in various degrees of turmoil. Now the infamous fascist, Guilio Beakolini, is preparing a march on Karthin while communists riot on the streets. We are closely tied to Wingbardy, but the fate of our ally stands on the edge of a knife. Yet all we can do is wait, and hope for the best."

 ### Events
 francistria.1.t:0 "The Council Convenes"
 francistria.1.d:0 "The political situation in Wingbardy is finally being resolved. Yet it remains unclear how Francistria itself will be affected. Some fear that Wingbardy's influence will grow too strong, while others think a new golden age will await as long as Francistrians trust in their Wingbardian friends. There are many different opinions and debates among the country's nobility, so to come to an agreement the most influential nobles have agreed to meet at Francistria. The young Count is invited as well, though he is not expected to influence the decision making much.\n\nThe Martlewing Castle, standing upon a hill next to the city of Francistria proper, soon received some prestigious visitors: Lady Bianca of Eatela, whose ladyship was small but prosperous, Baron Dante of Roameo, known for his parties and charms but also for the poverty of his forested lands, Viscountess Ippolita of Goldenfeather, the breadbasket of the country, and last but not least, Governor-General Vittorio Felice of Tarrin. Francis came to meet them, though was too shy to say a word.\n\nAfter a formal dinner, the five gathered in a chamber to discuss what Francistria should do with Wingbardy. The Governor-General and the Viscountess both advocated maintaining close relations to the southern ally, while the Lady of Eatela said Francistria had relied on Wingbardy too long and should secede from the Karthinian Pact before it was too late. The Baron had fallen asleep, but when he woke up, said "What have those damn Wingbardians ever done for us? Where was the King when Falcor burned down Roameo? I say we're better off without those buggers."\n\nThe nobles' council erupted into shouting and arguing, with the Lady claiming the Governor-General and Viscountess both personally benefited from Wingbardy and disregarded its negative influence on Francistria. Count Francis remained silent, and even considered hiding behind the table. But then the council went silent and turned to look at him. They were at a deadlock, with two on each side. Francis could cast the deciding vote and resolve the situation. And so, he awkwardly stuttered:"
