 FRN_crisis_in_wingbardy_desc:0 "Ever since the brutal Falcor War, Wingbardy has been in various degrees of turmoil. Now the infamous fascist, Guilio Beakolini, is preparing a march on Karthin while communists riot on the streets. We are closely tied to Wingbardy, but the fate of our ally stands on the edge of a knife. Yet all we can do is wait, and hope for the best."
 FRN_allies_not_subjects:0 "Allies, Not Subjects"
 FRN_allies_not_subjects_desc:0 "Long have we been Wingbardy's friends, but in recent decades this relationship has turned increasingly sour. Wingbardian companies dominate Francistrian economy, Wingbardian culture overwhelms any native traditions, and worst of all, the troubels of Wingbardy affect us directly. Francistria must distance itself, without angering their powerful allies."

 ### Leader descriptions
 FRN_coward_count_desc:0 "Giosé Debolino, whose regnal name is Francis IX, is the most unusual Count of Francistria in its history. He was the third child of Francis VIII's younger brother, and the only legitimate heir when the previous Count perished unexpectedly in the Falcor War. No one ever expected him to hold any important position, so his parents had given him little attention. In fact, the only attention he ever received from others was abuse and mockery because of his stuttering, which made him withdrawn and shy.\n\nUnlike his predecessors, Francis is not a proud and loud warrior. He is quiet and prefers to spend time in his private chambers or in the woods near Martlewing Castle, undisturbed by servants and officials. As such, the nobility, fascists and the Tarrin resistance all see their chance to gain power at the expense of the weak and pathetic Count, who will never amount to anything."
 FRN_angry_bird_desc:0 "Gherita Zarfatti is a veteran of the Falcor War, leader of the fascist LPF, rumoured mistress of Beakolini and, last but not least, a journalist and an art critic with a refined taste. She is the rising star of Francistrian politics, closely cooperating with Beakolini at all times. Her ultimate dream is Risorgimento, unification of all Wingbardian-speaking lands under one nation. She considers Tarrin to be a Wingbardian-speaking land, despite 86% of its population speaking Aquileian as their primary language. As an expert propagandist, she is convincing more and more Francistrians to share this belief."

 ### Events
 francistria.1.t:0 "The Council Convenes"
 francistria.1.d:0 "It remains unclear how Francistria itself will be affected by Wingbardy's crisis. Some fear that Wingbardy will radicalize, while others think a new golden age will await as long as Francistrians trust in their Wingbardian friends. There are many different opinions and debates among the country's nobility, so to come to an agreement the most influential nobles have agreed to meet at Francistria. The young Count is invited as well, though he is not expected to influence the decision making much.\n\nThe Martlewing Castle, standing upon a hill next to the city of Francistria proper, soon received some prestigious visitors: Lady Bianca of Eatela, whose ladyship was small but prosperous, Baron Dante of Roameo, known for his parties and charms but also for the poverty of his forested lands, Viscountess Ippolita of Goldenfeather, the breadbasket of the country, and last but not least, Governor-General Vittorio Felice of Tarrin. Francis came to meet them, though was too shy to say a word.\n\nAfter a formal dinner, the five gathered in a chamber to discuss what Francistria should do with Wingbardy. The Governor-General and the Viscountess both advocated maintaining close relations to the southern ally, while the Lady of Eatela said Francistria had relied on Wingbardy too long and should seek to reduce excessive Wingbardian influence. The Baron had fallen asleep, but when he woke up, said "What have those accursed Wingbardians ever done for us? Where was the King when Falcor burned down Roameo? They call us allies but treat us like a pet dog."\n\nThe nobles' council erupted into shouting and arguing, with the Governor-General and Viscountess accusing the others of endangering their vital relations, while the opponents said the two personally benefited from Wingbardy and disregarded its negative influence on Francistria. Count Francis remained silent, and even considered hiding under the table. But then the council went silent and turned to look at him. They were at a deadlock, with two on each side. Francis could cast the deciding vote and resolve the situation. And so, he awkwardly stuttered:"

 francistria.2.t:0 "Fascist March In Francistria City"
 francistria.2.d:0 "In support of Beakolini's march on Karthin, the paramilitary fascist organization LPF prepared its own, smaller-scale march in the center of Francistria City. Unlike Beakolini's PNF however, they did not plan to seize power in the nation. The march was organized to show solidarity to brothers and sisters in Wingbardy, and to display the ever-increasing power and influence of LPF.\n\nUnlike in Karthin, there was no opposition to their march when it began, or at any point during it. At most, only a several citizens threw some insults at the fascists, but most dared not anger them. The blackshirts marched in orderly columns like a military battalion, lead by the infamous Gherita Zarfatti. She had long been the leader of LPF and was rumoured to be Beakolini's mistress. Following her, the columns reached Martlewing Castle, and began to sing Giovinezza, a song favoured by Beakolini's fascists. Francis stayed inside and did not dare to go outside before they eventually left.\n\nIt seems there is nothing in the way of the fascists, so they can freely continue to pompously posture and attract new members."
 francistria.2.a:0 "Worrying..."
 francistria.3.t:0 "The Count's Burden"
 francistria.3.d:0 "The Count sat in his office, shuffling documents. Before, the Martlewings had always been absolute monarchs, but Francis IX usually delegated tasks to nobles. This time was an exception. Reforms regarding Francistria's relationship with Wingbardy felt too important. Talonuels had always been friends of Martlewings. It would simply add insult to injury if a Martlewing didn't oversee the changes himself. However, he had little knowledge of policy-making and diplomacy. He even barely knew how to read and write, having taught himself to do both as a child.\n\nThere was a knock on the door and Francis snapped out of his thoughts. The Lady and Baron had wanted to meet him and discuss about Wingbardy with him. Hesitantly, he got up and opened the door. The two nobles greeted him, happy that he had supported them in the council, but Francis remained stoic and silent. They all sat down.\n\n"S-so, um, what d-did you have in m-mind?" Francis asked with his stutter.\nThe Baron shrugged. "Nothing, personally. I honestly do not care for the entire matter. I was merely returning a favour to Lady Bianca in the council," he said and winked at her with a coy smile.\nShe rolled her eyes and presented a thick stack of papers. "I have an entire program for curtailing Wingbardian influence. You can trust me with this task."\n\n"A-actually," Francis said quietly, "I don't think I can let others handle this. I-it's too im-important. I have to-to do something m-myself for once."\n\nThe Baron lifted an eyebrow. The Lady sighed and clasped the Count's claw. "Poor Francis. Listen, don't pressure yourself into doing anything. I know how difficult this is for you. You were never supposed to be burdened so greatly."\n"Sor-ry, but I have t-to. I hope t-t-this doesn't offend you."\nShe shook her head. "No no, it's fine. But at the very least take advice from us. And do find someone capable to help you. You can't do this yourself, Francis dear."\nHe nodded slowly and even made brief eye contact with her."
