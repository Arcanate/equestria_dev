 ### Foci
 FRN_crisis_in_wingbardy:0 "Crisis In Wingbardy"
 FRN_crisis_in_wingbardy_desc:0 "Ever since the brutal Falcor War, Wingbardy has been in various degrees of turmoil. Now the infamous fascist, Guilio Beakolini, is preparing a march on Karthin while communists riot on the streets. We are closely tied to Wingbardy, but the fate of our ally stands on the edge of a knife. Yet all we can do is wait, and hope for the best."
 FRN_allies_not_subjects:0 "Allies, Not Subjects"
 FRN_allies_not_subjects_desc:0 "Long have we been Wingbardy's friends, but in recent decades this relationship has turned increasingly sour. Wingbardian companies dominate Francistrian economy, Wingbardian culture overwhelms any native traditions, and worst of all, the troubles of Wingbardy affect us directly. Francistria must distance itself without angering its powerful ally."
 FRN_cooperate_with_socialists:0 "Cooperate With PSA"
 FRN_cooperate_with_socialists_desc:0 "Partito Socialista Agrario, the agrarian socialist party, has always opposed Wingbardian influence and protests the rise of fascism. Count Francis thinks their ideas align with his own and considers asking for their assistance. This must be kept secret from the nobility and the blackwings of LPF, for they despise leftists."
 FRN_dismiss_wingbardian_advisors:0 "Dismiss Wingbardian Advisors"
 FRN_dismiss_wingbardian_advisors_desc:0 "While the aid of Wingbardian advisors is appreciated, it cannot be denied that their influence on our economy and military has grown too great. Instead of relying on Wingbardian investors to fund our economy and Wingbardian officers to manage our army, we must learn to fly with our own wings."
 FRN_nationalize_businesses:0 "Nationalize Wingbardian Businesses"
 FRN_nationalize_businesses_desc:0 "Wingbardian control over our economy needs to be curtailed. Local companies are unable to compete with foreign-owned behemoths such as Taloniel, which in turn drain money away from Francistria. PSA has proposed that we nationalize these companies, transferring their assets to state-owned ones. Francis has decided to compensate the foreigners in defiance of PSA."
 FRN_independent_army:0 "An Independent Army"
 FRN_independent_army_desc:0 "During the Falcor War the Francistrian army cooperated very closely with the Wingbardian one; so much so that it almost merged into it. However, in the end it is the army of Francistria, and not of Wingbardy. Our military command does not need to follow Wingbardian orders and we should not rely on Karthin to dictate our strategy and doctrine."
 FRN_defensive_doctrine:0 "Adopt A Defensive Doctrine"
 FRN_defensive_doctrine_desc:0 "During Francis VIII's reign, Francistria went on daring offensives several times. The end result? Unruly conquered land and a dead Count. Francis IX has no interest in replicating the military escapades of his predecessor. From now on, Francistria will focus on defending its borders. How, exactly, will soon be decided."
 FRN_meet_with_talonuel:0 "A Meeting With The King"
 FRN_meet_with_talonuel_desc:0 "The recent actions taken by the Count have not pleased our ally, the King of Wingbardy. If we wish to still remain in the Karthinian Pact, or worse, face direct intervention from Wingbardy in our internal affairs, the Count must meet with the King and mend our divides."
 FRN_protectionist_policy:0 "Implement Protectionist Policies"
 FRN_protectionist_policy_desc:0 "Lady Bianca has long complained that her companies cannot compete with cheap Wingbardian imports. Our own industry cannot grow for every domestic demand is already filled by foreigners. Clearly action must be taken to nurture the growth of our industry. Temporarily imposing tariffs and import quotas will limit the amount of foreign goods on our market."
 FRN_hire_condottieri:0 "Hire Condottieri"
 FRN_hire_condottieri_desc:0 "In the past, Francistria used to have a strong mercenary tradition, its roots being in Count Francis I's own motley band of adventurers and sellswords. While modern conscripted armies made most mercenaries obsolete, the Falcor War proves what a senseless waste of citizenry's lives war can be. We should once again hire mercenaries to train our troops and to die for us."
 FRN_school_in_every_village:0 "A School In Every Village"
 FRN_school_in_every_village_desc:0 "The previous Counts cared little for the education of the commoners. Count Francis IX knows however that we will remain a backwards nation until we ensure as many griffons as possible attain basic schooling. With the support of the PSA, he is now preparing a large-scale public project to establish a school in every settlement with over 250 inhabitants."
 FRN_minimum_wage:0 "Introduce Minimum Wage"
 FRN_minimum_wage_desc:0 "Cheap labour has long attracted Wingbardian companies to exploit our workers, and low wages mean most of our working populace is impoverished. Giacomo Dalleotti of PSA has advised Count Francis IX to implement laws to set a limit on how low wages can be, forcing employers to pay their workers fairly. This will reduce exploitation and increase the wealth of the commoners."
 FRN_import_substitution:0 "Import Substitution Industrialisation"
 FRN_import_substitution_desc:0 "Francistria has long been reliant on imports due to primarily producing raw goods for export such as grain and wine. With tariffs increasing price of foreign goods, we need to subsidize our own nascent manufacturing sector and invest in promising businesses. All this, along with improved education providing skilled workers, should gradually industrialise our nation."
 FRN_invest_domestic_arms_industry:0 "Invest In Domestic Arms Industry"
 FRN_invest_domestic_arms_industry_desc:0 "Wingbardian arms dealers have long supplemented our army with weapons of war, but we should not be so reliant on another country to provide for our troops. Instead, we should aim to be militarily self-sufficient, and this can be achieved by expanding our own arms industry by expanding arsenals and investing in our own companies."
 FRN_polytech_uni:0 "The Polytechnic University Of Eatela"
 FRN_polytech_uni_desc:0 "Cooperating closely with Lady Bianca, Count Francis IX is preparing to open a new educational facility in Eatela, specialised in educating a new generation of engineers. Many teachers have been hired both from Francistria and abroad, and they will ensure we will no longer have to rely on Wingbardian engineers to do everything for us."
 FRN_land_reform:0 "Limited Land Reform"
 FRN_land_reform_desc:0 "PSA has for many years now advocated for a comprehensive land reform, but the nobles of the Arengo have been uninterested. Now, with support from the Lady and the Baron, Count Francis IX can fulfill their wish and redistribute land from aristocrats to peasants. Of course, the nobles will retain most of their lands, but PSA and the commoners will be pleased nonetheless."
 FRN_aid_veterans:0 "Aid The Veterans"
 FRN_aid_veterans_desc:0 "Those griffons who bravely fought in the Falcor War were afterwards neglected by the government. This motivated many of them to join LPF, which provided them generous support. Now it is time we regain their loyalty by offering far greater aid than the LPF could ever afford to provide. We will remind them that their heroism has not been forgotten."
 FRN_fortify_borders:0 "Fortify Our Borders"
 FRN_fortify_borders_desc:0 "While most of our borders are for now secure, who knows what may happen in the future. The enemy may not just come from the north, but from the south as well. If we prepare now, we won't have to prepare later when it might already be too late. Extensive fortifications will be built on our borders to guard against any threat."
 FRN_invite_foreign_experts:0 "Invite Foreign Experts"
 FRN_invite_foreign_experts_desc:0 "We should not just look for talented individuals within Francistria or Wingbardy. By looking further, into other countries, we may find griffons - or even other creatures - who are eager to work for us and provide our Count with good advice. The LPF, of course, won't be pleased, but the Count cares little for their opinion nowadays."
 FRN_francistrian_identity:0 "Revive Francistrian Identity"
 FRN_francistrian_identity_desc:0 "Ever since Count Francis II befriended Wingbardy, there has been a continuous effort to "wingbardize" Francistrian lands. In reality, the griffons of our nation had a distinct identity separate from that of Wingbardians, and it could be argued that our dialect is closer to Tarrinian than Wingbardian. We must revive our own culture and stop thinking that we are Wingbardians!"
 FRN_blood_of_martlewings:0 "Blood Of The Martlewings"
 FRN_blood_of_martlewings_desc:0 "Count Francis IX has long felt like he is not a true Martlewing. But it cannot be denied that the blood of his ancestors flows in his veins. Deep inside him is buried a proud warrior with a strong will. Lately, this has become more and more evident as the Count's confidence grows. Now, he wishes to learn martial matters and participate in our army's leadership."
 FRN_develop_roameo:0 "Develop Roameo"
 FRN_develop_roameo_desc:0 "The Barony of Roameo is by far the most backwater and underdeveloped region in Francistria. So far we have allowed Baron Dante to mismanage the area as he pleases, but no more. Count Francis IX has decided to invest extensively into Roameo to drag it out of poverty and backwardness. Baron Dante should be pleased, and his subjects even more so."
 FRN_engineer_corps:0 "Establish Engineer Corps"
 FRN_engineer_corps_desc:0 "The construction of new fortifications required us to employ many engineers, who now wish to continue to serve the County. Therefore Francis IX has decided to form a new branch of the military comprised entirely of engineers. They will be responsible not only for constructing defences, but also bridges and camps, as well for demolishing structures and clearing terrain obstacles."
 FRN_restore_count_authority:0 "Restore The Count's Authority"
 FRN_restore_count_authority_desc:0 "Francistria was always an absolute monarchy, and the word of the Martlewings was law. This only changed with the death of Francis VIII. Now, his confidence constantly growing, Francis IX has finally decided to limit the power of the Arengo and regain his rightful authority in the County. The nobles will once again be relegated to an advisory role. Long live the Count!"
 FRN_a_proposal:0 "Propose A Marriage"
 FRN_a_proposal_desc:0 "So far our Count has lacked a consort and has ruled the country by himself, with aid from advisors. But he should marry, not only to have someone by his side, but also to secure his bloodline. The succession crisis that followed the death of Francis VIII must not happen again. Fortunately, Count Francis IX already has the perfect griffoness in mind. All that remains to be done is to propose."
 FRN_peasant_militia:0 "Form Peasant Militias"
 FRN_peasant_militia_desc:0 "Giacomo Dalleotti of PSA has proposed that we provide arms and basic training to the peasantry of our country, so that they can participate in defence against possible invaders. The rural nobles, of course, are not fond of this idea, but at this point they are powerless to stop Francis IX, who is in favour of arming the peasants."
 FRN_talk_to_angry_bird:0 "Talk Sense Into LPF"
 FRN_talk_to_angry_bird_desc:0 "The LPF keep protesting the Count's decisions, complaining about almost everything he does. Count Francis IX has run out of patience, but instead of using force, he has decided to use words. A private meeting will be arranged between the Count and the leader of the LPF, Gherita Zarfatti. Perhaps he can manage to make them realize the error of their ways."
 FRN_frexit:0 "Frexit?"
 FRN_frexit_desc:0 "Despite our best attempts at diplomacy, Wingbardy continues to attempt to exert its influence over us. While we have been allies for centuries, perhaps it is finally time to end it, to safeguard our precious sovereignty. We can still retain cordial relations as long as [WNG.GetLeader] is reasonable. However, it is dangerous to go alone, so Count Francis IX must consider carefully."
 FRN_curtail_privileges:0 "Curtail Noble Privileges"
 FRN_curtail_privileges_desc:0 "The numerous nobility of Francistria has enjoyed exclusive privileges even before Count Francis I's conquests, which placed them above fellow griffons. They have traditionally been exempt from taxation, have special rights in commerce and ownership, and so on. Social mobility was hampered and our development stagnated. Now, Count Francis IX has decided to bring an end to this injustice."
 FRN_the_counts_speech:0 "The Count's Speech"
 FRN_the_counts_speech_desc:0 "For the first time during his reign, Count Francis IX has decided to hold a public speech addressing the nation. It will be broadcast on radio to every household that owns one, and will concern the future of the nation. It remains to be seen if the Count can keep his stutter under control during the speech, however."
 
 FRN_trust_in_wingbardy:0 "Trust In Our Friends"
 FRN_trust_in_wingbardy_desc:0 "We have been Wingbardy's trusted allies for centuries, even before the rise of the Empire. While our relationship is not perfect, we have vowed to stand by their side no matter what happens. In return, we expect them to aid us as much as we aided them. The Karthinian Pact is a reciprocal alliance. All we need to do is ask, and we shall be given anything we want."
 FRN_request_help_from_knights:0 "Request Help From The Knights"
 FRN_request_help_from_knights_desc:0 "The Knights of the Trinity are an order sworn to protect the practitioners of their unorthodox faith. However, they also loyally serve the Count in return for his patronage. Their efforts during the Falcor War were valiant, but now in this time of instability we need them once again. We should persuade the Count to ask for their assistance."
 FRN_consult_wingbardian_advisors:0 "Consult Wingbardian Advisors"
 FRN_consult_wingbardian_advisors_desc:0 "Wingbardy has generously provided us with talented griffons who are eager to improve the economy and the military of our nation. Instead of sidelining them, we need their valuable advice if we wish Francistria to become a fully functional modern nation. They shall guide the Arengo (and the Count of course) and help them draft sensible policies."
 FRN_cooperate_with_companies:0 "Collaborate With Talonieli"
 FRN_cooperate_with_companies_desc:0 "Talonieli is a major Wingbardian company specializing in manufacturing tools and making steel. In recent years they have expanded their operations into Francistria, opening several steelworks in the capital. We should seek to work together with them directly and subsidize them, allowing them to open new factories and supply our nation with tools and machinery."
 FRN_expand_military_cooperation:0 "Expand Military Cooperation"
 FRN_expand_military_cooperation_desc:0 "Ever since our independence from the Empire, we've worked closely together with Wingbardy on the matters of military. We stood side by side during the Falcor War and learned a great deal from that harrowing experience. Wingbardy's army has modernized rapidly in the years since, and we have fallen behind. We need to deepen our cooperation if we wish to be on par with our allies."
 FRN_eliminate_trade_barriers:0 "Eliminate Trade Barriers"
 FRN_eliminate_trade_barriers_desc:0 "Viscountess Ippolita has long demanded the removal of any remaining tolls and restrictions on trade with foreign countries. She has greatly enriched her lands already by exporting food, so her desire is understandable. Not only that, but our economic advisors say that free trade is the key to quick economic growth. Therefore we should minimize government interference on commerce."
 
 FRN_designate_flnt_as_terrorist:0 "Designate FLNT As Terrorists"
 FRN_designate_flnt_as_terrorist_desc:0 "LPF is right in its allegations that FLNT is a ruthless terrorist organization bent on causing havoc. They do not just target our soldiers, but civilians too, and even Tarrinians have perished in their bombings. How can they claim to fight for Tarrin if they kill their own people? From this day on, the government will officially recognize FLNT as terrorists, and treat them accordingly."
 FRN_confiscate_assets:0 "Confiscate Rebel Assets"
 FRN_confiscate_assets_desc:0 "Several investigations have come to the conclusion that certain Tarrinian business owners are secretly providing support for the terrorists. This is an act of treason, and we are thusly justified to arrest them seize their property. Anything we take will be transferred into Francistria proper to keep it away from the claws of the rebels."
 FRN_conscript_locals:0 "Conscript Locals"
 FRN_conscript_locals_desc:0 "FLNT is more than happy to attack Francistrian soldiers, but if we conscript local Tarrinians and give them the task of guarding the populace from terror attacks, then their motivation should reduce sharply. We should, of course, try to find volunteers first, but if that proves to be insufficient we can simply force Tarrinians into military duty. It won't be popular, but it will dissuade the rebels."
 FRN_fortify_aquileian_border:0 "Fortify The Aquileian Border"
 FRN_fortify_aquileian_border_desc:0 "There is no doubt that FLNT is getting support from the Aquileian republican movement. The border controls have been too lax for the sake of trade, but now we have to impose restrictions and construct fortifications to prevent cooperation between Aquileians and Tarrinians. This will also make it easier to defend against Aquileia should they decide to "liberate" Tarrin."
 FRN_villagization_program:0 "Villagization Program"
 FRN_villagization_program_desc:0 "Another source of support for the terrorists is the Tarrinian rural population. Rebels can easily hide among the peasants and receive generous supplies when needed. Not only that, but FLNT is spreading false propaganda in the countryside to get recruits and to turn the populace against us. If we wish to bring an end to terrorist activity, something drastic must be done."
 FRN_suppress_tarrinian:0 "Suppress Tarrinian Language"
 FRN_suppress_tarrinian_desc:0 "If we wish to more easily assimilate Tarrin into our domain, we need to make sure our language replaces their own. The transition shouldn't be too difficult as Francistrian language is already similar to theirs. From now on, Tarrinian will be forbidden entirely from official and public use, forcing local newspapers, officials and roadsigns to exclusively use Francistrian."
 FRN_ennoble_vittorio:0 "Ennoble Vittorio"
 FRN_ennoble_vittorio_desc:0 "Governor-General Vittorio Felice has done a fine job over the years, maintaining order in Tarrin and fighting against the insidiuous resistance movement. Not only that, but he already has a seat on the Arengo, and is a noble in all but name. It is time we reward him for his valiant deeds and make him the Margrave of Tarrin. This will also ease the integration of the region into our governance."
 FRN_grant_land_to_colonists:0 "Grant More Land To Colonists"
 FRN_grant_land_to_colonists_desc:0 "The quickest and easiest way to integrate a territory is to populate it with loyal colonists who will represent our interests in the region. We have encouraged migration for years already, but by offering free land and providing generous subsidies we can encourage thousands of Francistrians to move to Tarrin. Of course, we will compensate the previous owners of appropriated land."
 FRN_integrate_tarrin:0 "The Perfect Fusion"
 FRN_integrate_tarrin_desc:0 "Tarrin has been under our control for long enough. It is time we formally make it an integral, indivisible part of the Francistrian nation, placing local administration directly under our control. The FLNT's stubborn resistance might continue, but there's nothing they can do to stop us from assimilating our rightful land. We will defend Tarrin to the last drop of peasant blood!"
 
 FRN_negotiate_with_flnt:0 "Open Negotiations With FLNT"
 FRN_negotiate_with_flnt_desc:0 "It is clear to us that the violence in Tarrin will not end unless we express our willingness to resolve the matter peacefully. While negotiations are likely to take years, it's preferable to continued bloodshed without end in sight. Of course, opening talks with FLNT means recognizing their legitimacy, but that will likely please the local populace more than anything."
 
 FRN_charity_for_needy:0 "Charity For The Needy"
 FRN_charity_for_needy_desc:0 "While griffons are generally not known for their generosity, it means being generous is regarded as exceptional and praiseworthy. By aiding the impoverished griffons in our nation who have suffered the consequences of Wingbardy's economic crisis, we can earn the respect of the common griffon and help them get back on their paws."
 FRN_found_airforce:0 "Found the Francistrian Airforce"
 FRN_found_airforce_desc:0 "Our neighbours in Wingbardy have had an airforce for years now, but we should establish one of our own. We should guard our own skies as well as aid our allies. In the age of modern warfare, control of the airspace is increasingly vital and we should not rely on others to defend us from aerial attacks."
 FRN_army_motorization:0 "Army Motorization"
 FRN_army_motorization_desc:0 "The Wingbardian army began to motorize many years ago, and now has entire battalions of mobile infantry that utilize modern vehicles for rapid deployment, moving even faster than flying griffons. We should follow their example and begin the motorization of our own army. For this, we need a sizeable supply of trucks and other vehicles."
 FRN_equipment_modernization:0 "Equipment Modernization"
 FRN_equipment_modernization_desc:0 "Much of our equipment is outdated, with some of the soldiers even having the same rifles that were used during the Falcor War. After Count Francis VIII's passing, little was done to keep up with the development of weapons, but now is time to take action and replace our old equipment. Wingbardian arms companies will aid us in our effort."
 FRN_knightly_traditions:0 "Knightly Traditions"
 FRN_knightly_traditions_desc:0 "Even before the conquests of Francis I, the land that would later become Francistria was famed for its pious and righteous knights. This tradition survives to this day, and our knights are proud of their skills. However, these traditions are of little use in the modern battlefield unless some changes are made and our knights are retrained."
 FRN_creeping_barrage:0 "Modern Creeping Barrage"
 FRN_creeping_barrage_desc:0 "The creeping barrage was first used in the final years of the Falcor war, with concentrated artillery bombardments preceding the advance of the infantry, who could break through battered defences with relative ease. While nowadays barrages see less use, they still have potential. Adopting our old tactics for the modern age will allow us to apply them."
 FRN_build_airport:0 "Build The Francistria City Airport"
 FRN_build_airport_desc:0 "As air travel becomes more commonplace and the importance of aerial warfare grows, we need a proper base for our civilian and military planes. For this reason, we will construct a new and large airport near the capital, which will also serve as a vital refueling point for planes travelling between Aquileia and Wingbardy."
 FRN_crackdown_on_mafia:0 "Crackdown On Wingbardian Mafia"
 FRN_crackdown_on_mafia_desc:0 "Following the economic crisis in Wingbardy, their mafias greatly expanded their operations, even across the borders of the nation. Many impoverished griffons joined their ranks out of desperation and now take part in their crimes. It is time we intervene and order our police to execute a nation-wide crackdown on these criminal gangs!"
 FRN_free_education:0 "Free Education"
 FRN_free_education_desc:0 "it is the duty of the modern nation to maintain public schools and ensure every citizen attains basic literacy. Unless we want to lag behind in the past, we need to make basic education available for every griffon, regardless of age or background. It will be costly, but it will pay itself back over the coming years."
 FRN_engineering_school:0 "Open The School of Engineering"
 FRN_engineering_school_desc:0 "Engineering is the foundational skill of modern, industrialised societies. However, our country is lacking in skilled engineers, even after the recent influx of Wingbardian intelligentsia. We need to invest in educating a new generation of engineers who are eager and ready to face the challenges of industrialising our backwards nation."
 FRN_science_patronage:0 "Science Patronage"
 FRN_science_patronage_desc:0 "Promising innovators shall have the support of the government, so they can focus on their studies instead of being distracted by salaried work. Many scholars have left Wingbardy in recent years, frustrated at being neglected. We will treat them much better and provide them a good home in our nation. In return, they will share their breakthroughs with us."
 FRN_electromechanical_award:0 "Electromechanical Engineering Award"
 FRN_electromechanical_award_desc:0 "[Root.GetLeader] has made a public announcement that they will offer a generous award to any griffon that manages to make a scientific breakthrough in the field of electromechanical engineering. This has inspired many engineers to get to work and try to come up with an invention that would be truly revolutionary. No matter who succeeds, we will benefit."
 FRN_francistrian_academy:0 "The Francistrian Academy of Sciences"
 FRN_francistrian_academy_desc:0 "It is time we merge various scholarly societies into a single fraternity, centralized in a single location: The academy of sciences. It will be a prestigious institution indeed, and the future home for our brightest minds. By working together, they will be able to make breakthroughs that were previously unimaginable."
 FRN_mechanise_mines:0 "Mechanize Goldenfeather Mines"
 FRN_mechanise_mines_desc:0 "The mines in the hills of Goldenfeather are a vital source of iron ore and chromite, but their equipment is badly outdated. We should invest in mechanizing the mining operations by purchasing drills, pumps, elevators and more from neighbouring countries. This will allow the mining companies to greatly increase production."
 FRN_francistrian_wine:0 "Promote Francistrian Wine"
 FRN_francistrian_wine_desc:0 "Long has everyone considered Vinovian wine to be superior to ours, to the point where the unique flavour of our own beverage is not well known. To support our farmers, we will start a government-funded campaign to advertise our wine abroad, reminding griffons that they do not have to drink stale Vinovian wine when they could instead try out something new."
 FRN_railroad_expansion:0 "Railroad Expansion"
 FRN_railroad_expansion_desc:0 "Currently, railways only connect major towns in Francistria, with many settlements remaining stranded from the capital, their traders forced to use rivers or dirt roads for travel. We must invest into our railway network to connect many more towns, to renovate old tracks and to purchase new and faster trains."
 FRN_tractor_factories:0 "A New Tractor Factory"
 FRN_tractor_factories_desc:0 "While our agricultural production is considerable, much of the work still done by claw. We could ease the workload on our peasants and greatly increase production by manufacturing affordable tractors. Therefore we should open a large, state-owned factory dedicated to just that."
 FRN_industrial_development_policy:0 "An Industrial Investment Policy"
 FRN_industrial_development_policy_desc:0 "We have been planning a major push for industrialising our nation, opening many new factories and encouraging further urbanisation. This will be a great leap forward for our underdeveloped country. But before our plans can be executed, we will need to decide what region we will focus on developing."
 FRN_mechanized_agriculture:0 "Mechanized Agriculture"
 FRN_mechanized_agriculture_desc:0 "With our tractor factory producing an ample supply of modern equipment for our farms, it's time to put them to good use. With increased crop yields, we can not only export more but also secure our own food supply, ensuring that bread remains widely available for all griffons in our nation."
 
 ### Ideas
 FRN_noble_council:0 "The Regnant Arengo"
 FRN_noble_council_desc:0 "After Count Francis I founded the realm of Francistria, he allowed local rulers to maintain their titles as long as they became his vassals. Count Francis II, fearing to be overthrown, further pleased the nobles by forming an advisory council, the Arengo, where the three highest-ranking nobles could influence decision-making and represent the aristocracy. Most of the power remained in the claws of the Count.\n\nAfter Tarrin was liberated from the Aquileians, another seat was added to the council. Francis VIII granted the title of Governor-General to his trusted second-in-command Vittorio, making him the "representative" of Tarrin.\n\nThe influence of the Arengo remained limited over the years. After Count Francis VIII's death, they took the opportunity and practically seized power, treating Count Francis IX as little more than a fifth member of the Arengo. However, the nobles often end up in deadlocks with two on each side, and thus need the Count to function as a tie-breaker. That is what little authority he has, unless he manages to sway some of the nobles to his side."
 FRN_wingbardian_dependance:0 "Dependence on Wingbardy"
 FRN_wingbardian_dependance_desc:0 "For centuries now, Francistria has firmly been in Wingbardy's sphere of influence. While the proud Counts of the past zealously preserved Francistrian sovereignty, they also sought to maintain close relations with Wingbardy. As Francistria primarily focused on exporting minerals and food to Wingbardy, its own economy remained underdeveloped even as Wingbardy itself industrialised. The Counts always had Wingbardian advisors by their side and listened to them closely.\n\nWith the unfortunate death of Count Francis VIII and the weak rule of Francis IX, this has only become worse. Wingbardian companies exploit the Francistrian economy and the army relies on Wingbardians to train officers and provide supplies. If nothing is done, Francistria's sovereignty will erode, until it ceases to exist."
 FRN_fascists_0:0 "§WPatriotic League:§! §GCalm§!"
 FRN_fascists_0_desc:0 "Lega Patriottica di Fransistria, usually simply known as the LPF, is a far-right nationalist party comprised primarily of veterans of the Falcor War. The league is divided into Francistrian nationalists and Wingbardian nationalists, with the latter wanting the country to unite with its "homeland". Despite these differences, members of the league cooperate well. They respect the rule of the Count, but advocate for policies that are in line with their ideology, and might intervene if they grow displeased with his rule.\n\nAt the present, LPF is for the most part content with the government and its policies. While they continue to publish propaganda, none of it is against the Count. We should still keep an eye on them nonetheless."
 FRN_fascists_1:0 "§WPatriotic League:§! §gSuspicious§!"
 FRN_fascists_1_desc:0 "Lega Patriottica di Fransistria, usually simply known as the LPF, is a far-right nationalist party comprised primarily of veterans of the Falcor War. The league is divided into Francistrian nationalists and Wingbardian nationalists, with the latter wanting the country to unite with its "homeland". Despite these differences, members of the league cooperate well. They respect the rule of the Count, but advocate for policies that are in line with their ideology, and might intervene if they grow displeased with his rule.\n\nAt the present, LPF has grown suspicious of the Count and his decisions, disagreeing with some of them. However, for the most part they are content with the situation in the country."
 FRN_fascists_2:0 "§WPatriotic League:§! §YOffended§!"
 FRN_fascists_2_desc:0 "Lega Patriottica di Fransistria, usually simply known as the LPF, is a far-right nationalist party comprised primarily of veterans of the Falcor War. The league is divided into Francistrian nationalists and Wingbardian nationalists, with the latter wanting the country to unite with its "homeland". Despite these differences, members of the league cooperate well. They respect the rule of the Count, but advocate for policies that are in line with their ideology, and might intervene if they grow displeased with his rule.\n\nAt the present, LPF has publicly condemned some of the Count's recent actions and demanding him to revert them. Their attitude towards us has changed for the worse, though they refrain from violence for now."

 FRN_fascists_3_desc:0 "Lega Patriottica di Fransistria, usually simply known as the LPF, is a far-right nationalist party comprised primarily of veterans of the Falcor War.

In his opinion, force is what forms nations and keeps them together, and Francistria is a shining example of this. He is known to be a LPF sympathiser, despite being a Francistrian nationalist first and Wingbardian second. In his eyes, Tarrinians are Francistrians too, they just won't admit it unless some sense is knocked into them."

The House of Felice has risen to the ranks of the nobility, and Vittorio will forever be grateful."
 FRN_bianca:0 "Lady Bianca Bentivoglio"
 FRN_bianca_desc:0 "Ruler of the small but prospering Ladyship of Eatela, Bianca Bentivoglio sees herself as the benevolent overlady of her subjects. She is soft-spoken, but has a sharp mind and a strong business sense. She is the head of several Eatelan companies which are at the forefront of Francistrian industrialisation, but is forced to compete with Wingbardian ones who have an advantage in the market. Out of all the nobles of Francistria, she is the only one who doesn't make fun of Count Francis IX."
 FRN_dante:0 "Baron Dante Covello"
 FRN_dante_desc:0 "The young and infamous Baron of Roameo holds the finest banquets and parties in the County, but his subjects are impoverished and his lands are a wooded backwater. He is charismatic and well-spoken, but he is selfish and a talented liar. He is a griffon of contrasts, and is thusly both adored and despised."
 FRN_ippolita:0 "Viscountess Ippolita La Ciliegia"
 FRN_ippolita_desc:0 "Ippolita La Ciliegia was once the wife of Francis VIII, before he tragically perished in the Falcor War. She has been a widow ever since and has refused to marry. She bore no offspring for the Count and is rumoured to be infertile. The lands she rules over, however, are anything but infertile. The Viscounty of Goldenfeather is the breadbasket of the country and even exports food to Wingbardy, especially as the Prywhen Civil War prevents grain imports and eliminates competition. But focusing solely on agriculture has made her Viscounty underdeveloped, and the ever-increasing need for more food production is a strain on the local peasants."

While he wishes for the ultimate abolishment of monarchy, he sees the nobles and fascists as a larger threat and is willing to cooperate with the Count. He distrusts the Talonuel Dynasty and wishes the Wingbardian communists there prevail despite their persecution."
 FRN_some_martlewing:0 "Marco Martlewing"
 FRN_some_martlewing_desc:0 "Marco was Francis VIII's uncle. When the Count had been alive, he had often taken care of the logistics while Francis VIII took care of the fighting itself. He has a calm, calculating mind and a firm grasp on military theory. Indeed, he fully expected to succeed Francis VIII after his untimely death, but had no strong claim to the throne and the Arengo would rather have a weak Count that could function as their puppet. Despite being unable to become the ruler of Francistria, he still remains loyal to the current Count, doing anything he can to aid him.

 ### Country Leader & General descriptions
 FRN_coward_count_desc:0 "Giosé Debolino Martlewing, whose regnal name is Francis IX and who is commonly known as "Francis The Stammerer", is the most unusual Count of Francistria in its history. He was the third child of Francis VIII's younger brother, and the only legitimate heir when the previous Count perished unexpectedly in the Falcor War. No one ever expected him to hold any important position, so his parents had given him little attention. In fact, the only attention he ever received from others was abuse and mockery because of his stuttering, which made him withdrawn and shy.\n\nUnlike his predecessors, Francis is not a proud and loud warrior. He is quiet and prefers to spend time in his private chambers or in the woods near Martlewing Castle, undisturbed by servants and officials. As such, the nobility, fascists and the Tarrin resistance all see their chance to gain power at the expense of the weak and pathetic Count, who will never amount to anything."
 FRN_angry_bird_desc:0 "Gherita Zarfatti is a veteran of the Falcor War, leader of the fascist LPF, rumoured mistress of Beakolini and, last but not least, a journalist and an art critic with a refined taste. She is the rising star of Francistrian politics, closely cooperating with Beakolini at all times. Her ultimate dream is Risorgimento, unification of all Wingbardian-speaking lands under one nation. She considers Tarrin to be a Wingbardian-speaking land, despite most linguists claiming that Tarrinian is a dialect of Aquileian. As an expert propagandist, she is convincing more and more Francistrians to share her belief."
 FRN_bird_brienne_desc:0 "Some may call her a heretic, while others call her a defender of the poor and weak. Gina de Gioia is the Grandmaster of the Knights of the Trinity, whose primary duty is to protect members of their often persecuted religious sect, Trinitarianism. Her faith regards all three griffon deities as manifestations of a singular divine form, which is why practitioners of Trinitarianism do not have separate temples or priests for each deity. While the sect has members across the continent, a vast majority of them are in Francistria. Throughout the years, they served the Counts loyally and fought alongside them in battle, which was often the only thing keeping them safe from the Archonates that regard them as vile heretics. The Count protects them, and in turn they protect Trinitarianists. Gina de Gioia herself is pious and kind-hearted, yet a fearsome combatant in battle. She is known for her height, which has earned her the nickname "Gina the Tall"."
 FRN_peasant_from_monty_python:0 "A fat griffon in his fifties, Giacomo Dalleotti looks like an average aging peasant. But he is first and foremost a politician, a veteran of the agrarian socialist PSA. His values are a strange mix of conservatism and communism, advocating both the end of nobility and the preservation of traditional Francistrian culture. While he wishes for the ultimate abolishment of monarchy, he sees the nobles and fascists as a larger threat and is willing to cooperate with the Count. He distrusts the Talonuel Dynasty and wishes the Wingbardian communists there prevail despite their persecution."
 FRN_cutebird_desc:0 "Arturo Azzurino, commonly known as "The Bloodhound of Soarleto", is a young but capable general who rapidly rose through the ranks after the Falcor War. In that conflict he was little more than a sergeant, but became known for his bold (if harsh) leadership and atrocities committed against the Falcorians. His brutality impressed Vittorio Felice so much that he personally promoted and awarded him for his service. However, in the years since Arturo has grown distant from Vittorio due to his support of the fascists. He is fiercely loyal to the Count and would never think of betraying him, no matter what he does."
 
 ### Events
 francistria.1.t:0 "The Arengo Convenes"
 francistria.1.d:0 "It remains unclear how Francistria itself will be affected by Wingbardy's crisis. Some fear that Wingbardy will radicalize, while others think a new golden age will await as long as Francistrians trust in their Wingbardian friends. There are many different opinions and debates among the country's nobility, so to come to an agreement the most influential nobles have agreed to meet at Francistria. The young Count is invited as well, though he is not expected to influence the decision making much.\n\nThe Martlewing Castle, standing upon a hill next to the city of Francistria proper, soon received some prestigious visitors: Lady Bianca of Eatela, whose ladyship was small but prosperous, Baron Dante of Roameo, known for his parties and charms but also for the poverty of his forested lands, Viscountess Ippolita of Goldenfeather, ruler of the breadbasket of the country, and last but not least, Governor-General Vittorio Felice of Tarrin, responsible for administering the newly gained realm. Francis came to meet them, though was too shy to say a word.\n\nAfter a formal dinner, the five gathered in a chamber to discuss what Francistria should do with Wingbardy. The Governor-General and the Viscountess both advocated maintaining close relations to the southern ally, while the Lady of Eatela said Francistria had relied on Wingbardy too long and should seek to reduce excessive Wingbardian influence. The Baron had fallen asleep, but when he woke up, said "What have those accursed Wingbardians ever done for us? Where was the King when Falcor burned down Roameo? They call us allies but treat us like a chained hound."\n\nThe nobles' council erupted into shouting and arguing, with the Governor-General and Viscountess accusing the others of endangering their vital relations, while the opponents said the two personally benefited from Wingbardy and disregarded its negative influence on Francistria. Count Francis remained quiet and even considered hiding under the table. But then the Arengo went silent and turned to look at him. They were at a deadlock, with two on each side. Francis could cast the deciding vote and resolve the situation. And so, he awkwardly stuttered:"

 francistria.2.t:0 "Fascist March In Francistria City"
 francistria.2.d:0 "In support of Beakolini's march on Karthin, the paramilitary fascist organization LPF prepared its own, smaller-scale march in the center of Francistria City. Unlike Beakolini's PNF however, they did not plan to seize power in the nation. The march was organized to show solidarity to brothers and sisters in Wingbardy, and to display the ever-increasing power and influence of LPF.\n\nUnlike in Karthin, there was no opposition to their march when it began, or at any point during it. At most, only a several citizens threw some insults at the fascists, but most dared not anger them. The blackwings marched in orderly columns like a military battalion, lead by the infamous army officer Gherita Zarfatti. She had long been the leader of LPF and was rumoured to be Beakolini's mistress. Following her, the columns reached Martlewing Castle, and began to sing Giovinezza, a song favoured by Beakolini's fascists. Francis stayed inside and did not dare to go outside before they eventually left.\n\nIt seems there is nothing in the way of the fascists, so they can freely continue to pompously posture and attract new members."
 francistria.2.a:0 "Worrying..."
 
 francistria.3.t:0 "The Count's Burden"
 francistria.3.d:0 "The Count sat in his office, shuffling documents. Before, the Martlewings had always been absolute monarchs, but Francis IX usually delegated tasks to nobles. This time was an exception. Reforms regarding Francistria's relationship with Wingbardy felt too important. Talonuels had always been friends of Martlewings. It would simply add insult to injury if a Martlewing didn't oversee the changes himself. However, he had little knowledge of policy-making and diplomacy. He even barely knew how to read and write, having taught himself to do both as a child.\n\nThere was a knock on the door and Francis snapped out of his thoughts. The Lady and Baron had wanted to meet him and discuss about Wingbardy with him. Hesitantly, he got up and opened the door. The two nobles greeted him, happy that he had supported them in the council, but Francis remained stoic and silent. They all sat down.\n\n"S-so, um, what d-did you have in m-mind?" Francis asked with his stutter.\nThe Baron shrugged. "Nothing, personally. I honestly do not care for the entire matter. I was merely returning a favour to Lady Bianca in the council," he said and winked at her with a coy smile.\nShe rolled her eyes and presented a thick stack of papers. "I have an entire program for curtailing Wingbardian influence. You can trust me with this task."\n\n"A-actually," Francis said quietly, "I don't think I can let others handle this. I-it's too im-important. I have to-to do something m-myself for once."\n\nThe Baron lifted an eyebrow. The Lady sighed and clasped the Count's claw. "Poor Francis. Listen, don't pressure yourself into doing anything. I know how difficult this is for you. You were never supposed to be burdened so greatly."\n"Sor-ry, but I have t-to. I hope t-t-this doesn't offend you."\nShe shook her head. "No no, it's fine. But at the very least take advice from us. And do find someone capable to help you. You can't do this yourself, Francis dear."\nHe nodded slowly and even made brief eye contact with her."
 francistria.3.a:0 "She is right."
 
 francistria.4.t:0 "An Unlikely Ally"
 francistria.4.d:0 "The leader of PSA, Giacomo Dalleotti, wandered in the entrance hall of Martlewing Castle, his beak open in awe and eyes wide open. "Mamma mia, such a fancy abode for a mere clawful of griffons!" he exclaimed.\n\n"P-please, keep it q-quiet," Count Francis asked, standing next to him. "This meet-ting is supposed to be sec-cret."\n"Apologies, mister Francis. I am simply amazed by the luxury your family has. I lived my entire life in a mud hovel, eating grandma's pasta every day! Meanwhile I am sure you enjoy a different species of fish every day."\n"N-no, I don't e-eat much. A-anyways, I have some q-questions for you, first of-of all."\n"Go ahead, then. I am very curious to know why a Count wishes to talk to a lowly peasant like me."\n"You and your p-party oppose W-Wingbardian influence, right?"\n"Yes," he said and nodded.\n"You also have the b-best interest of the p-people in mind?"\n"Yes of course," he said and nodded.\n"And you want to d-do something about those b-blackwing... blackwing thugs?"\n"Yes, yes!" he said and nodded quickly. "Why are you asking all this?"\n"Y-you are perfect then. I-I am asking for y-your help."\nHis eyebrows rose. "My help? Of me and PSA? Oh, such a privilege! Francis VIII would've loved to behead us all personally. You are not at all like him!" He grabbed Francis' claw and shook it enthusiastically. "Mister Francis, from now on you are considered our comrade!"\nFrancis smiled ever so slightly. Behind him in the shadows, an eavesdropping servant turned to leave. She had heard enough. Zarfatti will be furious when she reveals this meeting to her."
 francistria.4.a:0 "Well this was unexpected."
 
 francistria.5.t:0 "A Scandalous Ally"
 francistria.5.d:0 "On the following day, the frontpage of Campi di Taloncana contained the news about Count Francis personally endorsing the communist PSA party, and rumours began to form of the cause of the strange act. Fascists of LPF were, unsurprisingly, outraged and claimed the leader of PSA Giacomo Dalleotti had somehow extorted or threatened the Count for political favours. Once Lady Bianca of Eatela heard of this, she immediately took a train to Francistria City to meet with the Count.\n\n"If I may ask, what were you thinking?" Bianca asked. Francis was sitting behind his desk, absentmindedly shuffling papers so he had an excuse to avoid eye contact.\n"Y-you told me I should g-get help. And s-so I did."\n"But why some dirty communist peasants? I'm not angry, I just want to understand. It's... strange."\nFrancis let out a deep sigh. "They are l-like me, the p-peasants. Always op-pressed and bullied and t-told they can do n-nothing. But unlike m-me, these socialists st-truggle to make the world a b-better and more eq-qual place, free of oppression and f-fear. It's b-better to ask, why wouldn't I ask t-their help?"\n\nBianca nodded, now realizing his motivation. "I... see. If you put it that way, I can understand why you did it. But it was still a rather silly thing to do, as the fascists and nobles are upset."\n"To Tartarus with them," Francis muttered, without stuttering. "Bunch of bullies. I don't care for them."\nBianca raised an eyebrow. "Not even me? I'm a noble, after all."\nWith a faint smile, Francis glanced at her eyes. "With you, I sup-pose I c-can make an excep-ption.""
 francistria.5.a:0 "Let's hope this all turns out well."
 
 francistria.6.t:0 "Francistria Nationalizes Wingbardian Companies"
 francistria.6.d:0 "Bothersome news from Francistria: Count Francis has made the controversial decision to nationalize Wingbardian businesses and their assets. He stated that the reason for doing so was the excessive influence they had over their economy, and how it drained funds away from their country. It is rumoured that the local socialists of the PSA encouraged the Count to do this act. Knowing his meek character, he only did this because he was coerced to do so.\n\nSeveral of our companies have now lost a substantial amount of wealth and property, including our mining companies which can no longer operate on Francistrian soil. However, the Count has personally compensated them for their losses out of his own pocket. Whether we like it or not, Francistrians are now much less dependent on the Wingbardian economy than they used to be."
 francistria.6.a:0 "An interesting development."
 
 francistria.7.t:0 "Tarrin Socialists Express Support"
 francistria.7.d:0 "An unexpected message has been delivered to Count Francis from the Tarrin Liberation Front. While the police suspected the letter to contain a bomb, it proved to be completely innocuous and was presented to the Count. In the message, the socialists of the resistance movement commended Francis for choosing to cooperate with their comrades in the PSA and for boldly refusing to back down even after protests from the fascists of LPF. They wished he would listen to the advice of Giacomo Dalleotti in regards to the rights of peasants and workers. As a further sign of cordiality, the socialists promised to not commit any acts of terrorism for an entire week."

 francistria.8.t:0 "Tarrinians Celebrate Nationalization"
 francistria.8.d:0 "It seems the resistance fighters of FLNT are happy to hear that Wingbardian assets have been nationalized. Several Wingbardian companies have been accused of seizing land and property from locals in Tarrin and treating their workers poorly. Especially the activities of Wingbardian oil companies in Transista have been questionable at best.\n\nHowever, the Tarrinians now worry what the County will do with everything it has seized, and how the now state-owned companies will treat Tarrinian workers. They are more than willing to go back preparing bombs and ambushes if the Francistrian government proves to be no better than the Wingbardian capitalists."

 francistria.9.d:0 "A military patrol in the city of Tarrin was attacked by terrorists of the Front de Libération Nationale de Tarrin on midday. The soldiers were marching in a loose column when a nearby civilian truck suddenly exploded, killing two of them in an instant as well several bystanders. Before the soldiers could recover, a group of masked militants attacked from several directions, wielding rifles and shouting "Vive la Tarrin!". In the ensuing firefight many more soldiers lost their lives or suffered wounds before reinforcements arrived and drove back the terrorists. In the end, our casualties consisted of nine soldiers, dead or wounded, while the terrorists lost four. In addition five civilians were caught in the crossfire. One FLNT fighter was taken prisoner but managed to commit suicide with a hidden knife before she could be interrogated."

 francistria.10.t:0 "In The Shadow Of A Giant"
 francistria.10.d_lady:0 "It was late evening and Count Francis was headed to a yet another meeting with the nobles. He had taken the long route in a vain attempt to delay the session, his pawsteps echoing in the empty halls of the Martlewing Castle. He stopped near a large marble statue of his predecessor, Francis VIII, and examined it closely.\n\nIt depicted him as a larger than life figure, a stern, scarred veteran who did not fear death or Maar himself. He had a uniform adorned with countless medals, with a ceremonial sword in his claws. This griffon had boldly seized Tarrin from Aquileia and fought on the frontlines during the fateful Falcor War.\n\nCount Francis IX felt very tiny compared to the imposing statue. He in fact felt pathetic. How could he ever hope to even come close to such a mighty griffon? And why should he even try? He had never been prepared for this. Being a ruler is such a headache. It is a position that should only be held by the strong and determined.\n\nHe snapped out of his thoughts as he noticed another griffon entering the hallway. It was Lady Bianca of Eatela.\n"Oh, there you are, Count. I was wondering what was taking you so long. Baron Dante is getting very impatient."\nFrancis looked at the floor. "S-sorry ma'am, I just g-got distrac-cted. I w-will be there s-shortly"\nBianca glanced at the statue. "Ah yes, Francis VIII. I remember him well. This statue might depict him as a mighty warrior, but in reality he was an angry, bitter griffon. His relationship with his wife, Ippolita, was very rocky. That's why he never had children, and that's why you inherited."\nFrancis looked up. "R-really? I d-didn't know that."\nBianca turned back to him and placed a claw on his shoulder. "Giosé, if I may use your birth name, I know this is a burden to bear. But don't make it worse by deluding yourself that you need to be as "great" as other Martlewing Counts. In the end, they were all flawed in their own way.""

He stopped near a large marble statue of his predecessor, Francis VIII, and examined it closely.\n\nIt depicted him as a larger than life figure, a stern, scarred veteran who did not fear death or Maar himself. He had a uniform adorned with countless medals, with a ceremonial sword in his claws. This griffon had boldly seized Tarrin from Aquileia and fought on the frontlines during the fateful Falcor War.\n\nCount Francis IX felt very tiny compared to the imposing statue. He in fact felt pathetic. How could he ever hope to even come close to such a mighty griffon? And why should he even try? He had never been prepared for this. Being a ruler is such a headache. It is a position that should only be held by the strong and determined.\n\nHe snapped out of his thoughts as he noticed another griffon entering the hallway. It was Viscountess Ippolita of Goldenfeather.\n"Finally I found you, Count! I came looking for you because you are late for the meeting. Once again."\nFrancis looked at the floor. "S-sorry ma'am, I just g-got distrac-cted. I w-will be there s-shortly"\nIppolita looked at the statue wistfully. "My dear husband. I commissioned this statue after his... passing in the Falcor War. Often I think what it would've been like if he hadn't perished. Perhaps we would've had a child, who could've become a truly great Count. Unlike you."\nFrancis shuffled uncomfortably. "I-I am sorry. I d-didn't want this either."\nIppolita turned back to him, a tear flowing down her feathery cheek. "None of us did. But the Gods had other plans, and we must... learn to adapt. But no matter how hard you try, you will never come close to the greatness of my Francy. So don't even bother. Now come, the others are waiting."\nFrancis sighed and followed obediently."

 francistria.11.d:0 "Despite the cool relations Francis had with the military, he had no choice but to meet with officers in person if he wanted to have any influence on his nation's army doctrine. Therefore he summoned the commanding generals to Martlewing Castle to discuss the matter.\n\nWhen Governor-General Vittorio Felice arrived, he greeted the Count in a professional manner. His subordinate and the figurehead of LPF, Gherita Zarfatti, skipped the greeting entirely. Arturo Azzurino saluted him like a loyal soldier and the Grandmaster of the Knights of the Trinity Gina de Gioia bowed deeply in respect. All of them then gathered around a table and turned to look at Count Francis, who nervously took a deep breath.\n\n"A-as you know, I-I am determ-mined t-to not c-continue my p-predecessor's-"\n"Excuse me, your Grace," Arturo said, "But could you speak a little clearer? I'm struggling to understand what you're saying."\nGherita chuckled while Vittorio and the Grandmaster gave judgemental looks to the general. Francis seemed to shrink in size but managed to keep himself together. "I-I'll try my b-best to be clear, general. As I w-was saying, from now on the Fr-rancistrian military will be f-focused on defending its b-borders. It is up to y-you to decide how exactly our n-nation will be defended."\n\nWhile Gherita seemed to completely disagree with the entire decision and left the room in protest, the other officers remained and began to discuss. Vittorio Felice proclaimed that an aggressive defence would be ideal, with the use of overwhelming firepower and decisive counter-offensives. The Grandmaster argued that patience was key, and having extensive plans for every possible scenario would make sure they'd be ready to oppose any kind of attack on their nation. Arturo Azzurino seemed to be indifferent on the matter.\n\nThe Governor-General and the Grandmaster could not come to an agreement, and ultimately it was once again up to the Count to have the final say."

The Count of Francistria, Francis IX, had arrived for a diplomatic meeting with the King, escorted by his court and the Knights of the Trinity who functioned as his bodyguards. His Majesty Garibald Talonuel was waiting for him at the station and welcomed him to the capital in a lavish ceremony. The Count hesitantly shook the King's claw and soon enough the two were travelling to the King's palace by car.\n\nAfter various other ceremonies and formalities, the two monarchs were finally in the King's personal chambers. Garibald clasped his claws, his formal and gentle look being replaced by a more stern one.\n"Count Francis, the news from your country which have come to my attention make me concerned. Dismissing our advisors, nationalizing our assets and so forth. At least you had the decency to meet me and discuss this serious matter in person."\nThe Count gulped nervously. He hadn't met the King before, and wasn't sure what to expect. He breathed in and began to cautiously speak. "Your majesty. It was n-never my intent... to insult Wingbardy or its griffons. As you may know. The influence of your c-companies and advisors simply grew too great, becoming d-detrimental... detrimental to our own development. I strongly believe. That Franc-Franc-Franc— E-excuse me, sir..."\nGaribald's expression softened. "It is fine. I understand. Count Francis, the houses of Talonuel and Martlewing have always been friends. I do not intend for this to change. But I also see that your nation has grown far too reliant on our aid."\nFrancis nodded, happy that he understood him and that he didn't have to explain himself more.\n"However, I must admit I am offended and disappointed of how your government has resolved the matter. If you had acted with more deliberation, discussing the problem with us, then perhaps we could've figured out a solution together. Alas, you dealt with it yourself, damaging our relations and the prestige of Wingbardy."\nFrancis hung his head low in shame. "S-sorry, your ma-majesty. W-we will consult you in the f-future."\nGaribald smiled. "Apology accepted. I must say, you are not at all like the previous Count. Now come, let us enjoy dinner and celebrate our friendship.""

We are proposing two options: Either further develop the capital, making it rival the great Wingbardian cities, or invest into every region equally. Both have their advantages and disadvantages, and it is up to you, esteemed griffons, to decide."\n\nAs soon as he stopped speaking, a furious debate began. Lady Bianca of Eatela argued in favour of developing the capital and its surrounding, saying it would be more economically viable. Viscountess Ippolita of Goldenfeather countered her, saying she just wanted Eatela to benefit for it was near the capital, and said that Francistria was developed enough. Other regions, including her own domain, needed investments to boost their poorer economies. Governor-General Vittorio reminded that "putting all eggs in one basket" was strategically foolish, while Baron Dante surprisingly didn't care for the development of his own region, saying putting any money into backwater provinces was a waste, as their inhabitants were inherently poor and lazy.\n\nOnce again, the Arengo was at an impasse, and Count Francis had to speak up and voice his own opinion so the argument would come to an end."

He struggled to even look himself in the mirror. Nevertheless, he cleared his throat, and begun to speak words he had memorized. "Y-your maj-majesty, I-it was n-never m-my..."\n\nHe mumbled a curse, frustrated by his uncontrollable stutter. How could the King of Wingbardy take him seriously if he spoke like that? He had perfectly memorized the lines yet spoke like a two-year-old chick.\n\nA knock on the door startled him. He had told his court to not bother him, but somegriff had defied that order. Shows what little authority he had. He still went and opened the door. However, it wasn't one of his courtiers or servants who was there, but Lady Bianca. Francis frowned, but didn't know what to say.\n\n"Hello, Francis. Sorry to interrupt. But uh, I heard you're going to meet King Garibald soon, and I wanted to help. I know talking is hard to you." She presented a book and offered it to Francis. "Here, a book about learning to manage stammer. It'd be best to get treated by a therapist, but I think you'd rather be left alone."\nFrancis took the book and examined it, then glanced at Bianca and smiled. "T-thank you, m'lady. I n-needed this."\nBianca smiled in return. "Well, I better get going then, I know you didn't want to be disturbed too much."\n\nFrancis returned to the front of the mirror, browsing the book and reading various pieces of advice. He should pace his phrases, take slight breaths in, replace fear and anxiety with other emotions. He looked up at the mirror again, took a deep breath, and remembered that he stuttered less when angry. So he thought of the LPF, and their pompous parades, and Gherita's nonsensical rambles. Then, slowly and deliberately, he spoke. "Your majesty. It was never my intent to insult Wingbardy and its griffons."\nHe looked himself in the mirror, and smiled proudly."

They refuse to be Francistrian" and "Tarrin does not have any culture or history". She did not seem to care for the outrage among Tarrinians that followed, and simply said "They'll accept the truth eventually."\n\nSeveral days after this, the locals in Tarrin seemed to calm down, and there even was a lull in terror attacks. Sara Cinelli went on leave and was going to leave Tarrin by car. Unfortunately, her car and her escorts were ambushed as they drove on the hillside roads. FLNT terrorists detonated a bomb in front of the convoy and attacked before the soldiers could recover. Soon after, they retreated, and Sara Cinelli was found mortally wounded. She died several hours later before a hospital could be reached.\n\nThe incident has now appeared on national news. LPF members are calling for harsher measures against the terrorists and demand [Root.GetLeader] to take immediate action.

Bianca thought he had only come to Eatela to take part in the celebrations. What was he now doing here? She entered, and Dante greeted her by grasping her claw and pecking it with his beak.\n"Always a pleasure to see you, Lady Bianca."\nShe pulled her claw away and forced a smile. "Good to see you, Dante. Why did you want to meet me in person?"\n"I wish to discuss the prospect of our marriage. You promised to me you would consider it."\nBianca's smile faded. Of course she had done that, but now... perhaps she had changed her mind. "I... I am not so sure any longer."\nDante raised an eyebrow. "How come? The alliance of our dynasties would be mutually beneficial and give us leverage over the other nobles.

Governor-General Vittorio, Viscountess Ippolita and General Gherita all arrived in time for the scheduled meeting, and were ready to depart shortly after its end.\n\n"I suppose we can all agree that the Count has become a puppet of the Lady, the Baron and the PSA," Gherita said. "They are using him to sever our ancient ties with Wingbardy and leave us stranded, left without reliable allies, surrounded by hungry wolves."\nVittorio adjusted his monocle. "I wouldn't go so far, but I can agree that some of the policies are... worrying. I have also noticed how they seem to please the Tarrinians, intentionally or not."\n"Who knows, maybe even the Tarrinians are cooperating with them. Either way, we must make preparations to stop them before it's too late."\n"I wouldn't say the Count is a mere puppet," the Viscountess said. "I used to think he was. But... he has changed in recent times. He almost reminds me of my late husband, in a way."\nGherita and Vittorio laughed. "That stammering coward is not comparable to Francis VIII in any way," Gherita said. "If he was still alive, he'd throw the Lady, the Baron and every single member of PSA into prison where they belong!"

Part of the program was organizing various state-funded cultural events, the most important of which was the Festival of Masks. It was once a traditional celebration held annually before being banned by Count Francis III for being "a foolish waste of time".\n\nNow the event is being held again after a very long hiatus. The event consisted of everygriff wearing masks to disguise their identity and wandering around the town to meet griffons and attempt to recognize them. No one was excluded from participating, so it often led to nobles and commoners intermingling. This, perhaps, had been one of the reasons Count Francis III had banned the event.\n\nNow, Count Francis IX was one of the participants, wearing a simple wooden mask on his face and ascetic woolen clothing. He walked around Francistria City, casually chatting with strangers. His stutter was barely noticeable and he held his head higher than usual. There were no expectations placed on him, and no one was judging his actions and behaviour.\n\nEventually, Francis met a lady griffon and engaged in a lengthy conversation with her. She was clearly an intelligent, savvy and kind griffoness. Not only that, but her voice sounded familiar as well.\n"Lady Bianca, I presume?" he said, guessing her identity.\nHer eyes widened and she laughed."Well, you'd be correct. How did you recognize me? You're not a commoner after all, are you?"\nFrancis smiled warmly. "No. I am a Count, in fact."\n"Really? It's you? I... I didn't recognize you at all. Where's your stutter gone?"\n"It's not. Fully g-gone. But this mask gives me confidence. It helps me. To speak."\nBianca embraced him, catching him by surprise. "I am so glad for you, Francis.

FLNT has denounced the reprisal, calling it excessive, and has demanded the Francistrian government to take action.

Companies have also expanded their entreprises, bringing in Francistrian workers.\n\nLocal Tarrinians are not particularly fond of the new arrivals. The garrison is often occupied preventing fights from breaking out between locals and settlers, especially in Tarrin city itself, which has a large Francistrian minority. FLNT itself participates in violence aimed towards the newcomers and encourages it.\n\nRecently tensions have been running high after a protest demanding greater representation of Tarrinians in local governance was dispersed by the garrison. In the night following the incident, FLNT commandos raided countless villages in the countryside, targeting Francistrian settlers. They gunned down entire families as they were sleeping. Tarrinian peasants joined them in the lynchings, killing and looting like savages. By the time the garrison forces arrived to stop the terrorists, the commandos had already dispersed, leaving the peasants to face the Francistrian soldiers on their own. Hundreds were arrested and many more shot as they fought back against them, wielding pitchforks and hunting rifles.\n\nAs the sun rose, many hundreds of civilians lied dead. In response, Governor-General Vittorio Felice has imposed strict curfew in all of Tarrin and has vowed to bring the murderers to justice.

He also said that secession may be a dangerous move if Wingbardy is enraged by it and they cannot find any other allies. Francistria cannot possibly survive alone, that much is certain.\n\nA debate began between the three council members, and Francis listened closely. His wife Bianca said Wingbardy could easily justify military action or an economic embargo if they were to end the alliance. Viscountess Ippolita agreed, but also said that eventually Wingbardy would once again demand their aid in war and perhaps another Francis would fall needlessly in battle for Wingbardy's cause. Governor-General Vittorio warned that without Wingbardy to defend them, Aquileia would likely try to dominate them, but did like the idea of saving Francistrian sovereignty from Wingbardian claws.\n\nFrancis thanked them for advice, asked them to be quiet and pondered deeply what they had said. Eventually, he finally decided what to do."
 francistria.26.a:0 ""We s-shall remain in the pact for now.""
 francistria.26.b:0 ""It is t-time for us to leave the pact.""
 
 francistria.27.t:0 "Francistria Leaves The Pact"
 francistria.27.d:0 "Shocking news arrived in Karthin today: Count Francis IX of Francistria has decided to leave the Karthinian Pact. While he wishes to maintain friendly relations between our nations, he said that Wingbardian influence continued to threaten their sovereignty.\n\n[WNG.GetLeader] has received the news with mixed feelings. On one claw, Francistria is a long-time ally and their wishes should be respected, but on the other, this will endanger Wingbardy's northern border and threaten the interests of Wingbardian companies. If Francistria allies with a hostile power, they will likely be our future enemies. Some members of government already speak of a military occupation of Francistria to keep it firmly in the Wingbardian sphere, but in the end it is up to [WNG.GetLeader] to decide."
 francistria.27.a:0 "Prepare the tanks!"
 francistria.27.b:0 "If that is what they want, so be it."
 
 francistria.28.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Wishes To Join [Root.GetFactionName]"
 francistria.28.d:0 "Recently [From.GetName] has left the Karthinian Pact, leaving them stranded and without allies. Now they have contacted our envoys and expressed their desire to form an alliance with us. Of course, they acknowledged that in the past our relations have not been... ideal, but ask us to put the past behind us. The griffon who seized Tarrin from us during the revolution was Francis VIII, and he is long dead. [From.GetLeader] is nothing like him, they say.\n\nWhile another ally could prove to be useful in these dire times, it could end up dragging us into conflicts we should not be participating in. Besides, can the [From.GetAdjective]s truly be trusted? At the very least, we should demand them to cede Tarrin back to us as a sign of goodwill."
 francistria.28.a:0 "We accept only if they return Tarrin to us."
 francistria.28.b:0 "Let us formally invite them, then!"
 francistria.28.c:0 "We have no interest in this."
 
 francistria.29.t:0 "Aquileia Demands Tarrin"
 francistria.29.d:0 "[JER.GetLeader] has received our message about a potential alliance, and has responded. They say that if we wish to ally them, we must cede Tarrin back to them first. Only then can they truly trust us and consider us a potential friend. Accepting this demand would anger the LPF, there is no doubt, and would mean all investments in the region have gone to waste, but it might be necessary if we wish to find a powerful ally to protect us."
 francistria.29.a:0 "A heavy price to pay, but worth it."
 francistria.29.b:0 "Nevermind then. [Root.GetNameDef] stands alone."
 
 francistria.30.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Returns Tarrin"
 francistria.30.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] has wisely decided to cede Tarrin back to us. The [From.GetAdjective] garrison is already vacating the region and locals are celebrating. With this act, the [From.GetAdjective]s have proven that they indeed can be trusted. Preparations are therefore now being made to form an alliance between our two nations."
 francistria.30.a:0 "Perhaps they're not so bad after all."
 
 francistria.31.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Refuses To Cede Tarrin"
 francistria.31.d:0 "After hearing our demand, [From.GetLeader] seems to have changed his mind about allying us. Tarrin remains in their claws, and therefore they have proven that they indeed are not worth our trust. We will have to take Tarrin from them by force, if we want it back. Without any allies, they are unlikely to provide any meaningful resistance."
 francistria.31.a:0 "They're just as bad as we thought."
 
 francistria.32.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Wishes To Ally Us"
 francistria.32.d:0 "Recently, the [From.GetName] was left stranded and without allies, no longer being a member of the traitorous Karthinian Pact. Now a [From.GetAdjective] diplomat has arrived, inquiring if we would be interested in accepting them into our alliance. Their country was a vassal of the Empire once like most nations on Griffonia, but they too ended up betraying us. Can they truly be trusted?\n\n[Root.GetLeader] has considered demanding them to become our direct vassals again to ensure their loyalty, as a mere alliance would not be binding enough. But the truth is that they are desperate and rather weak, and thus would be unlikely to rebel again. Of course, in the end we can just ignore their plea and eventually annex their treacherous nation by force."
 francistria.32.a:0 "They must swear an oath of fealty first."
 francistria.32.b:0 "We need allies in our reconquest campaign."
 francistria.32.c:0 "Their country will rejoin the Empire soon enough..."
 
 francistria.33.t:0 "The Empire Demands An Oath"
 francistria.33.d:0 "It seems [From.GetLeader] is rather hesitant to trust us, as we feared, and has now demanded that we swear an oath of fealty to the Emperor, if we wish to have the protection of the mighty Reichsarmee. Such is the price of a powerful friend: Our sovereignty and independence. Is it worth paying, or not? It is up to [Root.GetLeader] to decide."
 francistria.33.a:0 "It must be done, to redeem ourselves."
 francistria.33.b:0 "Never!"
 
 francistria.34.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Bends The Knee"
 francistria.34.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] has accepted our demand and travelled in person to [Root.Capital.GetName] to swear an oath of fealty to His Majesty Emperor Grover VI. The [From.GetAdjective] delegation was welcomed, but not warmly, as there was still distrust in the air. But the ceremony itself went smoothly, and [From.GetLeader] became a vassal lord of the Imperial Crown, just like his predecessor. Let us pray they remain loyal this time."
 francistria.34.a:0 "They have chosen wisely."
 
 francistria.35.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Refuses"
 francistria.35.d:0 "It seems the [From.GetAdjective] have no interest in redeeming themselves and wish to remain traitors. They have refused our demand to swear an oath of fealty to the Emperor, and thus remain independent - and completely alone, at least for now. Time will tell if they can survive long enough to oppose our reconquest."
 francistria.35.a:0 "Such fools."
 
 francistria.36.t:0 "The Count Speaks"
 francistria.36.d:0 "Francis took a deep breath, like someone preparing to leap off a cliff into water. He looked at the balcony door and could hear the chatter coming from outside. Thousands of griffons had gathered there, and a microphone stood waiting for him, ready to broadcast his words across the nation and further beyond, and to record it permanently.\n\n"Are you sure you're ready for this?" his wife Bianca asked, caressing his cheek with her claw.\nFrancis glanced at her and smiled. "With you by my side, I am ready for anything."\n\nThe Count stood up and walked outside, slowly but not hesitantly. As he appeared, the griffons below noticed him and began to cheer, hailing their elusive ruler. With so many pairs of eyes focusing on him, Francis felt his old anxieties in the back of his mind, but he focused on everything he had learned over the years. Then, he began to speak.\n\n"I send to all my citizens. Both at home and gathered here. This message. W-with... with the same depth of feeling for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold. And speak to you. Myself. For too long. Have I stayed hidden in sight. Not acting like a true ruler. And f-figurehead of the nation. But no more! From this day on, I want my subjects to know who is their Count. For ultimately it is I who steer. The ship of state. And guide it through the storms. Yet in the end, I am a mere mortal just like you. With my own flaws. And shortcomings. N-no longer do I feel the need to hide them."\n\n"Francistria has already faced. Serious internal threats. And I assure you that I have done my b-best. To deal with them all. I hope this convinces you to trust me. As your sole and absolute sovereign. Vested with the power of the Trinity and the Gods. I wish for nothing but peace and prosperity. For my s-subjects. This is why I ask you to entrust me with having all this power. I may not be perfect. But I have good intentions. And a dream for a bright future. I will do my best to make this dream. A r-r... reality."\n\nDespite breaking down at the end, the audience did not mind and erupted into enthused jubilation, chanting "Long live the Count!". Francis couldn't help but smile, and looked behind him at Bianca. She was crying tears of pride and joy."
 francistria.36.a:0 "Long live the Count!"
 
 francistria.37.t:0 "Strategic New Villages"
 francistria.37.d:0 "[FRN.GetLeader] has somewhat hesitantly ordered the implementation of the Villagization program. It consists of the establishment of several hundred fortified settlements in Tarrin and the forcibly transferring tens of thousands of villagers to live in them. This will segregate a substantial portion of the rural population from the FLNT, depriving them of supplies, recruits and information.\n\nThese fortified villages will be guarded by the local garrison, surrounded by barbed wire and sentry towers. They will also be positioned strategically so they could support one another and receive quick reinforcements if needed.\n\nWhile the program is predicted to be effective at curbing the resistance, it does displease the local population, making them more sympathetic to the rebels. However, this should not matter as long as they are prevented from providing any aid to FLNT."
 francistria.37.a:0 "A necessary deed."
 
 francistria.38.t:0 "The Count's Burden"
 francistria.38.d:0 "Following the meeting of the Arengo, Count Francis IX was once again taking a stroll in the woods near Martlewing Castle, calming his nerves in quiet solitude. Recent events had strained him, but the song of birds and the fluttering of leaves in the wind never failed to distract his mind from the issues of his life. A life which he had never wanted to live in the first place, forced into being the figurehead of an entire nation, attracting so much unwanted attention. All he wanted was to be left alone, yet he had a duty to fulfill. Sometimes he wondered what it would be like to have a different kind of duty entirely. Perhaps there was some job out there that he'd enjoy doing, that wouldn't require forced smiles, tough decisions and lengthy talks?\n\nHis train of thought was broken as an entourage of griffons suddenly appeared, calling for him. He let out an exasperated sigh and went forth to meet them. The group was led by Viscountess Ippolita and Governor-General Vittorio. The latter spoke up when he saw him. "Ah, there you are, my Count! We have a matter we wish to discuss with you, in private."\nFrancis said nothing, which was taken as a sign of approval. Ippolita motioned the entourage to leave, and soon it was just the three of them. "Count, we are thankful for your support in the Arengo," the griffoness said. "However, we need you to continue supporting us in the future. The Baron and the Lady are becoming insufferable, proposing nonsensical reforms."\nVittorio nodded. "They wish to bring ruin to Francistria and conspire against you. But with you on our side, we can oppose their reforms and ensure continued stability and prosperity for Francistria."\n"Can we have your word, Count?" Ippolita demanded to know. "Will you swear to stand by our side in the future?"\n\nFrancis felt a strong urge to leave and be alone again, but he had to answer. He had to continue being a pawn in the nobles' petty political games if he wished to remain alive. And so he had no choice but to hesitantly nod.\nVittorio grinned. "Good. May our cooperation be most fruitful. Long live Francistria!""
 francistria.38.a:0 "His life is a prison."
 
 francistria.39.t:0 "Meeting The Grandmaster"
 francistria.39.d:0 "Gina de Gioia, Grandmaster of the Order of the Trinity, hadn't been allowed inside the Martlewing Castle in many years, ever since Francis VIII's death. It had changed little over time, with the only notable difference being its owner, the Count. She had been invited to meet him in person, albeit she was not certain what the purpose was.\n\nShe entered Francis IX's office and bowed respectfully. "N-no need to b-bother with the... f-formalities," the Count said. "L-let's just get this done and o-over with quickly."\n\nGina had heard that the Count had stutter, but hadn't expected it to be this bad. Nevertheless, she nodded in understanding. "What do you require, my lord?"\nFrancis seemed bothered. "D-don't call me that, p-please. A-anyways, the Arengo r-requested me to ask for y-your aid. The e-economic crisis of the last few d-decades has caused w-widespread poverty among the g-griffons. Not j-just that, but Governor-General V-Vittorio wishes you to h-help him in military matters."\n"Your wish is my command my lo-- my dear Count. We are already dedicated to helping the destitute, but if we receive funding from you, we will expand our efforts. Not a single beak will go unfed in Francistria! And of course, I am more than glad to aid in the defence of our homeland."\n"G-good, good. I-it's settled then. You m-may leave now."\nThe Count still hadn't made eye contact with her and now turned around on his chair. Gina stood still for a moment, then spoke. "My dear Count, I can see you are not pleased with having a meeting. May I inquire, why did you not simply delegate this task to a servant?"\nFrancis was silent, but eventually responded, without turning around. "I am the C-Count. I d-do what I must. It's w-what Francis VIII w-would've done."\n"I knew Francis VIII, and I can see you are nothing like him. You don't have to be, my dear Count. You can be anything you wish to be."\nFrancis sighed deeply. "If only that w-were so. Please, l-leave now."\nGina saluted the Count, then left the room. Francis continued to sit, pondering on the Grandmaster's words."
 francistria.39.a:0 "Their help will be most useful."
 
 francistria.40.t:0 "Francistria Development Plan"
 francistria.40.d:0 "The Arengo assembled once again in Martlewing Castle, this time inviting three Wingbardian advisors to attend: Agostino Paolino, Ismaele Rossi and Virgilio Piccio. During the meeting they would draft a comprehensive plan for the future of Francistria, and how the current issues plaguing the nation could be resolved.\n\nThe meeting lasted many hours, during which many fiery arguments were had. Lady Bianca of Eatela kept demanding the influence of Wingbardian companies to be reduced, while Agostino Paolino claimed those companies invested into the local economy and allowed quick growth. Baron Dante on the other claw said Francistria's army was a mere shadow of its former self, but Virgilio Piccio rebuked him and said Wingbardy's superior army would take care of defending Francistria while cooperating with the local army. Count Francis was always there supporting the Wingbardians, and eventually Lady Bianca and Baron Dante gave up entirely, allowing the rest to do what they liked with the plan.\n\nFinally, a rought draft of a ten-year program was ready, which the advisors would refine into complete form. Wingbardy was strongly involved in it, but on paper the plan seemed effective. Wingbardian companies would employ more Francistrians and pay them higher wages, production methods and factory machines would be revised to match those used in Wingbardy, more Wingbardian officers would be integrated into the ranks of the army, and so on. Wingbardy, Wingbardy, Wingbardy.\n\nCount Francis wasn't sure what to think of it all. The way it was written, the plan seemed to treat Francistria as a backwards province of Wingbardy itself, instead of its own separate nation. But Viscountess Ippolita and Governor-General Vittorio seemed very pleased with it, rubbing their claws in glee. Perhaps in return they would agree to leave him be for a good while."
 francistria.40.a:0 "With Wingbardy's aid, we will become great!"
 
 francistria.41.t:0 "FLNT Condemns The Development Plan"
 francistria.41.d:0 "When the news of the development plan were revealed in public, most griffons were either indifferent or accepting. However, Tarrinians were anything but happy. The plan stated that Wingbardian companies would prioritize hiring Francistrians and said nothing of Tarrinians. It was made worse by the fact that several Wingbardian companies have been accused of seizing land and property from locals in Tarrin and treating their workers poorly. Especially the activities of Wingbardian oil companies in Transista have been questionable at best. Now it seemed they received an expanded mandate to treat the Tarrinians as they pleased. Not only that, but the plan would increase Wingbardian military presence in the nation as well, making the struggle of FLNT even harder.\n\nFLNT has publicly condemned the plan and has called for Tarrinians to do anything they can to oppose its implementation. Soon after riots broke out in Tarrin and Transista where Wingbardian businesses were looted and oil pipes damaged, requiring the army to be called in to restore order."
 francistria.41.a:0 "They'll learn to appreciate it."
 
 francistria.42.t:0 "Generals Leave For Francistria"
 francistria.42.d:0 "Our friends in Francistria have expressed a desire to further expand our already expansive military cooperation. Their army is outdated and is in need of our assistance. Therefore [WNG.GetLeader] has sent generals Garlo Geloso and Gabaldo Goddu to Francistria, along with other lower-ranking officers and representatives of arms companies. All this should hopefully prove to be beneficial to our northern friends.\n\nOf course, it's not like the Francistrians themselves have nothing to teach us. This cooperation will benefit us as well, giving us deeper insight into different doctrines used by our ally."
 francistria.42.a:0 "Together we are stronger!"
 
 francistria.43.t:0 "Wingbardian Meddling In Tarrin"
 francistria.43.d:0 "When the Wingbardian assistance arrived, they were quick to get to work to train our military and modernize our armaments industry. However, it seems LPF has managed to persuade some of the Wingbardians to assist them in the fight against FLNT. The southeners had useful knowledge about suppressing resistance from their experience of annexing the city of Falcor, and were happy to apply it in Tarrin as well.\n\nWhile this did result in several successful operations, the Tarrinian resistance is far better organized than the Falcorian one ever was, so they are already adapting to the Wingbardian strategies. It has also fueled their propaganda about Francistrians being Wingbardian puppets intent on erasing the local Aquileian-influenced culture, which has further incited ethnic tensions in the area. While the Wingbardian help is appreciated, they might have done more harm than good."
 francistria.43.a:0 "This is a disservice to us."
