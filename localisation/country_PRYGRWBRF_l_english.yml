GRW_red_knights_desc:0 "Whilst the knights are an institution of the old monarchy, there's no reason we cannot make our own knightly orders, loyal to our goals and aims, and the peoples of our socialist state. Such as force would be a boon to any army, and would heighten our military prestige."
GRW_artillery_effort:0 "Focus on Big Guns"
GRW_artillery_effort_desc:0 "We have spent time focusing on our smaller firearms. However, it is now time to focus on larger weapons, such as cannons and howitzers. Infantry weapons are fine and all, but artillery is a great boon to any and all forces we put into the field."

GRW_foreign_tools:0 "Import of Industrial Machines"
GRW_foreign_tools_desc:0 "We should take the time to make deals with our more advanced neighbors both on this continent and across the water, to improve upon our industrial capacity by importing more advanced tools that we can then integrate into our industry. Over-all, it will make us more effective in our production efforts."
GRW_excavation_of_march:0 "Develop the Marsh"
GRW_excavation_of_mach_desc:0 "The terrible marsh is, as the name implies, quite terrible.
