### Events ###
hippone_sekrit.1.t:0 "The Price Of War"
hippone_sekrit.1.d:0 "TODO - Flavour event about the Star Father's troops "nationalising" the assets of a few industrialists from Zapsa, this includes murdering them and their families for corrupting Equine spirituality by engaging in capitalism, make it sublte, basically unstated that they're going to be murdered"
hippone_sekrit.1.a:0 "Za'al-Maar must be fought in all its forms"

hippone_sekrit.2.t:0 "Body And Mind"
hippone_sekrit.2.d:0 "TODO - Flavour event about Hiram's followers eagerly distributing food and water supplies to their followers, this is as much of a propaganda action as it is humantarianism. It's also very practical. The person distributing the food is a particularly Charismatic Equine of Gold (Think Evangelical Revivalist Preacher) agrandizing the virtues of the Covenant ect"
hippone_sekrit.2.a:0 "Maybe the Star Father isn't so bad..."

hippone_sekrit.3.t:0 "A Safe Haven"
hippone_sekrit.3.d:0 "TODO - Flavour event about the Covenant's Equines of Bronze And Iron doing their jobs and helping out the uninitiated in rebuilding their homes. Much like the Famine event this is both a propaganda and a humantarian action meant to show to the people that the Covenant is not all that bad... Or at least create the perception of it. Preacher character from the previous event should make an apperance again "
hippone_sekrit.3.a:0 "At least we've got rooves over our head again"

hippone_sekrit.4.t:0 "A Field Of Temples"
hippone_sekrit.4.d:0 "TODO - Flavour event about generally helping out the sick and the hungry in massive field hospitals attended to by the Equines Of Gold (Who also include Doctors), aside from helping out the Preacher character from before also makes an apperance preaching the values of healthy eating, a good fitness plan ect as the body is a living temple to the Godhead"
hippone_sekrit.4.a:0 "Nutritional value charts? Those exist?"

hippone_sekrit.5.t:0 "The Auspicious Government"
hippone_sekrit.5.d:0 "TODO - Flavour event about Equines Of Gold basically being appointed by Hiram to various towns, cities, villages ect to rule over them, this is the beginnings of the Covenant's political system which basically boils down to a Chinese style despotic bureaucracy mixed with a caste system and Plato's Republic"
hippone_sekrit.5.a:0 "In time the system shall cement..."

hippone_sekrit.6.t:0 "The Death Of The Old Order"
hippone_sekrit.6.d:0 "TODO - Event about Monzano being executed in Colthage alongside the remnants of Zarishat's old regime, the Zarcaids and the Constitutionalists have long since managed to escape, but still the message is clear, Colthage has fallen"
hippone_sekrit.6.a:0 "The sins of the past redeemed..."

hippone_sekrit.7.t:0 "A Lion Declawed"
hippone_sekrit.7.d:0 "TODO - Event about Zannido 'Bandolier' Zidon being executed, no final words, no anything, he is simply executed alongside all of his followers with his body being left in an unmarked grave somewhere in the countryside."
hippone_sekrit.7.a:0 "One less vermin to deal with"

hippone_sekrit.8.t:0 "The Shining Light"
hippone_sekrit.8.d:0 "TODO - Event about Zarza being offered up as what amounts to a sacrifice by the other leaders of the United Republican Front... Unfortunately the people they are surrendering to are Equines of Silver who promptly just turn their guns on them and kill them all, making sure to leave no survivors"
hippone_sekrit.8.a:0 "Was a muzzleflash"

hippone_sekrit.9.t:0 "The Price Of Art"
hippone_sekrit.9.d:0 "TODO - Flavour event about Colthage being rebuilt in a weird artistic baroque style by POWs who are "redeeming" themselves through labour. Needless to say the Covenant are not exactly being magnanimous following their victory. Those who can't work are killed, and they're generally overseen by Equines Of Bronze and Iron and Equines Of Silver who are enforcing their orders"
hippone_sekrit.9.a:0 "The building blocks of a new dawn"

hippone_sekrit.10.t:0 "The Ascendancy"
hippone_sekrit.10.d:0 "TODO - Event about the Covenant finally stabilising their hold over the nation giving it complete dominion and control over the lands of former Colthage. The Ascendandy of Zebrakind is officially proclaimed much to Hiram and the rest of the Equines Of Golds' joy, and the horror of everyone else"
hippone_sekrit.10.a:0 "Za'al-Maar shall tremble in our wake..."

hippone_sekrit.11.t:0 "The Gift Of Charity"
hippone_sekrit.11.d:0 "TODO - Flavour event about Equines Of Silver and more paramilitary members of the Covenant's forces helping out villages rebuild ect, it's basically a PR campaign, preacher character from before should reappear here"
hippone_sekrit.11.a:0 "Bit by bit"

hippone_sekrit.12.t:0 "Our Grand Victory"
hippone_sekrit.12.d:0 "TODO - Event about the Covenant winning the Civil War... Congrats I guess"
hippone_sekrit.12.a:0 "The Godhead be praised!"
