### Focuses ###
HIE_CTH_a1:0 "The Stars Are Right"
HIE_CTH_a1_desc:0 "The age of strife has begun my brothers and sisters, the stars have aligned and the battle for the soul of equinity has begun. But the corrupting forces of the Avian are always at work, and will not let us ascend beyond this world so easily. So we must continue to fight until final victory is achieved."
HIE_CTH_a2:0 "An Indomitable Will"
HIE_CTH_a2_desc:0 "The enlightend are the vanguard of the new age, those who know the truth of the Avian scourge form the core of our efforts. Unfortunately, until we can uplift our fellow equines, we cannot fully trust them in our ranks. Our forces shall stay small and elite for now."
HIE_CTH_a3:0 "The Power Of The Equines Of Silver"
HIE_CTH_a3_desc:0 "The wise and powerful Equines of Silver are the warriors of our new society, they are learned students of the Star Father and know his words and universal law. It is their spiritual power that shall allow them our armies to purge the plagues that afflict our land."
HIE_CTH_a4:0 "Strike At The Heart Of Evil"
HIE_CTH_a4_desc:0 "How the mighty Colthage has fallen when entrusted to the heathen Zarishat, the Right Hoof of the Demiurge. Selfish and wicked, she let the Avians into our homes for her own power and wealth, abandoning the great spirit of equinity and becoming one with the will of Za'al-Maar. But her general, Monzano still remains, carrying on her corrupting work. She must be purged."
HIE_CTH_a5:0 "March Upon The Crypto-Avians"
HIE_CTH_a5_desc:0 "A new corruption is rising in Colthage. Criminals, mercenaries, and souls seduced by the lies of Za'al-Maar have banded together under a crypto-Avian named Zarza. Bent on enforcing soul theft upon all of the equines of colthage and preventing them from reaching ascension. His forces are spread out however, and if we act fast he may quickly fall."
HIE_CTH_a6:0 "The Exalted March Of The Aspirants"
HIE_CTH_a6_desc:0 "The Aspirants are those who have begun to walk the path of truth, they believe they are ready to join one of the legions and serve their master and the Star Father. But first they must prove themselves by slaying the Avian scourge and wiping it from this land."
HIE_CTH_a7:0 "The Bloody Trial Of The Cohorts"
HIE_CTH_a7_desc:0 "The Cohorts wish to begin their journey to the truths of this world, but they have even farther to go than the Aspirants. They must enlighten themselves, achieve wisdom in the face of Za'al-Maar's corruption, and shed the blood of the enemies of equinity."
HIE_CTH_a8:0 "Wage War Upon The Soul Thieves"
HIE_CTH_a8_desc:0 "Soul theft, the disgusting chains of the material world, keep us bound to this realm. The "economic systems" of the world are nothing more than methods of seduction by which equines are kept in chains. So while we still exist in this cursed plane, we must end this process of theft and seize all material for the Covenant war effort."
HIE_CTH_a9:0 "Exalt The Equines Of Bronze And Iron"
HIE_CTH_a9_desc:0 "Those who craft, making the best they can of this material world we are trapped in, are worthy of respect within the Ascendancy. While they do not contribute directly to the destruction of Za'al-Maar, their refutement of soul theft and the goods they create for the cause are more than worthy of recognition."
HIE_CTH_a10:0 "The Wisdom Of The Equines Of Gold"
HIE_CTH_a10_desc:0 "The Equines of Gold are the wisest among us, those who have knowledge of the ways of the spirit world, and who can see clearly through the lies of the servants of Za'al-Maar. They are our leaders, our guides and teachers. Those who shall lead Equinity back to the prophesied spirit world. And the Star Father stands foremost in their ranks."
HIE_CTH_a11:0 "Uncover The Tools Of Resistance"
HIE_CTH_a11_desc:0 "Upon the fall of the Arch-Heathen's regime, her army shattered as soul thieves descended upon our land. Weapons, imported by the cartels, were scattered throughout the land like dust in the wind. We must find these chaches and turn them against the wicked souls who hold us down."
HIE_CTH_a12:0 "Nourish The Bearers Of The Future"
HIE_CTH_a12_desc:0 "The old are often too corrupted by the influence of the Avian to truly understand The Teacher's words. But the young, the young have not yet lived a life in a world controlled by the Avian. They can learn, they can grow into the subjects the Ascendancy needs."
HIE_CTH_a13:0 "Rebuild The Hearths And Homes"
HIE_CTH_a13_desc:0 "The home is the core unit of our new society. It acts as a sanctum where equines may live and practice their craft away from sinister forces. But the hearths have gone out in the war, we must rebuild for the good of our subjets."
HIE_CTH_a14:0 "Bring About The End Of Soul Theft"
HIE_CTH_a14_desc:0 "No more shall the souls of the equines be corrupted by the Avian! These economic systems of the modern age are nothing more than ways the Avians tie us to this realm. Capitalism, the lecherous tumor of the Avian empire begat communism, just another way for the Avians to control us. We refute these ideas! We refute their mental slavery!"
HIE_CTH_a15:0 "The Gift Of Compassion And Benevolence"
HIE_CTH_a15_desc:0 "The wise patricians of the equines of gold have graciously opened their purses to assist in the rebuilding of colthage. The lower castes must be cared for in this time of crisis and in all their wisdom, we shall rise to the occasion."

### Events ###
hippone_sekrit.1.t:0 "The Price Of War"
hippone_sekrit.1.d:0 "TODO - Flavour event about the Star Father's troops "nationalising" the assets of a few industrialists from Zapsa, this includes murdering them and their families for corrupting Equine spirituality by engaging in capitalism, make it sublte, basically unstated that they're going to be murdered"
hippone_sekrit.1.a:0 "Za'al-Maar must be fought in all its forms"

hippone_sekrit.2.t:0 "Body And Mind"
hippone_sekrit.2.d:0 "TODO - Flavour event about Hiram's followers eagerly distributing food and water supplies to their followers, this is as much of a propaganda action as it is humantarianism. It's also very practical. The person distributing the food is a particularly Charismatic Equine of Gold (Think Evangelical Revivalist Preacher) agrandizing the virtues of the Covenant ect"
hippone_sekrit.2.a:0 "Maybe the Star Father isn't so bad..."

hippone_sekrit.3.t:0 "A Safe Haven"
hippone_sekrit.3.d:0 "TODO - Flavour event about the Covenant's Equines of Bronze And Iron doing their jobs and helping out the uninitiated in rebuilding their homes. Much like the Famine event this is both a propaganda and a humantarian action meant to show to the people that the Covenant is not all that bad... Or at least create the perception of it. Preacher character from the previous event should make an apperance again "
hippone_sekrit.3.a:0 "At least we've got rooves over our head again"

hippone_sekrit.4.t:0 "A Field Of Temples"
hippone_sekrit.4.d:0 "TODO - Flavour event about generally helping out the sick and the hungry in massive field hospitals attended to by the Equines Of Gold (Who also include Doctors), aside from helping out the Preacher character from before also makes an apperance preaching the values of healthy eating, a good fitness plan ect as the body is a living temple to the Godhead"
hippone_sekrit.4.a:0 "Nutritional value charts? Those exist?"

hippone_sekrit.5.t:0 "The Auspicious Government"
hippone_sekrit.5.d:0 "TODO - Flavour event about Equines Of Gold basically being appointed by Hiram to various towns, cities, villages ect to rule over them, this is the beginnings of the Covenant's political system which basically boils down to a Chinese style despotic bureaucracy mixed with a caste system and Plato's Republic"
hippone_sekrit.5.a:0 "In time the system shall cement..."

hippone_sekrit.6.t:0 "The Death Of The Old Order"
hippone_sekrit.6.d:0 "TODO - Event about Monzano being executed in Colthage alongside the remnants of Zarishat's old regime, the Zarcaids and the Constitutionalists have long since managed to escape, but still the message is clear, Colthage has fallen"
hippone_sekrit.6.a:0 "The sins of the past redeemed..."

hippone_sekrit.7.t:0 "A Lion Declawed"
hippone_sekrit.7.d:0 "TODO - Event about Zannido 'Bandolier' Zidon being executed, no final words, no anything, he is simply executed alongside all of his followers with his body being left in an unmarked grave somewhere in the countryside."
hippone_sekrit.7.a:0 "One less vermin to deal with"

hippone_sekrit.8.t:0 "The Shining Light"
hippone_sekrit.8.d:0 "TODO - Event about Zarza being offered up as what amounts to a sacrifice by the other leaders of the United Republican Front... Unfortunately the people they are surrendering to are Equines of Silver who promptly just turn their guns on them and kill them all, making sure to leave no survivors"
hippone_sekrit.8.a:0 "Was a muzzleflash"

hippone_sekrit.9.t:0 "The Price Of Art"
hippone_sekrit.9.d:0 "TODO - Flavour event about Colthage being rebuilt in a weird artistic baroque style by POWs who are "redeeming" themselves through labour. Needless to say the Covenant are not exactly being magnanimous following their victory. Those who can't work are killed, and they're generally overseen by Equines Of Bronze and Iron and Equines Of Silver who are enforcing their orders"
hippone_sekrit.9.a:0 "The building blocks of a new dawn"

hippone_sekrit.10.t:0 "The Ascendancy"
hippone_sekrit.10.d:0 "TODO - Event about the Covenant finally stabilising their hold over the nation giving it complete dominion and control over the lands of former Colthage. The Ascendandy of Zebrakind is officially proclaimed much to Hiram and the rest of the Equines Of Golds' joy, and the horror of everyone else"
hippone_sekrit.10.a:0 "Za'al-Maar shall tremble in our wake..."

hippone_sekrit.11.t:0 "The Gift Of Charity"
hippone_sekrit.11.d:0 "TODO - Flavour event about Equines Of Silver and more paramilitary members of the Covenant's forces helping out villages rebuild ect, it's basically a PR campaign, preacher character from before should reappear here"
hippone_sekrit.11.a:0 "Bit by bit"

hippone_sekrit.12.t:0 "Our Grand Victory"
hippone_sekrit.12.d:0 "TODO - Event about the Covenant winning the Civil War... Congrats I guess"
hippone_sekrit.12.a:0 "The Godhead be praised!"

hippone_sekrit.13.t:0 "The Future Of The Nation"
hippone_sekrit.13.d:0 "TODO - Event about some Equine of Gold explaining to their children about how since they were born in their caste they will eventually lead the nation - Hence why they are being sent away to a private school for all the Children of the Equines of Gold, to be raised among their own with minimal parent supervision."
hippone_sekrit.13.a:0 "A necessary method"

hippone_sekrit.14.t:0 "The Rejection Of Temptation"
hippone_sekrit.14.d:0 "TODO - Event about a book burning overseen by the Preacher-esque character established before, the books being burned are primarily books from Griffonia or Hippogriffia, but there's some Socialist and Communist literature being burned there as well. Not a pleasant event but all other literature aside from what fits into the aforementioned criteria is perfectly legal and permissable"
hippone_sekrit.14.a:0 "The influence of Zaal-Maar must be fought in all its forms"

hippone_sekrit.15.t:0 "The Urban Renaissance"
hippone_sekrit.15.d:0 "TODO - Event about the renovations of the city of Zur - Fancy Neo-Baroque Architecture mixed with traditional Colthaginian (Mexican) architecture, plenty of parks and what not - Overall it looks very nice and the people of the city are actually happy about it going out to celebrate a joint fiesta regardless of their Castes and social standing."
hippone_sekrit.15.a:0 "What a nice place"

hippone_sekrit.16.t:0 "The Masters Of Finance"
hippone_sekrit.16.d:0 "TODO - Event about Hiram, abolishing banking and decreeing that the Equines of Silver kill every single private banker in the country, with their assets being seized by the Ascendancy's bureaucracy so that it may be redistributed - A large chunk of these bankers actually supported the Ascendancy during the Civil War being Patricians or Ex-Patricians themselves, so this event does show that the country has stablised to the point that Hiram can have the Covenant's membership pruned when he wishes"
hippone_sekrit.16.a:0 "It was inevitable"

hippone_sekrit.17.t:0 "In The Court Of An Equine Of Gold"
hippone_sekrit.17.d:0 "TODO - Event about an Equine of Gold who got appointed as the supreme judge of Neigheris handing out justice - Not sure what the case should be, but the event should highlight that he's making an effort to be harsh but fair, that being said the punishments the Ascendancy hands out are all fairly horrendous, ranging from mutilation and brandings for minor offences and executions for bigger ones."
hippone_sekrit.17.a:0 "The word of law must be followed"

However it should be noted that due to the sheer diversity of the §rCovenant§!'s leadership, the form this new model economy shall take is still a matter of intense debate.\n\nThe first amongst these factions are the £faction_tur_kurdish §rZynskaites§! led by the Trotkartian equinepologist §rQarnaim Sikarbaalid§!. This faction takes their name from the infamous Zeblu prophet Zynskai, whom ordained that cosmopolitanism and all of its influences must actively be fought against lest the Zeblu are to be destroyed. Thus the £faction_tur_kurdish §rZynskaites§! preach a return to the arcadian lifestyle of the original Zebras, traditional guild based production, the downsizing of urban areas and most importantly of all the militarisation of every aspect of society.\n\nTheir chief rival is the £civ_factory_output §rZidonite§! faction headed by the famed §rZurite§! mathematician §rZisa Zaalatit§!. Their name is an homage to the alleged legendary founder of §YColthage§!, Queen Zido under whom the city began its meteoric rise to the forefront of Zonician politics. As the name suggests the faction is primarily based upon the principles of urban modernisation, reinforcing the §rAscendacy§!'s already existing caste system and the maximisation of the country's industrial and economic output.\n\n£faction_tur_kurdish §rZynskaite§! economic influence is: [HIE.GetAgrarianPopularity]\n£civ_factory_output §rZidonite§! economic influence is: [HIE.GetUrbanitePopularity]"
