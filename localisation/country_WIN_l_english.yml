### Focuses ###
WIN_the_legation_joint_command:0 "The Legation Joint Command"
WIN_the_legation_joint_command_desc:0 "The command of the Legation's "Military" has fallen to a joint command of Chiropterran, Wingbardian, and Colthaginian advisors and strategists. Their skills... vary, but the melting pot of ideas they bring to the table makes our military strong in its diversity, and always able to find new talent."
WIN_colthaginian_support:0 "Colthaginian Logistics"
WIN_colthaginian_support_desc:0 "The Colthaginian department of Legation Command has decided to take up the responsibility of keeping our forces supplied with all the non-military supplies needed by the garrison as well as non-combat military roles. We would be fools to say no to this offer."
WIN_wingbardian_arms:0 "Wingbardian Rifles"
WIN_wingbardian_arms_desc:0 "Wingbardian industry is shaping up to be the backbone of our military production, and a new shipment of weapons is coming in, along with new Wingbardian officers here to assert their military importance within the Legation."
WIN_chiropterran_expertise:0 "Chiropterran Expertise"
WIN_chiropterran_expertise_desc:0 "The Chiropterran General Staff has quickly proved itself to be one of the most skilled military entities on the continent of Zebrica, and their officers will make up the majority of our own command staff, bringing their expertise to our garrison forces."
WIN_nested_artillery:0 "Artillery Utilisation"
WIN_nested_artillery_desc:0 "Colthaginian and Wingbardian industrialists and military personnel have recently imported large amounts of heavy artillery and have begun equipping our garrison units with these weapons. This will hopefully give the legation forces a bit more bite to go with their bark.\n\nThough the bats aren't thrilled about how they weren't consulted..."
WIN_adapt_chemicals:0 "Lachrymator Agent Implementation"
WIN_adapt_chemicals_desc:0 "Now that Winggarden has settled into a state of "normalcy," the reality of the situation is setting in for many hippogriffs. And they have begun to fight back. Our Chiropterran advisor Ocean Spray has a simple solution to this. To be obeyed by all police and army units within the city.\n§R"Gas them all."§!"
WIN_militarized_police_force:0 "Militarise The Police"
WIN_militarized_police_force_desc:0 "To keep further order within the city, the Legation Council has decided it is time to enlist some locals in defense of Winggarden. A new separate constabulary shall be established dealing with matters of national defense different from the local police forces. These Hippogriffs will take oaths of loyalty to the mandate system, and shall serve to ensure Winggarden never returns to Hippogriffia. Hopefully."
WIN_special_command:0 "Special Weapons and Tactics Department"
WIN_special_command_desc:0 "To supplement our new police forces, Generals Pillar and Beep have put a suggestion before the council. A singular unit derived from the most loyal and experienced soldiers of the rest of our forces, equipped and supplied like the elite special forces of the rest of the world. Called S.W.A.T., it shall fall under Beep's command and be the new face of Winggarden's defense."
WIN_a_new_general_command:0 "The Winggarden General Defence Council"
WIN_a_new_general_command_desc:0 "Now that our military command, as well as our rule over the city, have been solidified, we can afford to formalize our military into one cohesive whole. No longer are we a collection of mercenaries and police units, now we are the General Defense Council, the sole body responsible for the city's protection, and the one thing stopping anarchy from taking over."
WIN_local_arms_production:0 "Armament Production Optimisation"
WIN_local_arms_production_desc:0 "We can not afford to continuously bring in foreign weapons. Seriously. The budget can't fit it. In order to solve this, the Legation has sanctioned a local gunsmith open to working with us to open new industrial arms manufacturing facilities to supply the garrison's forces. This should hopefully keep our units supplied and ready to combat any insurgency."
WIN_the_legation_volunteer_force:0 "The Legation Volunteer Force"
WIN_the_legation_volunteer_force_desc:0 "The Winggarden military forces are not a conventional volunteer or even a conscripted army. It is made up of foreign army personnel from our three benefactors, as well as any other foreign volunteers willing to join. As long as they don't have any connections to the Hippogriffs.\n\n§gWe can't trust those bird horses...§!"
WIN_urban_warfare_expertise:0 "Urban Warfare Training"
WIN_urban_warfare_expertise_desc:0 "If we are to resist the calls of "democracy" and "freedom" from our population, we are going to need to know how to fight against any armed rising that may occur. For this, we need our troops to be expertly trained in urban warfare. Training shall be conducted in mock urban environments across North Zebrica in order to ensure our effectiveness."

WIN_chiropterran_fighters:0 "The Legation Shadowbolts"
WIN_chiropterran_fighters_desc:0 "The Chiropterran Shadowbolts are the heirs to Nightmare Moon's areal legacy, and they pride themselves on being some of the best pilots in the world. And so, they have been polite enough to grant us our own regiment of these pilots for our city's defense."
WIN_the_air_cavalry:0 "Air Cavalry Tactics"
WIN_the_air_cavalry_desc:0 "Quick response military units are always of need when one of your chief goals is resistance suppression. And for us, the providers are the elite Paratroopers of the 1st Winggarden Air Cavalry, who will form the core of our elite forces for the foreseeable future."
WIN_pigeoion_contracts:0 "The Pigeonio Contract"
WIN_pigeoion_contracts_desc:0 "A Wingbardian aircraft company has recently offered to set up a new industrial plant within our city, they offer both civilian craft for the rich and powerful as well as military bombers for use against our enemies."
WIN_expand_airport:0 "Expand the Winggarden Airport"
WIN_expand_airport_desc:0 "The Winggarden airport, once the premier civilian airfield of the Hippogriffian south, is now under Legation hands. And it seems that it can serve as a fantastic military airfield for our good friends, the Shadowbolts. We shall also reopen part of it for civilian shipping uses, to keep up appearances at least."
WIN_air_fortifications:0 "Anti-Air Fortifications"
WIN_air_fortifications_desc:0 "Our air warfare capabilities will always be outshone by those of our benefactors, and even those of the Hippogriffs, so in order to defend our skies we must fight fire with ice. Anti-Air battaries are cheap and effective ways to destroy aircraft en masse, Winggarden must not fall!"

It's inhabitents are seaponies, the "other half" of the Hippogriffian realm and it has presented a... unique issue for our administration. None of the three species holding guard over the Legation can breathe underwater, meaning we are having to resort to... unique methods to halt resistance to our rule in this territory."

### Advisors ###
WIN_advisor_1:0 "Gilippo Gappi"
WIN_advisor_1_desc:0 "If there is one creature within Winggarden that could be said to embody what the Legation means for the nations involved, it would be Gilippo Gappi. Once just a minor diplomat in Wingbardy's foreign service, Gappi played an immense role in getting the griffons to seize the chance offered by the Colthaginian and Chiropterran invasion of the Hippogriffs' continental mandate, seeing tremendous economic opportunity in the venture. He had known these lands for years before entering the diplomatic service, serving in the seas around Zebrica as a member of the Wingbardian Navy and Air Force, where he pioneered airship technology and added much of Zebrica to Wingbardian maps. So when Wingbardy needed a diplomat to head their new involvements in Zebrica, Gilippo's application was readily accepted, and he was sent once again to Zebrica to work out treaties with Wingbardy's new allies on the continent. Gilippo was also the griffon who sat at the negotiating table with the Hippogriffs and placed before them the now-infamous Twelve Concessions. With the Legation being a concession of his own inception. An international zone jointly ruled by the three nations.\n\nBut this is where Gappi faltered. He believed that the legation would be able to exist in perpetual peace. But now, with the reality of the Legation's situation clear to him, he has joined in its great game to ensure the interests of his nation come out on top.\n\n§OViva il Re e viva alla nazione!§!\n\n"
WIN_advisor_2:0 "Ocean Spray"
WIN_advisor_2_desc:0 "Ocean Spray was born to a couple of Silver Moon Legion Soldiers forty-four years ago, entering the service as quickly as he could, he slowly began to climb the Legion's ranks, but not in the way most did. He was not a military bat, but a pencil-pushing bureaucrat, though one adept at his job. In his early thirties, he signed up for the LMRD, serving to organize and structure their less savory business into a form more palatable by the rest of the Legions. This work gained him the attention of Emerald Light, who marked the Bat down for a higher position at a later time. That time came at Chiropterra's triumph over the Hippogriffs, when it and its allies established Winggarden. While the Council of Legions was looking for a bat to send, Emerald put Ocean Spray forth. He was competent, pious, and seemed like a good choice. But he was also personally loyal to his Silver Moon legion, a detail Commander Light was sure to leave out.\n\nPersonally, Spray is no kind soul. He is a harsh bat, and is only a bit nicer to his friends than enemies and only has a few hobbies. He holds a general disdain for the hippogriff and seapony populations, and is always preparing for a struggle against them. He often chides against his fellow representatives, continually wishing to assure his control over the Legation military, sometimes even against the other Chiropterran commanders' advice. Many question why someone as un-charasmatic as him was placed as the Chiropterran representative.\n\nSecretly though, this is all part of Chiropterra's place in the great game of Winggarden. Once a month Ocean Spray receives two letters. One from the Legionary Council and Warmaster [BAT.getleader], his "official" orders, and another delievered to him secretly, Operation Nightlight, Winggarden's place in Lunar dominance of Zebrica, and then, further beyond.\n\n§CHe serves Her Imperial Majesty, Nightmare Moon, and the Silver Legion above all other things, and he will not betray his duty.\n\n"
