### Focuses ###
WIN_the_legation_joint_command:0 "The Legation Joint Command"
WIN_the_legation_joint_command_desc:0 "The command of the Legation's "Military" has fallen to a joint command of Chiropterran, Wingbardian, and Colthaginian advisors and strategists. Their skills... vary, but the melting pot of ideas they bring to the table makes our military strong in its diversity, and always able to find new talent."
WIN_colthaginian_support:0 "Colthaginian Logistics"
WIN_colthaginian_support_desc:0 "The Colthaginian department of Legation Command has decided to take up the responsibility of keeping our forces supplied with all the non-military supplies needed by the garrison as well as non-combat military roles. We would be fools to say no to this offer."
WIN_wingbardian_arms:0 "Wingbardian Rifles"
WIN_wingbardian_arms_desc:0 "Wingbardian industry is shaping up to be the backbone of our military production, and a new shipment of weapons is coming in, along with new Wingbardian officers here to assert their military importance within the Legation."
WIN_chiropterran_expertise:0 "Chiropterran Expertise"
WIN_chiropterran_expertise_desc:0 "The Chiropterran General Staff has quickly proved itself to be one of the most skilled military entities on the continent of Zebrica, and their officers will make up the majority of our own command staff, bringing their expertise to our garrison forces."
WIN_nested_artillery:0 "Artillery Utilisation"
WIN_nested_artillery_desc:0 "Colthaginian and Wingbardian industrialists and military personnel have recently imported large amounts of heavy artillery and have begun equipping our garrison units with these weapons. This will hopefully give the legation forces a bit more bite to go with their bark.\n\nThough the bats aren't thrilled about how they weren't consulted..."
WIN_adapt_chemicals:0 "Lachrymator Agent Implementation"
WIN_adapt_chemicals_desc:0 "Now that Winggarden has settled into a state of "normalcy," the reality of the situation is setting in for many hippogriffs. And they have begun to fight back. Our Chiropterran advisor Ocean Spray has a simple solution to this. To be obeyed by all police and army units within the city.\n§R"Gas them all."§!"
WIN_militarized_police_force:0 "Militarise The Police"
WIN_militarized_police_force_desc:0 "To keep further order within the city, the Legation Council has decided it is time to enlist some locals in defense of Winggarden. A new separate constabulary shall be established dealing with matters of national defense different from the local police forces. These Hippogriffs will take oaths of loyalty to the mandate system, and shall serve to ensure Winggarden never returns to Hippogriffia. Hopefully."
WIN_special_command:0 "Special Weapons and Tactics Department"
WIN_special_command_desc:0 "To supplement our new police forces, Generals Pillar and Beep have put a suggestion before the council. A singular unit derived from the most loyal and experienced soldiers of the rest of our forces, equipped and supplied like the elite special forces of the rest of the world. Called S.W.A.T., it shall fall under Beep's command and be the new face of Winggarden's defense."
WIN_a_new_general_command:0 "The Winggarden General Defence Council"
WIN_a_new_general_command_desc:0 "Now that our military command, as well as our rule over the city, have been solidified, we can afford to formalize our military into one cohesive whole. No longer are we a collection of mercenaries and police units, now we are the General Defense Council, the sole body responsible for the city's protection, and the one thing stopping anarchy from taking over."
WIN_local_arms_production:0 "Armament Production Optimisation"
WIN_local_arms_production_desc:0 "We can not afford to continuously bring in foreign weapons. Seriously. The budget can't fit it. In order to solve this, the Legation has sanctioned a local gunsmith open to working with us to open new industrial arms manufacturing facilities to supply the garrison's forces. This should hopefully keep our units supplied and ready to combat any insurgency."
WIN_the_legation_volunteer_force:0 "Bolster the Legation Volunteer Force"
WIN_the_legation_volunteer_force_desc:0 "The Winggarden military forces are not a conventional volunteer or even a conscripted army. It is made up of foreign army personnel from our three benefactors, as well as any other foreign volunteers willing to join. As long as they don't have any connections to the Hippogriffs.\n\n§gWe can't trust those bird horses...§!"
WIN_urban_warfare_expertise:0 "Urban Warfare Training"
WIN_urban_warfare_expertise_desc:0 "If we are to resist the calls of "democracy" and "freedom" from our population, we are going to need to know how to fight against any armed rising that may occur. For this, we need our troops to be expertly trained in urban warfare. Training shall be conducted in mock urban environments across North Zebrica in order to ensure our effectiveness."

WIN_chiropterran_fighters:0 "The Legation Shadowbolts"
WIN_chiropterran_fighters_desc:0 "The Chiropterran Shadowbolts are the heirs to Nightmare Moon's areal legacy, and they pride themselves on being some of the best pilots in the world. And so, they have been polite enough to grant us our own regiment of these pilots for our city's defense."
WIN_the_air_cavalry:0 "Air Cavalry Tactics"
WIN_the_air_cavalry_desc:0 "Quick response military units are always of need when one of your chief goals is resistance suppression. And for us, the providers are the elite Paratroopers of the 1st Winggarden Air Cavalry, who will form the core of our elite forces for the foreseeable future."
WIN_pigeoion_contracts:0 "The Pigeonio Contract"
WIN_pigeoion_contracts_desc:0 "A Wingbardian aircraft company has recently offered to set up a new industrial plant within our city, they offer both civilian craft for the rich and powerful as well as military bombers for use against our enemies."
WIN_expand_airport:0 "Expand the Winggarden Airport"
WIN_expand_airport_desc:0 "The Winggarden airport, once the premier civilian airfield of the Hippogriffian south, is now under Legation control. And it seems that it can serve as a fantastic military airfield for our good friends, the Shadowbolts. We shall also reopen part of it for civilian shipping uses, to keep up appearances at least."
WIN_air_fortifications:0 "Anti-Air Fortifications"
WIN_air_fortifications_desc:0 "Our air warfare capabilities will always be outshone by those of our benefactors, and even those of the Hippogriffs, so in order to defend our skies we must fight fire with ice. Anti-Air battaries are cheap and effective ways to destroy aircraft en masse, Winggarden must not fall!"

WIN_the_establishment:0 "Ab Urbe Condita"
WIN_the_establishment_desc:0 "Long live Winggarden!\n\nAnd may whatever gods our leaders believe in bless them in keeping this place together..."
WIN_foritifcations:0 "Urban Redoubts"
WIN_foritifcations_desc:0 "The safety of our oasis of prosperity is continuously threatened from without and within. Our benefactors, anxious to keep control, have provided funding to fortify certain buildings throughout the city in order to secure our hold on the city. We must never let the Hippogriffs take it back!"
WIN_a_forum_for_peace:0 "A Forum Of Peace"
WIN_a_forum_for_peace_desc:0 "The prime architect of the Legation, Gilippo Gappi, sees this place as a "Forum of Peace", where the powers involved can all gain something, and any creature who wants a chance to rise higher can do it here. The Chiropterrans and Colthaginians have... a different view. But since it was Gappi who formed this government, his vision will win out for now."
WIN_a_stratified_bureaucracy:0 "Stratify the Bureaucracy"
WIN_a_stratified_bureaucracy_desc:0 "The majority of the low-level bureaucrats that make Winggarden state run smoothly are from Colthage, and thus they have strong influence over the day to day running of the Legation. They have thus introduced a bill that officializes their control, establishing quotas for the national origin of certain officials, and ensuring they come out on top."
WIN_improve_trade_relations:0 "The Gappi Plan"
WIN_improve_trade_relations_desc:0 "Gappi has recently proposed another plan to the legation council, it will virtually abolish all trade tariffs within Winggarden, allowing goods and commerce to flow freely under the Legation's watchful eye. Considering the Legation's position, this will be of clear benefit to us, but it will also benefit the free trade interests of the Wingbardian representatives, increasing their influence over Legation policy."
WIN_balance_the_council:0 "Balance The Interests"
WIN_balance_the_council_desc:0 "Things have gotten a bit hectic down here in the legation, we're losing control, and our benefactors are starting to get suspicious of one another, thankfully we have one chance to make this right. Article 43b of the Winggarden Legation charter has a contingency where we can completely wipe clean our government and call on the benefactors to hash out a new one. But they won't stand for this more than once."
WIN_tighten_the_grip:0 "Tighten the Grip"
WIN_tighten_the_grip_desc:0 "Now that the Legation has formed itself into a "nation" and not just a motley crew of foreigners, we can begin to further exert our influence on this land. The Twelve Concessions are extremely vague when it comes to how much control we have, and we can use that to our advantage. Applying more pressure on Hippogrifia, we can gain more of an advantage over them, and further pressure them into decline."
WIN_an_intelligence_agency:0 "The Legation Security Service"
WIN_an_intelligence_agency_desc:0 "The Legation security service is a compound effort between all three of our benefactors. While run mainly by bats, this is a truly collaborative effort to crush all resistance to the Legation's governance through more secretive means. The Security Service's job is to ensure that our new status quo holds, and that this city thrives away from Hippogriff control."
WIN_hippogriff_volunteers:0 "The Hippogriff Volunteer Department"
WIN_hippogriff_volunteers_desc:0 "Now that our government has settled in, and the immediate threat of armed rebellion has passed, we have decided it is time to begin recruiting select locals into our police force and military. While foreigners will still make up the bulk of our forces, we can supplement them with hippogriffs just to make up the slack."

WIN_commission_a_fleet:0 "Commission the Fleet"
WIN_commission_a_fleet_desc:0 ""
WIN_underwater_antipartisan_operations:0 "Submarine Anti-Partisan Operations"
WIN_underwater_antipartisan_operations_desc:0 "Roughly half of the Legation's de jure territory lies beneath the water's surface. It's inhabitents are seaponies, the "other half" of the Hippogriffian realm and it has presented a... unique issue for our administration. None of the three species holding guard over the Legation can breathe underwater, meaning we are having to resort to... unique methods to halt resistance to our rule in this territory."

WIN_build_up_shipyards:0 "Fund the Shipyards"
WIN_build_up_shipyards_desc:0 ""

WIN_the_tram_system:0 "Modernise the Tram System"
WIN_the_tram_system_desc:0 "Wingarden already has an extensive tram system, even if it has not aged with grace. The combined resources of our benefactors, however, means that we will be able to court the services of some of the world's finest engineers, and in time we can make this tram system the most modern in the world!"
WIN_the_development_bank:0 "The Winggarden Development Fund"
WIN_the_development_bank_desc:0 "Despite our benefactors' differences, all are interested in seeing Winggarden prosper. Consolidating the resources we've acquired since the 12 concessions, we will be able to build up a new bank to specifically help with the development of the city."
WIN_colthaginian_companies:0 "Invite Colthaginian Companies"
WIN_colthaginian_companies_desc:0 "Our Colthaginian benefactors are an economic powerhouse. It would not take much to ensure that their conglomerates can install themselves in Winggarden, increasing their influence and our industrial capacity both."
WIN_AGWP_investments:0 "AGWP Contracts"
WIN_AGWP_investments_desc:0 "The Wingbardian delegate has been in contact with one of the premier Wingbardian petrochemical companies, and they've signalled their interest in establishing themselves in the city. Not only would it mean Winggarden becomes the center of a world-class oil refinery, it would also be a fine feather in representative Gappi's hat."
WIN_develop_the_arsenal:0 "The Winggarden Arsenal"
WIN_develop_the_arsenal_desc:0 "Prosperity begets envy, and if Winggarden is to ensure that the prosperity built up within her city limits remains in her hooves, she must be ready to defend it. None has questioned this particular point, and for once the three representatives put equal enthusiasm into arraging for Winggarden's military industrial complex to grow."
WIN_setup_chiropterran_homes:0 "Chiropterran Military Towns"
WIN_setup_chiropterran_homes_desc:0 "Ocean Spray has argued quite fervently for the adoption of the Chiropterran system of military towns. While it would put certain quarters of the city beyond the other representatives' grasp, it would also, undoubtedly, help to fortify Winggarden in case of an attack."
WIN_seize_hippogriff_companies:0 "Nationalise Hippogriff Companies"
WIN_seize_hippogriff_companies_desc:0 "The local Hippogriff companies are a security risk, one that must be dealt with. While they've by and large played by the rules set forth, they are obvious vectors for the Hippogriffs to attempt to reassert themselves, or at least introduce spies into the city. It'll cause a stir, but they should be nationalized and placed under our control."
WIN_import_experts:0 "Invite Financial Experts"
WIN_import_experts_desc:0 "Many times, the sound advice of financial experts will get hampered by political necessity, but thankfully Winggarden offers more freedom than that. Our far-reaching control along with our sound business laws mean that economic reforms will not only be tolerable, but welcome. It's time we let the world's top financial minds know this."
WIN_the_city_on_the_hill:0 "The City On A Hill"
WIN_the_city_on_the_hill_desc:0 "Winggarden has become something something rarely seen before in this world; a place where competition can reign supreme. Whether competition between our representatives, benefactors, companies or citizens, we all stand tall upon the hill where we built our paradise, and all will scratch and claw their way up that hill for a chance to partake in the prosperity that is the rightful reward of the victors." 
WIN_develop_fuel_stores:0 "The Legation Municipal Fuel Reserve"
WIN_develop_fuel_stores_desc:0 "The ever belligerent Ocean Spray has lobbied quite fervently for the creation of a municipal fuel reserve, arguing that if we are cut off from our trade partners we must be able to rely on our own fuel reserves. This 'dagger to our necks' must be addressed he insists, and of course the fact that it will advance his own goals is surely merely a coincidence." 
WIN_develop_steel_milling:0 "Develop Steel Milling"
WIN_develop_steel_milling_desc:0 "The number one metal of the modern world is not gold or silver, but steel, and Winggarden has the potential to master this metal as well as well. Negotiations with foreign steel companies have already begun, and we have half a dozen companies eagerly bidding for place in the new industrial park designated for the purpose."
WIN_high_rises:0 "The Mile High Club"
WIN_high_rises_desc:0 "Winggarden is a small place, and real estate is hard to come by. The solition is simple; build upwards! Winggarden will become a mountain range of high-rises reaching up against the sky, and in this we will become the very image of the future city, even if we have to expropriate some locals' residences to achieve it."

legation.4.t:0 "My Chemical Romance"
legation.4.d:0 "Deep within the tunnels below Winggarden, a group of military officers runs down a dimly lit hallway. Once one of the city's defensive redoubts against invasion, this tunnel network now serves as the paths by which the Legation military quickly moves about the city. And storming down corridor 3c, with papers in hoof, comes generals Marble Pillar and Sonar Beep. Inbound on room 14, also known as "The Nightmare Chamber," the office of Ocean Spray.\n\nEntering the room with a slam of the door, the figures already in the room turn to face them. Generals Zaladid and Gevese had already arrived and were speaking with Ocean Spray, after a couple of quick salutes the Chiropterrans place down the papers they'd been holding. Detailed maps of what was going on in the city. For the first time in the Legation's history, there was an organized mass protest on the streets. The shock of losing the war had kept the Hippogriffs tame for a while, but now they were back and angry.\n\nGeneral Pillar began, "They've occupied some of the main boulevards, the port, and the plaza around city hall. Gilippo is under siege in there and needs to be relieved. We've been preparing for this day for a while now, and we need to act fast. His guards can only hold out so long. I, for one, favor a strike operation to get him out, followed by a conventional surround tactic up Lunar Road and starving the protest out. They'll back down eventually. Zaladid then spoke up, "These protesters will be at our necks if we let them stay around any longer. We need to march a single column up the street, and they will part and let us through to Gappi. Or we will make them."\n\nThe commanders debated for a minute, not quite coming to a consensus before Ocean Spray himself lifted a hoof, "Gentlecreatures, the solution here is simple. A few days ago, I received a personal gift from my Lady Commander Emerald Light, which we can use to sort out this issue nice and quick." The commanders around Spray leaned in, intrigued what the Chiropterran representative had received. "We have been blessed by the Nightmare," Spray triumphantly declared, "with a shipment of methylphosphonofluoridate."\n\nThe generals stood for a moment, unsure what Ocean Spray meant. Reading the room, he explained, "Also known as sarin gas." At this, the room exploded, general Gevese spit out the coffee and began to curse wildly in his native tongue. Zaladid slammed his hoof on the desk and exclaimed, "Are you insane! Are you recommending we unleash a nerve agent on the population of the city! In the middle of the government district!" "By the Nightmare, I am general!" Spray responded. As their voices rose, a crack shot up in the air as general Sonar Beep fired a blank out of his pistol into the air. "Representative Spray! You are not a military officer, the use of sarin gas on the population will not be authorized. Though if I remember, you also received tear gas in that shipment. Something much more appropriate for the situation. We must act fast, I move we authorize the police to use this tear gas to disperse the protestors, and then we move in to get Gappi out of there. All in favor?"\n\nAll in the room besides Spray raised their hooves and claws. "Passed. Now let's get moving.""
legation.4.a:0 "Did somepony give him his pills for the day?"

legation.5.t:0 "On Patrol"
legation.5.d:0 "The two massive police officers - one griffon and one thestral - slowly strode down the street, both of them clad in heavy combat armor and carrying massive twelve milimeter rifles. Neither of them seemed overly encumbered by it either, and as they approached, hippogriffs, ponies and zebras all got out of the way in fear. The street market had been bustling, but now it was near empty, with only the occasional stall owners trying desperately to pack their wares up and step out of the way. One of the stall owners dropped a box of fruits, one of them rolling over the pavement and coming to a stop right in front of the leading griffon, who stopped and stared the shall owner down before picking up the orange.\n\n"Your papers, citizen?" the griffon asked, his voice rumbling inside the massive armor. The hippogriff backed away in fear at first, but the sight of the massive weapons made him dismiss any thought of fleeing, and he slowly walked behind the stall and took out his papers, which the thestral took and looked over, putting the orange back in the box.\n\n"These permits are due for renewal," the thestral informed him, the hippogriff stammering out an apology before being cut off. "Also, while you apply, make sure to ask for a AV-11 permit regarding fresh fruit, it was only signed into law a week ago, and may have missed it."\n\n"I-um... yes..." the Hippogriff began, trailing off.\n\n"Make sure to inform your fellow salescreatures of this as well," the griffon told him, "This market has done a lot of good for the local community, and it would be a shame to see it closed down. We will be patrolling here regularly, so do not hesitate to ask us if you have any questions. We are based at 5th Claw and Beak, and all relevant forms can be found there. Is there anything else you need, citizen?"\n\n"I don't think so?" the hippogriff didn't know what to think of this entire thing. The two officers simply nodded in response.\n\n"Good day, citizen," the thestral said as they began down the street again, leaving the market goers and stall owners to peek out from their hiding spots after the pair."

legation.6.d:0 ""You are the hammer that will crush all that stand before the legation authorities!" The thestral thundered as he walked back and forth in front of the black-clothed, heavily armored police officers, "Like a dagger, you will cut to the very heart of those who stand defiant, wreaking such havoc that-"\n\nBAP! his voice was cut off as the baton hit his leg and he gasped in pain, clutching his leg as he hobbled to the side, revealing the police chief that had come up behind him.\n\n"What he MEANT TO SAY..." the police chief said patiently, glaring at the police captain as he nursed his bruised leg, "Is that as part of our policing strategy, we aim to keep the regular officers for regular police work, and deploy the elite - you - for situations that exceed their capacities. Hostage situations, armed robberies, crazed mages, and so forth." The captain had recovered by now and came up to continue.\n\n"And to this end, you must be ready to wreak the ultimate violence upon all that stand before you. Give neither quarter nor mercy, for-"BAP!\n\n"He MEANS that you must above all else be disciplined and predictable in the field. Those who resist must be subdued, those who use lethal force must be neutralized, those who comply must be safe. There cannot be any doubt among the citizenry about what will lead to what. If they play along, they are safe, if they don't, they will be dealt with."\n\n"And above all else!" The captain began again, "Remember that you are instruments of vengeance-"BAP!\n\n"Of law and order..." the chief sighed. "When you are deployed, you are still police officers, and a successful deployment will not only deal with the issue at hoof, but it will also impress the population and show them just how capable the WPD is. This will inspire confidence, and confidence in the police will-"BAP! The captain had barely even opened his mouth this time. "-lead to trust. Each and every one here will have the highest standards placed on them for that reason. The eyes of the world will be upon you, and if we do well, we will be the vanguard of a new era. Good luck, officers.""

If you didn't trust them, you still had to carry out their orders, and the best thing an officer could do was to believe, and to trust.\n\nCaptain Galbo reminded himself of this again and again as the furious banging on the walls of his submarine began once more. Twelve years in the Wingbardian navy, several commendations and a chance to serve abroad in Zebrica, and yet this was where he had ended up?\n\n"Deploy the divers," he ordered quietly, and one of his officers moved as fast as she could over the by now padded floors and towards the diving lock, where she silently gave a signal to the six officers who had spent eight hours inside their wetsuits, waiting for this moment. Closing the hatch, they silently filled it with water from the ballast tanks so that it would not be noticed from the outside, and the officers all quietly put the masks over their faces, using the new Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatuses to be able to breathe even as the lock filled with water.\n\nWhen the airlock finally opened, his divers shot out of it as fast as their artificial fins could propel them, out at the seaponies that had clustered around the submarine to vandalize it, as they did every time. Not this time though, with their new gear, his officers would be almost as fast as the seaponies.\n\nOr they would be, if the seaponies had not come prepared with nets, and all his officers had for their rapid deployment was swimming straight into the nets like panicked fishes. With the seaponies descending on them, tearing off their fins and covering them in sea life, all Captain Galbo was left with was four humiliated officers coming back through the diving lock covered in starfishes and clams just as the knockinfg began again."

### Advisors ###
WIN_advisor_1:0 "Gilippo Gappi"
WIN_advisor_1_desc:0 "If there is one creature within Winggarden that could be said to embody what the Legation means for the nations involved, it would be Gilippo Gappi. Once just a minor diplomat in Wingbardy's foreign service, Gappi played an immense role in getting the griffons to seize the chance offered by the Colthaginian and Chiropterran invasion of the Hippogriffs' continental mandate, seeing tremendous economic opportunity in the venture. He had known these lands for years before entering the diplomatic service, serving in the seas around Zebrica as a member of the Wingbardian Navy and Air Force, where he pioneered airship technology and added much of Zebrica to Wingbardian maps. So when Wingbardy needed a diplomat to head their new involvements in Zebrica, Gilippo's application was readily accepted, and he was sent once again to Zebrica to work out treaties with Wingbardy's new allies on the continent. Gilippo was also the griffon who sat at the negotiating table with the Hippogriffs and placed before them the now-infamous Twelve Concessions. With the Legation being a concession of his own inception. An international zone jointly ruled by the three nations.\n\nBut this is where Gappi faltered. He believed that the legation would be able to exist in perpetual peace. But now, with the reality of the Legation's situation clear to him, he has joined in its great game to ensure the interests of his nation come out on top.\n\n§OViva il Re e viva alla nazione!§!\n\n"
WIN_advisor_2:0 "Ocean Spray"
WIN_advisor_2_desc:0 "Ocean Spray was born to a couple of Silver Moon Legion Soldiers forty-four years ago, entering the service as quickly as he could, he slowly began to climb the Legion's ranks, but not in the way most did. He was not a military bat, but a pencil-pushing bureaucrat, though one adept at his job. In his early thirties, he signed up for the LMRD, serving to organize and structure their less savory business into a form more palatable by the rest of the Legions. This work gained him the attention of Emerald Light, who marked the Bat down for a higher position at a later time. That time came at Chiropterra's triumph over the Hippogriffs, when it and its allies established Winggarden. While the Council of Legions was looking for a bat to send, Emerald put Ocean Spray forth. He was competent, pious, and seemed like a good choice. But he was also personally loyal to his Silver Moon legion, a detail Commander Light was sure to leave out.\n\nPersonally, Spray is no kind soul. He is a harsh bat, and is only a bit nicer to his friends than enemies and only has a few hobbies. He holds a general disdain for the hippogriff and seapony populations, and is always preparing for a struggle against them. He often chides against his fellow representatives, continually wishing to assure his control over the Legation military, sometimes even against the other Chiropterran commanders' advice. Many question why someone as un-charasmatic as him was placed as the Chiropterran representative.\n\nSecretly though, this is all part of Chiropterra's place in the great game of Winggarden. Once a month Ocean Spray receives two letters. One from the Legionary Council and Warmaster [BAT.getleader], his "official" orders, and another delievered to him secretly, Operation Nightlight, Winggarden's place in Lunar dominance of Zebrica, and then, further beyond.\n\n§CHe serves Her Imperial Majesty, Nightmare Moon, and the Silver Legion above all other things, and he will not betray his duty.\n\n"
WIN_advisor_3:0 "Azizelqart Zahummid"
WIN_advisor_3_desc:0 "Azizelqart Zahummid is a name most in Colthage will know, but they can't tell you much about him. His whole life, he has been an economist working in the back rooms of Colthagian government to guide its ship of state. A member of Zamilcar Zarca's favored Scientific Clique, he fled with Zalathel when the Storm King arrived and served in his cabinet when he reestablished his rule over Colthage, earning him a high place in the economics ministry. In this regard, many would be content to stop there, sit on their rear end, and make a happy and healthy living. And Azizelqart was content for a long time, until he read Gappi's documents regarding the opportunities in establishing the Legation. It made something burn deep within him, an opportunity to try his economic theories in a land where he had near-total control of the economic sphere. So, he drafted his proposal to Zalathel and submitted it, requesting the spot as Colthage's representative in the Legation, and promising great things should his efforts be supported. And so he was sent to Winggarden with a blank cheque. To do as he sees fit, and to bring prosperity to Colthage.\n\n§gFor the good of all its citizens.§!\n\n"
