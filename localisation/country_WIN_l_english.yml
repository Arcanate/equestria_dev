### Focuses ###
WIN_the_legation_joint_command:0 "The Legation Joint Command"
WIN_the_legation_joint_command_desc:0 "The command of the Legation's "Military" has fallen to a joint command of Chiropterran, Wingbardian, and Colthaginian advisors and strategists. Their skills... vary, but the melting pot of ideas they bring to the table makes our military strong in its diversity, and always able to find new talent."
WIN_colthaginian_support:0 "Colthaginian Logistics"
WIN_colthaginian_support_desc:0 "The Colthaginian department of Legation Command has decided to take up the responsibility of keeping our forces supplied with all the non-military supplies needed by the garrison as well as non-combat military roles. We would be fools to say no to this offer."
WIN_wingbardian_arms:0 "Wingbardian Rifles"
WIN_wingbardian_arms_desc:0 "Wingbardian industry is shaping up to be the backbone of our military production, and a new shipment of weapons is coming in, along with new Wingbardian officers here to assert their military importance within the Legation."
WIN_chiropterran_expertise:0 "Chiropterran Expertise"
WIN_chiropterran_expertise_desc:0 "The Chiropterran General Staff has quickly proved itself to be one of the most skilled military entities on the continent of Zebrica, and their officers will make up the majority of our own command staff, bringing their expertise to our garrison forces."
WIN_nested_artillery:0 "Artillery Utilisation"
WIN_nested_artillery_desc:0 "Colthaginian and Wingbardian industrialists and military personnel have recently imported large amounts of heavy artillery and have begun equipping our garrison units with these weapons. This will hopefully give the legation forces a bit more bite to go with their bark.\n\nThough the bats aren't thrilled about how they weren't consulted..."
WIN_adapt_chemicals:0 "Lachrymator Agent Implementation"
WIN_adapt_chemicals_desc:0 "Now that Winggarden has settled into a state of "normalcy," the reality of the situation is setting in for many hippogriffs. And they have begun to fight back. Our Chiropterran advisor Ocean Spray has a simple solution to this. To be obeyed by all police and army units within the city.\n§R"Gas them all."§!"
WIN_militarized_police_force:0 "Militarise The Police"
WIN_militarized_police_force_desc:0 "To keep further order within the city, the Legation Council has decided it is time to enlist some locals in defense of Winggarden. A new separate constabulary shall be established dealing with matters of national defense different from the local police forces. These Hippogriffs will take oaths of loyalty to the mandate system, and shall serve to ensure Winggarden never returns to Hippogriffia. Hopefully."
WIN_special_command:0 "Special Weapons and Tactics Department"
WIN_special_command_desc:0 "To supplement our new police forces, Generals Pillar and Beep have put a suggestion before the council. A singular unit derived from the most loyal and experienced soldiers of the rest of our forces, equipped and supplied like the elite special forces of the rest of the world. Called S.W.A.T., it shall fall under Beep's command and be the new face of Winggarden's defense."
WIN_a_new_general_command:0 "The Winggarden General Defence Council"
WIN_a_new_general_command_desc:0 "Now that our military command, as well as our rule over the city, have been solidified, we can afford to formalize our military into one cohesive whole. No longer are we a collection of mercenaries and police units, now we are the General Defense Council, the sole body responsible for the city's protection, and the one thing stopping anarchy from taking over."
WIN_local_arms_production:0 "Armament Production Optimisation"
WIN_local_arms_production_desc:0 "We can not afford to continuously bring in foreign weapons. Seriously. The budget can't fit it. In order to solve this, the Legation has sanctioned a local gunsmith open to working with us to open new industrial arms manufacturing facilities to supply the garrison's forces. This should hopefully keep our units supplied and ready to combat any insurgency."
WIN_the_legation_volunteer_force:0 "Bolster the Legation Volunteer Force"
WIN_the_legation_volunteer_force_desc:0 "The Winggarden military forces are not a conventional volunteer or even a conscripted army. It is made up of foreign army personnel from our three benefactors, as well as any other foreign volunteers willing to join. As long as they don't have any connections to the Hippogriffs.\n\n§gWe can't trust those bird horses...§!"
WIN_urban_warfare_expertise:0 "Urban Warfare Training"
WIN_urban_warfare_expertise_desc:0 "If we are to resist the calls of "democracy" and "freedom" from our population, we are going to need to know how to fight against any armed rising that may occur. For this, we need our troops to be expertly trained in urban warfare. Training shall be conducted in mock urban environments across North Zebrica in order to ensure our effectiveness."

WIN_chiropterran_fighters:0 "The Legation Shadowbolts"
WIN_chiropterran_fighters_desc:0 "The Chiropterran Shadowbolts are the heirs to Nightmare Moon's areal legacy, and they pride themselves on being some of the best pilots in the world. And so, they have been polite enough to grant us our own regiment of these pilots for our city's defense."
WIN_the_air_cavalry:0 "Air Cavalry Tactics"
WIN_the_air_cavalry_desc:0 "Quick response military units are always of need when one of your chief goals is resistance suppression. And for us, the providers are the elite Paratroopers of the 1st Winggarden Air Cavalry, who will form the core of our elite forces for the foreseeable future."
WIN_pigeoion_contracts:0 "The Pigeonio Contract"
WIN_pigeoion_contracts_desc:0 "A Wingbardian aircraft company has recently offered to set up a new industrial plant within our city, they offer both civilian craft for the rich and powerful as well as military bombers for use against our enemies."
WIN_expand_airport:0 "Expand the Winggarden Airport"
WIN_expand_airport_desc:0 "The Winggarden airport, once the premier civilian airfield of the Hippogriffian south, is now under Legation control. And it seems that it can serve as a fantastic military airfield for our good friends, the Shadowbolts. We shall also reopen part of it for civilian shipping uses, to keep up appearances at least."
WIN_air_fortifications:0 "Anti-Air Fortifications"
WIN_air_fortifications_desc:0 "Our air warfare capabilities will always be outshone by those of our benefactors, and even those of the Hippogriffs, so in order to defend our skies we must fight fire with ice. Anti-Air battaries are cheap and effective ways to destroy aircraft en masse, Winggarden must not fall!"

WIN_the_establishment:0 "Ab Urbe Condita"
WIN_the_establishment_desc:0 "Long live Winggarden!\n\nAnd may whatever gods our leaders believe in bless them in keeping this place together..."
WIN_foritifcations:0 "Urban Redoubts"
WIN_foritifcations_desc:0 "The safety of our oasis of prosperity is continuously threatened from without and within. Our benefactors, anxious to keep control, have provided funding to fortify certain buildings throughout the city in order to secure our hold on the city. We must never let the Hippogriffs take it back!"
WIN_a_forum_for_peace:0 "A Forum Of Peace"
WIN_a_forum_for_peace_desc:0 "The prime architect of the Legation, Gilippo Gappi, sees this place as a "Forum of Peace", where the powers involved can all gain something, and any creature who wants a chance to rise higher can do it here. The Chiropterrans and Colthaginians have... a different view. But since it was Gappi who formed this government, his vision will win out for now."
WIN_a_stratified_bureaucracy:0 "Stratify the Bureaucracy"
WIN_a_stratified_bureaucracy_desc:0 "The majority of the low-level bureaucrats that make Winggarden state run smoothly are from Colthage, and thus they have strong influence over the day to day running of the Legation. They have thus introduced a bill that officializes their control, establishing quotas for the national origin of certain officials, and ensuring they come out on top."
WIN_improve_trade_relations:0 "The Gappi Plan"
WIN_improve_trade_relations_desc:0 "Gappi has recently proposed another plan to the legation council, it will virtually abolish all trade tariffs within Winggarden, allowing goods and commerce to flow freely under the Legation's watchful eye. Considering the Legation's position, this will be of clear benefit to us, but it will also benefit the free trade interests of the Wingbardian representatives, increasing their influence over Legation policy."
WIN_balance_the_council:0 "Balance The Interests"
WIN_balance_the_council_desc:0 "Things have gotten a bit hectic down here in the legation, we're losing control, and our benefactors are starting to get suspicious of one another, thankfully we have one chance to make this right. Article 43b of the Winggarden Legation charter has a contingency where we can completely wipe clean our government and call on the benefactors to hash out a new one. But they won't stand for this more than once."
WIN_tighten_the_grip:0 "Tighten the Grip"
WIN_tighten_the_grip_desc:0 "Now that the Legation has formed itself into a "nation" and not just a motley crew of foreigners, we can begin to further exert our influence on this land. The Twelve Concessions are extremely vague when it comes to how much control we have, and we can use that to our advantage. Applying more pressure on Hippogrifia, we can gain more of an advantage over them, and further pressure them into decline."
WIN_an_intelligence_agency:0 "The Legation Security Service"
WIN_an_intelligence_agency_desc:0 "The Legation security service is a compound effort between all three of our benefactors. While run mainly by bats, this is a truly collaborative effort to crush all resistance to the Legation's governance through more secretive means. The Security Service's job is to ensure that our new status quo holds, and that this city thrives away from Hippogriff control."
WIN_hippogriff_volunteers:0 "The Hippogriff Volunteer Department"
WIN_hippogriff_volunteers_desc:0 "Now that our government has settled in, and the immediate threat of armed rebellion has passed, we have decided it is time to begin recruiting select locals into our police force and military. While foreigners will still make up the bulk of our forces, we can supplement them with hippogriffs just to make up the slack."

WIN_commission_a_fleet:0 "Commission the Fleet"
WIN_commission_a_fleet_desc:0 ""
WIN_underwater_antipartisan_operations:0 "Submarine Anti-Partisan Operations"
WIN_underwater_antipartisan_operations_desc:0 "Roughly half of the Legation's de jure territory lies beneath the water's surface. It's inhabitents are seaponies, the "other half" of the Hippogriffian realm and it has presented a... unique issue for our administration. None of the three species holding guard over the Legation can breathe underwater, meaning we are having to resort to... unique methods to halt resistance to our rule in this territory."
WIN_the_joint_marine_force:0 "The Winggarden Marine Corps"
WIN_the_joint_marine_force_desc:0 ""
WIN_build_up_shipyards:0 "Fund the Shipyards"
WIN_build_up_shipyards_desc:0 ""

WIN_the_tram_system:0 "Modernise the Tram System"
WIN_the_tram_system_desc:0 "Wingarden already has an extensive tram system, even if it has not aged with grace. The combined resources of our benefactors, however, means that we will be able to court the services of some of the world's finest engineers, and in time we can make this tram system the most modern in the world!"
WIN_the_development_bank:0 "The Winggarden Development Fund"
WIN_the_development_bank_desc:0 "Despite our benefactors' differences, all are interested in seeing Winggarden prosper. Consolidating the resources we've acquired since the 12 concessions, we will be able to build up a new bank to specifically help with the development of the city."
WIN_colthaginian_companies:0 "Invite Colthaginian Companies"
WIN_colthaginian_companies_desc:0 "Our Colthaginian benefactors are an economic powerhouse. It would not take much to ensure that their conglomerates can install themselves in Winggarden, increasing their influence and our industrial capacity both."
WIN_AGWP_investments:0 "AGWP Contracts"
WIN_AGWP_investments_desc:0 "The Wingbardian delegate has been in contact with one of the premier Wingbardian petrochemical companies, and they've signalled their interest in establishing themselves in the city. Not only would it mean Winggarden becomes the center of a world-class oil refinery, it would also be a fine feather in representative Gappi's hat."
WIN_develop_the_arsenal:0 "The Winggarden Arsenal"
WIN_develop_the_arsenal_desc:0 "Prosperity begets envy, and if Winggarden is to ensure that the prosperity built up within her city limits remains in her hooves, she must be ready to defend it. None has questioned this particular point, and for once the three representatives put equal enthusiasm into arraging for Winggarden's military industrial complex to grow."
WIN_setup_chiropterran_homes:0 "Chiropterran Military Towns"
WIN_setup_chiropterran_homes_desc:0 "Ocean Spray has argued quite fervently for the adoption of the Chiropterran system of military towns. While it would put certain quarters of the city beyond the other representatives' grasp, it would also, undoubtedly, help to fortify Winggarden in case of an attack."
WIN_seize_hippogriff_companies:0 "Nationalise Hippogriff Companies"
WIN_seize_hippogriff_companies_desc:0 "The local Hippogriff companies are a security risk, one that must be dealt with. While they've by and large played by the rules set forth, they are obvious vectors for the Hippogriffs to attempt to reassert themselves, or at least introduce spies into the city. It'll cause a stir, but they should be nationalized and placed under our control."
WIN_import_experts:0 "Invite Financial Experts"
WIN_import_experts_desc:0 "Many times, the sound advice of financial experts will get hampered by political necessity, but thankfully Winggarden offers more freedom than that. Our far-reaching control along with our sound business laws mean that economic reforms will not only be tolerable, but welcome. It's time we let the world's top financial minds know this."
WIN_the_city_on_the_hill:0 "The City On A Hill"
WIN_the_city_on_the_hill_desc:0 "Winggarden has become something something rarely seen before in this world; a place where competition can reign supreme. Whether competition between our representatives, benefactors, companies or citizens, we all stand tall upon the hill where we built our paradise, and all will scratch and claw their way up that hill for a chance to partake in the prosperity that is the rightful reward of the victors." 
WIN_develop_fuel_stores:0 "The Legation Municipal Fuel Reserve"
WIN_develop_fuel_stores_desc:0 "The ever belligerent Ocean Spray has lobbied quite fervently for the creation of a municipal fuel reserve, arguing that if we are cut off from our trade partners we must be able to rely on our own fuel reserves. This 'dagger to our necks' must be addressed he insists, and of course the fact that it will advance his own goals is surely merely a coincidence." 
WIN_develop_steel_milling:0 "Develop Steel Milling"
WIN_develop_steel_milling_desc:0 "The number one metal of the modern world is not gold or silver, but steel, and Winggarden has the potential to master this metal as well as well. Negotiations with foreign steel companies have already begun, and we have half a dozen companies eagerly bidding for place in the new industrial park designated for the purpose."
WIN_high_rises:0 "The Mile High Club"
WIN_high_rises_desc:0 "Winggarden is a small place, and real estate is hard to come by. The solition is simple; build upwards! Winggarden will become a mountain range of high-rises reaching up against the sky, and in this we will become the very image of the future city, even if we have to expropriate some locals' residences to achieve it."

WIN_the_legaiton_secured:0 "The Free City"
WIN_the_legaiton_secured_desc:0 "The great game of dominance in Winggarden has come to an end not with a bang, but by grinding to a halt. The Legation bureaucracy has crystallized to the point where neither player can subvert it, and Winggarden faces a future that neither of its founders could envision: a future of freedom."
WIN_the_biggest_port:0 "The Staple Port Of Zebrica"
WIN_the_biggest_port_desc:0 "Winggarden can be the gateway to Zebrica, if she only has the space for it. With further expansions of the harbor, our tonnage capacity will be unrivalled. The future looks bright, after all, and we need to prepare for it."
WIN_underwater_hotels:0 "Vertical Development"
WIN_underwater_hotels_desc:0 "Space remains a luxury in our city, and we have already built upwards. It is time to learn from the Hippogriffs and build downwards, into the ocean. Imagine! Hotels and resturants - an entire tourist complex - situated under the waves, with the beautiful bottom of the sea for a view!"
WIN_naval_aviation_department:0 "The Winggarden Naval Aviation Department"
WIN_naval_aviation_department_desc:0 "As part of our efforts to secure the trading lanes for both us and for our trading partners, Winggarden has acquired a large amount of long distance naval bombers which will let us protect and intervene along the lanes wherever needed."
WIN_legation_mechanisation:0 "Legation Mechanisation"
WIN_legation_mechanisation_desc:0 "The most technologically advanced city in the world should have a military to match. Instead of slogging along by hoof, our soldiers will be able to arrive on the scene in moments, mounted in armored vehicles and striking faster than their enemies can react.."
WIN_expand_volunteer_forces:0 "Unite the Volunteer Departments"
WIN_expand_volunteer_forces_desc:0 "Thanks to the legates' bickering, the myriad foreign volunteers have been organized in different, sometimes competing formations. It's a mess, but thankfully we are now in a position where we can try to unravel this twisty knot."
WIN_expand_the_council:0 "Open Up the Council"
WIN_expand_the_council_desc:0 "With the great game no longer being carried out in the halls of power, the time has come to open them to the Hippogriffs as well. There's no point in alienating the local elites, not when they are our neighbors and competitors."
WIN_permit_gatherings:0 "Permit Public Gatherings"
WIN_permit_gatherings_desc:0 "Instability and resentment is bad for business, and this suppression of the marketplace of ideas has gone on for long enough. Let the people have their voice, otherwise they will be out protesting in the streets."
WIN_council_of_corportations:0 "The Corporate Council"
WIN_council_of_corportations_desc:0 "Winggarden exists as a place for commerce and ambition, and in order to ensure these values never are threatened, we will ensure that the major economic powerhouses of our city are well represented in the government."
WIN_allow_political_parties:0 "Into The Shadows"
WIN_allow_political_parties_desc:0 "The power of the legates isn't going anywhere, it's just changing form. The recent unrest meant that reform was needed, but the power is simply moving into the shadows, from which Winggarden's original purpose can still be carried out, only in a more palatable form."
WIN_renegotiate_concessions:0 "Negotiate With the Hippogriffs"
WIN_renegotiate_concessions_desc:0 "Hippogriffia is still resenting the loss of Winggarden. This resentment will not magically vanish, but maybe we can offer them a deal? Giving them a seat a the table and a share in the profits will alleviate their economic woes, and if they in return acknowledge us... well it's the best deal possible, isn't it?"
WIN_further_urban_development:0 "Sky High"
WIN_further_urban_development_desc:0 "We're building higher and higher, and it seems like every day the tallest building in the city changes. This is our pride and joy, our finest monument to Winggarden's prosperity. Redirect plane traffic, reform the building codes to ensure proper safety, restrict personal flight to the boulevards, for Winggarden is growing!"
WIN_rubber_development:0 "The Winggarden Rubber Plant"
WIN_rubber_development_desc:0 "One of Winggarden's strengths is its openness to foreign business, and the newfound stability has brought investors both new and old to our shores. Among these, rubber is one of the hot new commodities. If Wingarden corners the market on synthetic rubber, we will have a product everyone will need."
WIN_legation_CAS:0 "The Legation Bomber Fleet"
WIN_legation_CAS_desc:0 "Winggarden's metropolitan landscape makes it tricky for airplanes to find their targets in case of an attack, but more easily manouvered light bombers or attack planes can manouvre around the skyscrapers if need be, and the boulevards can serve as runways if needed."
WIN_rocketry_development:0 "Changeling Ingenuity"
WIN_rocketry_development_desc:0 "We are a city that welcomes the ambitious, and the Changelings are no exception. It's strange how few are giving them a chance, but their loss is our gain, especially when some of these changeling expatriates turn out to be rocket scientists."
WIN_just_like_pegas:0 "The Las Pegasus Of Zebrica"
WIN_just_like_pegas_desc:0 "Winggarden is a centre of commerce, but its entertainment industry is booming as well. The trade will flow either way, so maybe it would behoove us to focus on making sure that all of north Zebrica knows that Winggarden is the place to come to for a good time?"
WIN_just_like_skyfall:0 "The Skyfall Of Zebrica"
WIN_just_like_skyfall_desc:0 "Any merchant worth their salt knows how Skyfall has become a cliché when speaking of a successful business centre. We can at least aim to spare Zebrica from the constant nattering about Skyfall, and we shall do so by supplanting it as the heart of international commerce across north Zebrica."
WIN_the_atomic_age:0 "The Age Of the Atom"
WIN_the_atomic_age_desc:0 "The new frontier of scientific development is in the atom, and the applications for this new technology are countless. And after all, what is Winggarden if not a haven for the experimental and the modern? Time to start experimenting on atomic level as well."

legation.4.d:0 "Deep within the tunnels below Winggarden, a group of military officers runs down a dimly lit hallway. Once one of the city's defensive redoubts against invasion, this tunnel network now serves as the paths by which the Legation military quickly moves about the city. And storming down corridor 3c, with papers in hoof, comes generals Marble Pillar and Sonar Beep. Inbound on room 14, also known as "The Nightmare Chamber," the office of Ocean Spray.\n\nEntering the room with a slam of the door, the figures already in the room turn to face them. Generals Zaladid and Gevese had already arrived and were speaking with Ocean Spray, after a couple of quick salutes the Chiropterrans place down the papers they'd been holding. Detailed maps of what was going on in the city. For the first time in the Legation's history, there was an organized mass protest on the streets. The shock of losing the war had kept the Hippogriffs tame for a while, but now they were back and angry.\n\nGeneral Pillar began, "They've occupied some of the main boulevards, the port, and the plaza around city hall. Gilippo is under siege in there and needs to be relieved. We've been preparing for this day for a while now, and we need to act fast. His guards can only hold out so long. I, for one, favor a strike operation to get him out, followed by a conventional surround tactic up Lunar Road and starving the protest out. They'll back down eventually. Zaladid then spoke up, "These protesters will be at our necks if we let them stay around any longer. We need to march a single column up the street, and they will part and let us through to Gappi. Or we will make them."\n\nThe commanders debated for a minute, not quite coming to a consensus before Ocean Spray himself lifted a hoof, "Gentlecreatures, the solution here is simple. A few days ago, I received a personal gift from my Lady Commander Emerald Light, which we can use to sort out this issue nice and quick." The commanders around Spray leaned in, intrigued what the Chiropterran representative had received. "We have been blessed by the Nightmare," Spray triumphantly declared, "with a shipment of methylphosphonofluoridate."\n\nThe generals stood for a moment, unsure what Ocean Spray meant. Reading the room, he explained, "Also known as sarin gas." At this, the room exploded, general Gevese spit out the coffee and began to curse wildly in his native tongue. Zaladid slammed his hoof on the desk and exclaimed, "Are you insane! Are you recommending we unleash a nerve agent on the population of the city! In the middle of the government district!" "By the Nightmare, I am general!" Spray responded. As their voices rose, a crack shot up in the air as general Sonar Beep fired a blank out of his pistol into the air. "Representative Spray! You are not a military officer, the use of sarin gas on the population will not be authorized. Though if I remember, you also received tear gas in that shipment. Something much more appropriate for the situation. We must act fast, I move we authorize the police to use this tear gas to disperse the protestors, and then we move in to get Gappi out of there. All in favor?"\n\nAll in the room besides Spray raised their hooves and claws. "Passed. Now let's get moving.""

legation.5.t:0 "On Patrol"
legation.5.d:0 "The two massive police officers - one griffon and one thestral - slowly strode down the street, both of them clad in heavy combat armor and carrying massive twelve milimeter rifles. Neither of them seemed overly encumbered by it either, and as they approached, hippogriffs, ponies and zebras all got out of the way in fear. The street market had been bustling, but now it was near empty, with only the occasional stall owners trying desperately to pack their wares up and step out of the way. One of the stall owners dropped a box of fruits, one of them rolling over the pavement and coming to a stop right in front of the leading griffon, who stopped and stared the shall owner down before picking up the orange.\n\n"Your papers, citizen?" the griffon asked, his voice rumbling inside the massive armor. The hippogriff backed away in fear at first, but the sight of the massive weapons made him dismiss any thought of fleeing, and he slowly walked behind the stall and took out his papers, which the thestral took and looked over, putting the orange back in the box.\n\n"These permits are due for renewal," the thestral informed him, the hippogriff stammering out an apology before being cut off. "Also, while you apply, make sure to ask for a AV-11 permit regarding fresh fruit, it was only signed into law a week ago, and may have missed it."\n\n"I-um... yes..." the Hippogriff began, trailing off.\n\n"Make sure to inform your fellow salescreatures of this as well," the griffon told him, "This market has done a lot of good for the local community, and it would be a shame to see it closed down. We will be patrolling here regularly, so do not hesitate to ask us if you have any questions. We are based at 5th Claw and Beak, and all relevant forms can be found there. Is there anything else you need, citizen?"\n\n"I don't think so?" the hippogriff didn't know what to think of this entire thing. The two officers simply nodded in response.\n\n"Good day, citizen," the thestral said as they began down the street again, leaving the market goers and stall owners to peek out from their hiding spots after the pair."
legation.5.a:0 "That was unexpected... but why the anti-tank rifles?"

legation.6.t:0 "Special Winggarden Assault Teams"
legation.6.d:0 ""You are the hammer that will crush all that stand before the legation authorities!" The thestral thundered as he walked back and forth in front of the black-clothed, heavily armored police officers, "Like a dagger, you will cut to the very heart of those who stand defiant, wreaking such havoc that-"\n\nBAP! his voice was cut off as the baton hit his leg and he gasped in pain, clutching his leg as he hobbled to the side, revealing the police chief that had come up behind him.\n\n"What he MEANT TO SAY..." the police chief said patiently, glaring at the police captain as he nursed his bruised leg, "Is that as part of our policing strategy, we aim to keep the regular officers for regular police work, and deploy the elite - you - for situations that exceed their capacities. Hostage situations, armed robberies, crazed mages, and so forth." The captain had recovered by now and came up to continue.\n\n"And to this end, you must be ready to wreak the ultimate violence upon all that stand before you. Give neither quarter nor mercy, for-"BAP!\n\n"He MEANS that you must above all else be disciplined and predictable in the field. Those who resist must be subdued, those who use lethal force must be neutralized, those who comply must be safe. There cannot be any doubt among the citizenry about what will lead to what. If they play along, they are safe, if they don't, they will be dealt with."\n\n"And above all else!" The captain began again, "Remember that you are instruments of vengeance-"BAP!\n\n"Of law and order..." the chief sighed. "When you are deployed, you are still police officers, and a successful deployment will not only deal with the issue at hoof, but it will also impress the population and show them just how capable the WPD is. This will inspire confidence, and confidence in the police will-"BAP! The captain had barely even opened his mouth this time. "-lead to trust. Each and every one here will have the highest standards placed on them for that reason. The eyes of the world will be upon you, and if we do well, we will be the vanguard of a new era. Good luck, officers.""

legation.14.d:0 "Effective law enforcement was built on trust, both between officer and citizen, and between officers. A key part of the latter was faith in your superiors. If you didn't trust them, you still had to carry out their orders, and the best thing an officer could do was to believe, and to trust.\n\nCaptain Galbo reminded himself of this again and again as the furious banging on the walls of his submarine began once more. Twelve years in the Wingbardian navy, several commendations and a chance to serve abroad in Zebrica, and yet this was where he had ended up?\n\n"Deploy the divers," he ordered quietly, and one of his officers moved as fast as she could over the by now padded floors and towards the diving lock, where she silently gave a signal to the six officers who had spent eight hours inside their wetsuits, waiting for this moment. Closing the hatch, they silently filled it with water from the ballast tanks so that it would not be noticed from the outside, and the officers all quietly put the masks over their faces, using the new Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatuses to be able to breathe even as the lock filled with water.\n\nWhen the airlock finally opened, his divers shot out of it as fast as their artificial fins could propel them, out at the seaponies that had clustered around the submarine to vandalize it, as they did every time. Not this time though, with their new gear, his officers would be almost as fast as the seaponies.\n\nOr they would be, if the seaponies had not come prepared with nets, and all his officers had for their rapid deployment was swimming straight into the nets like panicked fishes. With the seaponies descending on them, tearing off their fins and covering them in sea life, all Captain Galbo was left with was four humiliated officers coming back through the diving lock covered in starfishes and clams just as the knockinfg began again."

legation.20.d:0 "As the great game continues between the three legates, tension has been building steadily throughout Winggarden. Winggarden has had no shortage of ambitious and dedicated creatures to fill the ranks beneath the legates, yet when the ones meant to be their superiors kept squabbling instead of governing, it wasn't long before people began to whisper. Calling it a conspiracy might be far-fetched, it was more like a series of changes throughout each of their organizations. Officials were no longer personally loyal to the legates, but instead their respective departments, and the big three's bickering became more and more of a hassle that needed to be dealt with. Thus, bit by bit, the great game found itself grinding to a halt, and by the time the legates realized what had happened it was too late.\n\nThere was no insurrection and no drama, just a sudden realization for all of them that their respective offices no longer supported them. And what were they meant to do? Call their respective homelands and say that theír subordinates weren't being obedient? At best, they'd get laughed at, at worst they'd cause an international incident as any foreign meddling would lead to the other parties intervening.\n\nThus, only a slow surrender was left for them, and they all handled it differently. Gappi slowly resigned himself to his fate and took a week off work. Ocean Spray barricaded himself in his office and and screamed through the window that they would all pay for this for several hours, until a squad of soldiers kicked the door down and forcibly escorted him home to cool off. In contrast though, Zahummid had not only taken the news well but seemed outright overjoyed, at least if his enthusiastic treating of the office to his personal liquor and cigarres are  any indication.\n\nWith the legates either sidelined or persuaded, a new dawn is rising for Winggarden, a Winggarden that has managed to rise to stand on her own four legs!"
legation.20.a:0 "Let the good times roll!"

legation.21.t:0 "The New Legation Council"
legation.21.d:0 ""Do we need to get you a glass of water?" Azizelqart asked patiently as he looked at Ocean Spray, who seemed about to have an aneurysm. When the Chiropterran legate didn't answer, he simply looked to Gilippo, who at least could talk. "You were saying?"\n\n"I... have been in contact with some of the hippogriff business leaders," the Wingbardian sighed, looking as though somecreature had sucked out his soul. "They have reacted well to the proposal, and they're planning to put forth a candidate to serve on the Legation Council."\n\n"Fantastic!" Azizelqart said enthusiastically, taking his mug of tea and sipping from it. "It's Golden Shore, isn't it?" he added as he was done, Gappi nodding.\n\n"It is, so thank Boreas for small blessings, at least."\n\n"What blessing is there even to be had here?!" Ocean Spray suddenly snapped, Azizelqart thinking to himself that the name was really fitting, considering how much the Chiropterran spat when he screamed. "Are you both utterly insane?! Why are we even entertaining this?! We should each be requesting aid from our homelands to crush this whole insurrection! But no, suddenly we are capitulating to the natives?!"\n\n"And I thought a military pony like you would understand the necessity of reform," Azizelqart commented airily. "Our purpose is to make sure money flows from Winggarden. If political liberalization helps in that, then why not?"\n\n"If giving control to the creatures we conquered helps to maintain it?" Ocean Spray asked. "Are you insane! Do you seriously think making a hippogriff a legate will aid in anything?"\n\n"We're not making one a delegate, we're making one a president." Azizelqart replied mildly, watching as Ocean Spray seemed to swallow his tongue in disbelief."
legation.21.a:0 "It is a necessary shakeup."

legation.22.t:0 "A New Winggardian Democracy"
legation.22.d:0 ""And as we move forward towards a brighter future, I want to ask you all, my fellow citizens, what future this should be?!" Golden Shore asked as he stood before the crowd. "This beautiful city would never have risen this far without us, my fellow Hippogriffs. Our dilligence and our hard work is the bedrock of Winggarden, and we are building towards a future where every hippogriff will be the queen or king of this city, free and more prosperous than we ever could have imagined! I believe in a united and prosperous Winggarden: will you all continue to build with me?!" he asked, the crowd cheering enthusiastically.\n\nComing off the stage, he smiled widely as he shook claws with the people he just had addressed, listening idly to their concerns and giving them comforting little words. As he spotted the journalists with their cameras, he leaned in to one of the females that had come up to him, poking the little chick she was carrying with her in the stomach.\n\n"Well aren't you the cutest little thing?" he said merrily, "What can such a fine little boy be called, then?"\n\nAs the mother told him the name he made an affirmative noise and made sure the cameras caught him playing with the fuzzy little thing. "A fine name indeed. I hope we'll both be able to continue working for his future as well!" He said, drawing enthusiastic cheers from the hippogriffs around him. Still, he made sure to keep some distance from the fuzzball in case it decided to puke or something."
legation.22.a:0 "The plan progresses well"

legation.23.t:0 "A New Dawn"
legation.23.d:0 "Golden Shore smiled widely as he shook the legates' hooves - claw in Gilippo's case - and made sure to let the cameras capture him from his best side. It had been a stunning victory for him - of course it had - and he waved to the crowds gathered in front of the legates' office - now the presidential residence - to watch his inauguration. With one claw raised, he put his hand on the law book and solemnly swore the presidential oath. He couldn't quite stop smiling, especially not as the sash was placed across his chest, and as he greeted the crowd, the smile was near blinding.\n\n"Today is a new day for Winggarden!" he said loudly, "My fellow Winggardians, how proud can we not all be this day?! Today, we have taken a great step towards making Winggarden, and Winggarden only, the shining city on the hill that we all know that she can be!"\n\nAs he spoke, Azizelqart sat in the background, smiling politely as he envisioned the string-pull on Golden Shore's back. Mentally, he reached out and imagined pulling it, and he had to stop his grin as Golden Shore's topic switched as if on a cue.\n\n"And I tell you all, my fellow Winggardians, that we are not done yet, and that we must continue to fight to ensure that the brave new world that has arisen in this city can remain an inspiration to all! Whatever was, we are Winggardians now, no less and no more, for what more could any creature ask for, than to be part of this great project? I swear to you, my fellow citizens, that I will not let Winggarden be threatened by anyone! Together, we will prevail, we will remain prosperous, and we will remain the envy of the world!"\n\nAzizelqart nodded to himself. Golden Shore really had been a good investment."    
legation.23.a:0 "Hurray for Democracy."

legation.24.t:0 "The Proposal"
legation.24.d:0 "After we lost Winggarden the city transformed immensely, becoming a hub of economic exploitation for our enemies. While we have worked to recover, they have grown fat from the wealth that flows from the city. With this in mind, the fact that recently, the city elected its own president and has moved to distance itself from its old captors, comes as a shock. The new "president" of Winggarden, a hippogriff named Golden Shore, has contacted us with an offer of rapproachment.\n\nThe offer would let us access the Winggardian markets and enjoy the wealth that had built up there - something we sorely lack after recent events, yet in doing so we would not only give up our claim on the city, but we would also need to surrender the surrounding countryside to it. The area in question would serve as in part a buffer zone, but also to ensure Winggarden, and thus the wealth it would provide us, can continue to grow.\n\nThe city is still under Chiropterran, Wingbardian and Colthaginian control, and our prospects of retaking it by force is slim to say the least. This, at least, would give us something for all the pain, but can we truly give up the city?"
legation.24.a:0 "I suppose it is accpetable"
legation.24.b:0 "Not a damn chance! Winggarden is Hippogriffia!"

legation.25.t:0 "The Winggarden Concordant"
legation.25.d:0 "Rising up out of his seat, Golden Shore pushed the button on his desk and called for his secretary to bring in his champagne before he walked around the desk and gave the ambassador a hearty hug.\n\n"A fantastic choice, my friend!" he said as he wrapped one arm over the ambassador's shoulders and walked towards the window with him. "You will not regret this, I can assure you of that! Hippogriffia is stepping into the future, to become one more claw holding the ladle that stirs the great melting pot!"\n\n"Yes, it will be reassuring for everyone that we are finally normalizing relations," the Ambassador said evenly, seeming more than a little uncomfortable. "We all hope that this will help us build towards a better future..."\n\nOh it will, it most certainly will!" Golden Shore exclaimed with a wide, slick smile. "And if nothing else..." he said, leaning in a bit conspiratorially. "You can not imagine how much this will enrage a certain Chiropterran legate," he whispered, clucking happily as he patted the hippogriff on the shoulder."  
legation.25.a:0 "Our freedom is secured!"

legation.26.t:0 "The Concordant Rejected"
legation.26.d:0 "Well that certainly wasn't a good showing for the new president," Gilippo commented as he leaned back on the chair and read the newspaper, whose front page was plastered with the news that Hippogriffia had refused the offer of rapproachment.\n\n"Thank the moon for small mercies, at least," Ocean Spray commented with a scoff, "also, why are you two pestering me at breakfast of all times?"\n\n"Because you have a nice taste in cafés if nothing else," Azizelqart responded from across the table before taking a bite out of the daisy sandwich. he really hadn't known what to think of this Equestrian-style sandwich at first, but he had decided he liked it. "But as much of a shame as it is, it won't matter too much in the long run. Hippogriffia decided to place national pride before cutting their losses and improving the economy."\n\n"At least Golden Shore made the effort," Gilippo commented, "and the locals will remember that. They really do have good food here though," he added to Ocean Spray. Instead of responding, Ocean Spray silently downed his coffee, fantasizing about pouring it over them."

While the nations that came together to force this concession upon the §RHippogriffs§! were all happy to cooperate in the times of war, now that peace has come, things are a bit more complicated. §OWingbardy§!, §CChiropterra§!, and §gColthage§! all have conflicting interests within the legation. The griffons try to secure their economic interests, while the Chiropterrans and zebras both seek to ensure that §RHippogriffia§! is kept nice and subserviant.

### Advisors ###
WIN_advisor_1:0 "Gilippo Gappi"
WIN_advisor_1_desc:0 "If there is one creature within Winggarden that could be said to embody what the Legation means for the nations involved, it would be Gilippo Gappi. Once just a minor diplomat in Wingbardy's foreign service, Gappi played an immense role in getting the griffons to seize the chance offered by the Colthaginian and Chiropterran invasion of the Hippogriffs' continental mandate, seeing tremendous economic opportunity in the venture. He had known these lands for years before entering the diplomatic service, serving in the seas around Zebrica as a member of the Wingbardian Navy and Air Force, where he pioneered airship technology and added much of Zebrica to Wingbardian maps. So when Wingbardy needed a diplomat to head their new involvements in Zebrica, Gilippo's application was readily accepted, and he was sent once again to Zebrica to work out treaties with Wingbardy's new allies on the continent. Gilippo was also the griffon who sat at the negotiating table with the Hippogriffs and placed before them the now-infamous Twelve Concessions. With the Legation being a concession of his own inception. An international zone jointly ruled by the three nations.\n\nBut this is where Gappi faltered. He believed that the legation would be able to exist in perpetual peace. But now, with the reality of the Legation's situation clear to him, he has joined in its great game to ensure the interests of his nation come out on top.\n\n§OViva il Re e viva alla nazione!§!\n\n"
WIN_advisor_2:0 "Ocean Spray"
WIN_advisor_2_desc:0 "Ocean Spray was born to a couple of Silver Moon Legion Soldiers forty-four years ago, entering the service as quickly as he could, he slowly began to climb the Legion's ranks, but not in the way most did. He was not a military bat, but a pencil-pushing bureaucrat, though one adept at his job. In his early thirties, he signed up for the LMRD, serving to organize and structure their less savory business into a form more palatable by the rest of the Legions. This work gained him the attention of Emerald Light, who marked the Bat down for a higher position at a later time. That time came at Chiropterra's triumph over the Hippogriffs, when it and its allies established Winggarden. While the Council of Legions was looking for a bat to send, Emerald put Ocean Spray forth. He was competent, pious, and seemed like a good choice. But he was also personally loyal to his Silver Moon legion, a detail Commander Light was sure to leave out.\n\nPersonally, Spray is no kind soul. He is a harsh bat, and is only a bit nicer to his friends than enemies and only has a few hobbies. He holds a general disdain for the hippogriff and seapony populations, and is always preparing for a struggle against them. He often chides against his fellow representatives, continually wishing to assure his control over the Legation military, sometimes even against the other Chiropterran commanders' advice. Many question why someone as un-charasmatic as him was placed as the Chiropterran representative.\n\nSecretly though, this is all part of Chiropterra's place in the great game of Winggarden. Once a month Ocean Spray receives two letters. One from the Legionary Council and Warmaster [BAT.getleader], his "official" orders, and another delievered to him secretly, Operation Nightlight, Winggarden's place in Lunar dominance of Zebrica, and then, further beyond.\n\n§CHe serves Her Imperial Majesty, Nightmare Moon, and the Silver Legion above all other things, and he will not betray his duty.\n\n"
WIN_advisor_3:0 "Azizelqart Zahummid"
WIN_advisor_3_desc:0 "Azizelqart Zahummid is a name most in Colthage will know, but they can't tell you much about him. His whole life, he has been an economist working in the back rooms of Colthaginian government to guide its ship of state. A member of Zamilcar Zarca's favored Scientific Clique, he fled with Zalathel when the Storm King arrived and served in his cabinet when he reestablished his rule over Colthage, earning him a high place in the economics ministry. In this regard, many would be content to stop there, sit on their rear end, and make a happy and healthy living. And Azizelqart was content for a long time, until he read Gappi's documents regarding the opportunities in establishing the Legation. It made something burn deep within him, an opportunity to try his economic theories in a land where he had near-total control of the economic sphere. So, he drafted his proposal to Zalathel and submitted it, requesting the spot as Colthage's representative in the Legation, and promising great things should his efforts be supported. And so he was sent to Winggarden with a blank cheque. To do as he sees fit, and to bring prosperity to Colthage.\n\n§gFor the good of all its citizens.§!\n\n"

He holds a general disdain for the hippogriff and seapony populations, and is always preparing for a struggle against them.\n\nBut now he has hit a new height. The Warmaster now sends him new orders. No longer is the plan to be careful subversion and maintaining control, now it shall only be absolute domination. Ocean Spray has seized his chance and has upended Chiropterran policy in Hippogriffia. He intends to use his position for the good of the nation and aim a "Dagger at Mount Aris" as he regularly says to his assistants.\n\nOcean Spray is in control of Winggarden now. And Nightmare help any creature who stands in his way."
WIN_AZIZELQUART_ZAHUMIND_DESC:0 "Azizelqart Zahummid is a name most in Colthage will know, but they can't tell you much about him. His whole life, he has been an economist working in the back rooms of Colthaginian government to guide its ship of state, and now the guardian of a new nation, the Colthago Nuovo Project. A member of Zamilcar Zarca's favored Scientific Clique, he fled with Zalathel when the Storm King arrived and served in his cabinet when he reestablished his rule over Colthage, earning him a high place in the economics ministry. In this regard, many would be content to stop there, sit on their rear end, and make a happy and healthy living. And Azizelqart was content for a long time, until he read Gappi's documents regarding the opportunities in establishing the Legation. It made something burn deep within him, an opportunity to try his economic theories in a land where he had near-total control of the economic sphere. He just never expected to be leading it. After the fall of the Legation, Zahummid has done his best to save many aspects of the previous system. And with this, he has had even more freedom to implement his economic ideas. He has declared that his Colthago Nuovo will be a bastion of free market economics, proving that a nation can run itself off of the power of capital alone. But only time will show if he can succeed."
