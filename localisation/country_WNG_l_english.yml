 WNG_garibald_talonuel_iii_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 11th November 940, Karthin, Wingbardy.\n\n§YBiography§!: Known as the 'Soldier King' due to his leadership during the Falcor War, Garibald Talonuel III is well respected and beloved by the Wingbardian griffons. In 972 ALB his father, King Gumberto, was murdered in the Imperial Palace in Griffenheim while attending a party for the young Grover V. The newly crowned Garibald demanded justice but was given none. In protest he severed all ties with the Empire, declaring Wingbardy to be independent for the first time in in over over a century. The rest of the empire soon took Wingbardy's lead, quickly leading to the Empire's collapse.\n\nThe first few years of independence was prosperous for Wingbardy, however a border dispute with Falcor in 985 lead to four long and bloody years of conflict that scarred Wingbardy to this day. During the war, King Garibald Talonuel III was known to often visit the frontline and had significant support among his troops.\n\nHowever, the years since the war have only seen Wingbardy's situation grown worse. Failed government after failed government, along with a crippled economy, has lead to many Wingbardians demanding that he step in and find a way to resolve their situation. WIth the rise of Fascism and Communism, it became clear that only he could decide Wingbardy's future.\n\nHe sees his son, Gumberto, as a disappointment and secretly fears for the future of the monarchy unless his son can better himself. In the King's free time he is an avid stamp collector. His collection of postal stamps is the largest in the world.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Sinister"

 WNG_wingbardian_stalliongrad_treaty:0 "Wingbardian - Stalliongrad Treaty"
 WNG_wingbardian_stalliongrad_treaty_desc:0 "Stalliongrad is a curious entity. Though they are in many ways the opposite to us, necessity makes for strange bedfellows.

 WNG_legitimise_the_blackwings_desc:0 "Beakolini's paramilitary organisation has been key to his political ambitions, and their loyalty to him above all other things is too valuable for the Duce to let go of.

 WNG_the_gacerbo_law_desc:0 "Beakolini has achieved several of his goals, but the parliament keeps stymying his efforts. To counter this, he has motioned for a parliamentary reform, one that will tip the balance of the scales.

 WNG_accountable_only_to_the_king_desc:0 "All that Beakolini has done has one purpose and one purpose only: the prosperity and glory of Wingbardy. All other things are vestigal issues that cannot be allowed to stand in his way. That is why he will be beholden to the king only.

 WNG_the_grand_council_of_fascism_desc:0 "The bickering politicians almost brought Wingbardy to ruin, but that doesn't mean that the entire system is wholly rotten.

 WNG_beakolinis_education_reform:0 "Beakolini's Education Reform"
 WNG_beakolinis_education_reform_desc:0 "If Wingbardy is to prosper, she must ensure that her children are given a good education both physically and mentally.

 WNG_fix_the_resource_deficit_desc:0 "It is not that Wingbardy lacks resources, it is that too much of it is wasted, whether on frivolous civilian projects or exports. Still, if we truly commit to it, autarky will be within our reach."

Ever since the murder of his father in 971, Garibald Talonuel has led Wingbardy through times of both triumph and hardship. He was instrumental in the collapse of the Griffonian Empire, protected the south from Imperial aggression and united the nation through the long and bloody war with Falcor. Garibald Talonuel was also a prolific coin collector with over 100,000 coins in his private collection, each of them personally documented and studied. He left his collection to the National Karthinian Museum for all Wingbardians to enjoy.\n\nThe throne now passes to his son Prince Gumberto, who is a mere shadow of his father.

La Marcia Reale d'Ordinanza has been the national anthem for close to 100 years, but ever since Beakolini and his Fascist took power their own anthem, Giovinezza, has (often forcefully) supplanted it. Those loyal to the King see this as a great betrayal of Wingbardian tradition, but the King has remained silent on the issue. There is now a debate in parliament on whether la Marcia Reale d'Ordinanza should be officially replaced by Giovinezza as the official national anthem of the nation.\n\nIt is expected to go the Blackshirt's way, after all, la Marcia Reale d'Ordinanza has no official lyrics while Giovinezza has such wonderful verses as \"With a Wingbardian's pride swear fealty to Beakolini\". This mandatory anthem is merely the griffons showing how much they love Il Duce. \n\nUnlike his father, Prince Gumberto has not remained silent on the issue. He has instead proposed La Leggenda del Piumave as a compromise. The popular song dates to the Falcor War and tales of the flooding of the river Piumave, halting Falcor's invasion of Wingbardy shortly after the disastrous battle at Clawporetto and how it allowed the Regio Esercito time to launch the counter attack required to push Falcor back and to final victory at the battle of Garibald Gergamo.\n\nWith the debate being held, who will carry the day?"

 wingbardy.144.t:0 "The Gattei Way"
 wingbardy.144.d:0 "The foundation of the AGWP has not been an easy affair. Due to the poor economic situation of the kingdom, the project was originally underfunded. The original chairgriffon put in charge of the operation quickly departed for fear he was set up for failure or worse. In his stead emerged Genrico Gattei. Gattei was known as a rather crafty industrialist in Taloncana. Some of his ventures were impacted but instead of abandoning them like some others when the AGWP was created, he embraced it and began to lobby the government over participation in it. After all within the government began to see the position as doomed to fail, it was awarded to Gattei.\n\nUnder Gattei's leadership, the company was reorganised more efficiently along less bureaucratic lines. However, the budget of the AGWP was still an issue. Gattei's answer to it was the Taloncana scheme. With much fanfare and press coverage, he announced that incredibly rich methane and oil deposits were found in Taloncana and that soon, Wingbardy would become oil-independent. This quickly rose confidence in the company and many rich Wingbardians and capitalists began to buy into it, providing the company with some much-needed cash.\n\nThe reality was a bit less fantastic. Oil deposits were indeed found but they were very poor compared to the methane reserves. What he did was using natural gas instead to boost the development of national industry in the region. The gas would be a cheaper and more functional substitute for the all-important coal imported at great expenses. As many of these industry belonged to Gattei's family or friends, he benefited highly from the move. This could have been one of the greatest scandal in Wingbardian history but the move ultimately lead to a boom in the region and the high profits were plowed back into the various branches of the AGWP, allowing to grow even more and strike actual oil deposits.\n\nFar from getting fired over the scheme, Gattei became a media darling and a powerful political actor. Some are calling him corrupt and the move a threat to our government's integrity. Gattei prefers to call himself 'innovative'."

The golden light glowed in the many windows like the sun rising on a hall of mirrors. He could still hear the laughs from the decadent Griffenheim elite, but the part was anything but jovial. There was a pressure in the air. Like a string under tension on the verge of snapping. Surely everyone but the 12-year old Emperor could feel it.\n\nKing Gumberto of Wingbardy had kept a civil face throughout the whole ordeal and when Emperor Grover V had drifted asleep on his throne, he had taken his leave. “Meet me outside in fifteen minutes,” the king said to Garibald. Now Garibald peered out into the dim light of the courtyard. It wasn’t long until a pair of griffons came into sight, even in the darkness he could make out his father’s shape. He headed towards them. The pair of griffons argued in hushed voices. Suddenly there was the flash of a knife and a half-scream choked out of existence as it left his father’s throat.\n\nGaribald held his father in his arms, not caring for the blood that soiled his robes. There was so much of it. He screamed for help, but his father took his claw. The king tried to say something but all that came out was one last choke before he went limp.\n\nThe nobles came one by one and gathered around them like a wake of vultures. Even the young emperor still holding his doll and rubbing the sleep from his eyes – The Duke of Strawberry made sure he had a front row seat.\n\nGaribald awoke, not with a start, but with a pained tiredness. The early light of dawn lazily flowed through his windows. He glanced at the photograph by his bed of his late wife and young son before slowly rising to his feet. He stepped out onto his villa’s balcony and stared out across the olive trees and vineyards. His father’s killer was still out there, somewhere. All these years later he was no closer to the truth.

 POLITICS_GARIBALD_TALONUEL_DESC:0 ""
 POLITICS_BEAKOLINI_DESC:0 "Giulio Beakolini was born to a middle class family in 954, and from early age, he had a deep interest in politics. His family's republican leanings made them ardent supporters of the Republican Revolution in Griffonia, and their eventual defeat did not weaken, but rather intensify, young Giulio's support for the cause, especially the more radical left branches of the movement. During his younger years, he worked as a journalist and became a famous firebrand within the left wing of Wingbardian politics.\n\nThe Falcorian war, however, turned into a watershed moment for the young Beakolini, and unlike most of his peer, he was in full support of the war. Through it, he saw the workers being empowered through the fighting and a chance to bring together a divided land. This led to him being ostracized as a warmongerer, and he ended up fired, being told he could go fight the war himself if he viewed it as something good. Beakolini chose to take the insult literally and joined the Wingbardian army, where his zeal and determination let him become part of the elite Wingbardian Bersaglieri.\nWhen peace came, he was a changed griff, and whereas many had been broken on the battlefield, he had found his purpose. He returned to writing, only this time for his own ideology, and ever since then, he has tirelessly written for and organized his own political movement; the 'Blackwings'. He has realized that republicanism is weak and corrupt, socialism a false idol that will break apart the nation. The new path forward organizes the entire nation as one entity, where all griffs are soldiers for Wingbardy's glory. He has named this movement Fascism, and under it, he will see Wingbardy rise to become the master of Griffonia, or die trying."

His outspokenness against Beakolini's fascist movement has lead to many hoping for a quick crackdown of the Blackwings"

 WNG_trains_run_on_time:0 "Make the Trains Run on Time"
 WNG_trains_run_on_time_desc:0 "A tardy train is annoying, but a dozen late trains per day is economically unsustainable. By adopting new regulations based on incentives and punishments, we can maximise our railroad efficiency. This is, of course, something that even the common griffon will appreciate."
 WNG_crack_down_on_communists:0 "Crackdown on the Communists"
 WNG_crack_down_on_communists_desc:0 "We may have gained control of the cabinet, but we still have the issue of a dangerously polarised and militarised left. Beakolini and his ministers can pass legislation that will slowly curb the communists' powers. Prevention beats the cure, after all..."
 WNG_secure_parliament:0 "Secure the Parliament"
 WNG_secure_parliament_desc:0 "The communists have been taken care of, but our position isn't secure yet. We do not have a parliamentary majority, and the opposition could form a coalition against us. By introducing new majority policies, we can ensure full control over the parliament."
 WNG_education_reform:0 "Education Reform"

 WNG_news_censorship_desc:0 "The newspapers often spread pro-communist rhetoric, harmful to the Wingbardian people. Il Duce, who has won awards for his truthful and honest journalism, is now able to ensure that only the truth is shared with the griffons of the nation."
 WNG_glory_to_wingbardy:0 "Glory to Wingbardy"
 WNG_glory_to_wingbardy_desc:0 "Wingbardy has long since been the jewel of the South. Since the first days of the Empire, our great nation has been the envy of all griffons: a beacon to look up to.

 ### NEUTRAL-FASCIST DIPLO ###

 WNG_the_sicameon_question:0 "The Sicameon Question"
 WNG_the_sicameon_question_desc:0 "Sicameon has made it clear that they're not our friends. They have denounced our "anti-democratic" and "aggressive" policies. We should teach them a lesson of humility and remind the pathetic federation about who is the true ruler of the South!"
 
 WNG_subdue_old_allies:0 "Subdue Old Allies"
 WNG_subdue_old_allies_desc:0 "Talouse, Arantiga and Francistria all share cultural ties with Wingbardy. If we were to unite into a single state, we'd be the most powerful griffon state of the South. Let's make that into reality."
 WNG_reapproch_falcor:0 "Solidify Falcor"
 WNG_reapproch_falcor_desc:0 "The blood of over 460,000 Wingbardians was spilled in the Falcor War. While we did not start the war, through our might we brought the deceitful Falcorians to their knees. The city of Falcor was our prize. While Falcor was never truly defeated, more bloodshed is an unwelcome thought, but the city shall never be allowed to fall again."
 WNG_pressure_falcor:0 "Pressure Falcor"
 WNG_pressure_falcor_desc:0 "Falcor has always hated us ever since their defeat twenty years ago, and have continually pushed to regain their ancient capital. We must subdue the Falcorian threat, once and for all."

 WNG_demand_the_colonies:0 "Demand New Mareland"
 WNG_demand_the_colonies_desc:0 "For too long the ponies of Equestria have had a hoofhold on our rightful lands. They oppress the native griffons and exploit our riches for their own. We should demand the return of rightful griffon lands."
 WNG_claim_griffonstone:0 "Claim Griffonstone"
 WNG_claim_griffonstone_desc:0 "With the South secured, the ancient cradle of all griffons lies before us. Griffonstone has long since languished in its torpor, and its former glory is but a faded memory. Under Wingbardian rule, we shall restore its prestige and add to ours!"
 WNG_claim_the_throne:0 "Claim the Throne"
 WNG_claim_the_throne_desc:0 "The Empire has long since been a shadow of its former self, and an embarrassment to all of griffon Kind. Perhaps the only way to restore its ancient glory is to let a Southerner to take the throne."

 WNG_public_works_projects_desc:0 "With order now re-established, it is time for Wingbardy to deal with its underperforming economy. By subsidising national public works, we can immediately address the issue of unemployment. It'll take some time for the economy to recover fully, however."
 WNG_national_food_act:0 "National Food Act"
 WNG_national_food_act_desc:0 "Wingbardians may now have jobs, but they still lack food. If we can reinvigorate our own agriculture, we may be able to finally end this terrible famine and our dependence upon foreign exports."
 WNG_new_industrial_society:0 "Renewed Industries"
 WNG_new_industrial_society_desc:0 "Our economy is showing signs of recovery, but there is still much work to be done. With new investments to large corporations, our heavy industries will improve, as well as the overall economy of the country."

 WNG_secure_the_griffons_republic:0 "Secure the Griffons' Republic"

 WNG_rebuild_sociaty:0 "Rebuild Society"
 WNG_rebuild_sociaty_desc:0 "We have won the civil war, but our country lies shattered by it. By working with the remaining splinter parties, we can form a communist coalition and unify the left. Only then can we begin to heal the scars of war."
 WNG_rebuild_the_nation:0 "Rebuild the Nation"
 WNG_rebuild_the_nation:0 "The war has ravaged what little was left of our nation's industries and infrastructure. Now we have a chance to rebuild a true communist nation, and show that Wingbardy can rise stronger from the ashes."
 WNG_workers_collectives:0 "Workers' Collectives"
 WNG_workers_collectives_desc:0 "The country's rampant unemployment must be tackled, and we can begin to do so by forming strong labour unions and farming communes. This societal reform will not repair the problem in the short term, but it will bring about many benefits in the meantime."
 WNG_communist_education:0 "Communist Education"
 WNG_communist_education_desc:0 "We must re-educate society to understand and follow true communist ideals. Never again shall anyone think of themselves as more than just a cog in the communist machine."
 WNG_national_health_bureau:0 "National Health Bureau"
 WNG_national_health_bureau_desc:0 "For decades, the socialist parties of Wingbardy have called for a free, open and unified medical service for all Wingbardians. Now that the revolution has been won, we can make good on these promises by founding the National Health Bureau to oversee the well-being of all citizens."
 WNG_mines_for_miners:0 "Mines for the Miners"
 WNG_mines_for_miners_desc:0 "The dangerous occupation of the miner is now no longer under the ownership of the uncaring corporation. Mining unions will require government support to get started, but they will improve working conditions, morale and, most importantly, productivity."
 WNG_farms_for_farmers:0 "Farms for the Farmers"

 WNG_join_grw_desc:0 "Having fought hard to cast off the shackles of the old order, the [GRW.GetName] is perhaps the best example of a communist state and among one of the more powerful ones. With enemies on all sides, an alliance with the [GRW.GetName] will only be beneficial."
 WNG_free_the_bulls:0 "Liberate the Minotaurs"
 WNG_free_the_bulls_desc:0 "Asterion has long oppressed the labourers within its borders. We cannot stand idly any longer, and we shall install the rightful government, one way or another!"
 WNG_join_aquilia:0 "Join Aquileia"
 WNG_join_aquilia_desc:0 "Aquileia and its former autonomies have united into a socialist republic after a bloody revolution, and now stands to become the dominant power in the South-West. It would only make sense to approach them with offers of an alliance."
 WNG_divide_new_mareland:0 "Divide New Mareland"
 WNG_divide_new_mareland_desc:0 "The territories that are currently occupied by the colonial imperialists are rightfully Griffonian. We can reach to the local griffon populations and make them want for both Aquileian and Wingbardian rule. Out with the Equestrians!"

 WNG_our_own_way_desc:0 "There is no one that we can rely upon to free the working class except for ourselves. Wingbardy shall lead the revolution in the continent and beyond!"
 WNG_free_aquilian_workers:0 "Free the Aquileian Workers"
 WNG_free_aquilian_workers_desc:0 "The Aquileian proletariat is being stifled by their government, and thus not allowed to flourish as it has in Wingbardy. There can be no negotiation with the Aquileian state; the only way to achieve the liberation of the Aquileian is by force of arms."
 WNG_pressure_the_colonies:0 "Liberate the Ponies"
 WNG_pressure_the_colonies_desc:0 "While some scoff at the idea of ponies being able to thrive under a socialist system, we cannot overlook the fact that griffons are under foreign rule. We're a peaceful nation, so we'll offer the Equestrians the choice: relinquish griffon lands, or face war."
 WNG_the_workers_empire:0 "The Workers' Empire"
 WNG_the_workers_empire_desc:0 "There is no real difference between a 'Wingbardian' worker and the worker of any other griffon state. We are all united in our one effort to modernise our cities and communities. We are the true Griffonian Empire: the Workers' Empire."
 ### Neutral ###
 WNG_stop_the_march:0 "Stop the March"
 WNG_stop_the_march_desc:0 "Beakolini's march is madness: he threatens the very stability of the nation. We cannot allow his band of thugs to seize power of our great nation. The police and army remains loyal to the king, and they will stop the march by any means necessary."
 WNG_brake_the_political_deadlock:0 "Break the Political Deadlock"
 WNG_brake_the_political_deadlock_desc:0 "Enough is enough. It's time to end this political deadlock once and for all. The King will address parliament and demand that they produce results. Wingbardy needs leadership, and the King will provide it."

 ### Harmony ###
 WNG_librals:0 "Reinvigorate the Liberals"
 WNG_librals_desc:0 "The moderate left has often made its mark as a compromise between a conservative and a radical government. The King recognises the need for Wingbardy to start over, but will only step aside if the liberals do away with their more extreme ideas."
 WNG_embrace_harmony:0 "Embrace Harmony"
 WNG_embrace_harmony_desc:0 "Many of the PWd'A point to the stable country of Equestria over on Equus as a shining example of the concept of Harmony. Adopting a model similar to the Equestrians' may set Wingbardy on a path of restoring order."
 WNG_equestrian_aid:0 "Equestrian Aid"
 WNG_equestrian_aid_desc:0 "Having adopted Equestria's Harmonic form of government, we are in a good position to request aid from them. Being renowned for their bountiful food and giving disposition, it is highly likely Equestria will help us Wingbardians deal with the famine."

 WNG_pass_industrial_reforms_desc:0 "Now working with economic and social specialists that were traditionally left-wing, Wingbardian industry experts can set about to begin the long recovery from our economic and industrial stagnation."
 WNG_steel:0 "Privatise the Steel Industry"
 WNG_steel_desc:0 "In the past, steel and aluminium production had been government run, but have since been burdened by red tape. By allowing private companies to take over the mills with minimal government oversight, industry experts agree that our overall output will improve."
 WNG_lazius_fair:0 "Laissez-faire"
 WNG_lazius_fair_desc:0 "Following the Equestrians' lead we can lift most, if not all, of the redundant and restrictive regulations. By giving leeway to businesses and companies, the hope is for Wingbardy to see an amelioration of its economic and industrial output."
 WNG_equestrian_trade:0 "Equestrian Trade"
 WNG_equestrian_trade_desc:0 "With New Mareland as our neighbour, Wingbardy has an unique access to the Equestrian market overseas. It'd be foolish to not exploit this trade opportunity and improve our diplomatic standing with both Equestria and New Mareland."
 WNG_keep_our_friends_close:0 "Keep our Friends Close"
 WNG_keep_our_friends_close_desc:0 "With conflict intensifying abroad, Wingbardy cannot stand alone against our eventual foes. As such, we must reinforce our current alliance to ensure that we're not left alone. Even Falcor, our old enemy, may prove to be a useful ally."
 WNG_embrace_the_pony_way:0 "Embrace the Pony Way"
 WNG_embrace_the_pony_way_desc:0 "We have adopted so much from Equestria, why shouldn't we fully embrace their ways? Let the traditionalists and conservatives scoff at the idea - we know that ours is the only way to achieve true peace."

 WNG_school_for_gifted_griffons_desc:0 "Working with Equestria, we can establish a special academy in our nation that is inextricably linked to the famed Canterlot School for Gifted Unicorns. We may not have our own magic, but we have much to share with our pony kin as they do with us."

 WNG_harmony_with_griffon_characterises_desc:0 "We have striven to liken ourselves to the Equestrians, but there are hard, biological limits that makes our two species fundamentally different.

 WNG_arsenal_of_harmony:0 "Arsenal of Harmony"
 WNG_arsenal_of_harmony_desc:0 "With so much disharmony in the world, we cannot expect for things to be resolved peacefully. If Equestria won't step up, we shall be the ones to provide the arms to the righteous warriors fighting to achieve the peace that we're all after."
 WNG_cake_or_death:0 "Cake or Death"
 WNG_cake_or_death_desc:0 "It is clear that there are those who wish to sow the seeds of discord and watch the world burn. Wingbardians have always had good hearts, and we cannot abide those who purposefully seek to harm and destroy. We shall be the Blade of Harmony."
