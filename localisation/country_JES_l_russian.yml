 JES_form_your_battalions_desc:0 "Arise, children of the Fatherland, the day of glory has arrived! The Francistrian oppressors are coming, trying to prevent us from regaining our liberty. Every citizen must join the fight for Tarrin, and rather perish in battle than return to a life of slavery."

 JES_impure_blood:0 "Let An Impure Blood"
 JES_impure_blood_desc:0 "Francistrian colonists brought in by the despotic Martlewing government have been nothing but parasites and oppressors in Tarrin.

 JES_FRN_war_timer:0 "The War Of Independence"
 JES_FRN_war_timer_desc:0 "Francistrian propaganda, public statements and military strategies all predict a swift victory in Tarrin and a quick collapse of our "disorganized and decentralized" resistance. Should the conflict with Tarrin drag on, it will become clear to all that it is a war between nation-states instead of a counter-insurgency operation. At that point, public opinion and military leadership will demand the war in Tarrin to end."

 ### Country Leader & General descriptions
 JES_leontina_desc:0 "Leontina Pandionne was born to a poor family of shepherds near the fortified town of Château Accueillant. Life in her small village was peaceful and quiet, and her conservative parents taught her to love her homeland of Tarrin. Even the republican revolution did not disturb her childhood, at least until Count Francis VIII decided to take advantage of the situation and invaded.\n\nLeontina's parents joined the local militia in the fight against the foreign invaders, but it was in vain. Her parents perished and her village was burned and looted by Francistrian soldiers. She fled into the hills that surrounded her home and barely survived in the wilds, until a group of republican resistance fighters found her and provided her with shelter and food.\n\nAfter Tarrin was annexed into the County of Francistria, Leontina's band of rebels joined the larger FLNT movement which was rapidly organizing in the region. Her fellow freedom fighters became her family, and she quickly learned to be useful to the resistance. At first her small size was beneficial in sabotage, and as she grew older she learned to use weapons and became skilled in setting up ambushes.\n\nAs she fought against the occupiers, her heart was filled with purpose: She had to avenge her parents and drive out the foreign invaders. Her upbringing meant she was familiar with the countryside and traditional Tarrinian values, and thus could easily recruit peasants to join the ranks of FLNT.\n\nIf FLNT achieves its goal of independence, she feels obliged to participate in the elections, as if it was her responsibility to protect Tarrin and its culture. She is especially popular among the peasantry of Tarrin."
 JES_meinard_desc:0 "When the Aquileian revolution broke out in 980, it was Meinard Nocère who led the uprising in Tarrin against the despotic Discret Countess. It was him who ordered the execution of the tyrant by guillotine. It was him who was the first President of the Republic of Tarrin, preparing her homeland for joining the Aquileian Republic. It was him who led the desperate struggle against Count Francis VIII and his forces. It was him who fled into the hills and founded the FLNT, even as the revolution crumbled around him.\n\nMeinard's status among Tarrinians is close to mythical. For the longest time, most did not know if he even was alive anymore, or merely a story older Tarrinians told, of a hero who would one day miraculously liberate Tarrin from foreign oppression. For a long time, event the Governor-General Vittorio Felice was unsure if he was still alive or not.\n\nNow that FLNT has declared Tarrin's independence, Meinard has come out of hiding and revealed himself, leaving Tarrinians in awe and Francistrian in shock. Its as if he had risen from the dead to stand aside the griffons of Tarrin as they broke their chains once more.\n\nMeinard has close ties to the main republican movement in Aquileia, and especially to Théodore Vérany. He was born in Aquileia, but in his eyes Aquileians and Tarrinians are kinfolk with shared heritage. He has spent so many years fighting for Tarrin's freedom that no one cares where he comes from and most Tarrinians consider him a true national hero of Tarrin."
 JES_corina_desc:0 "Corina Trasviraire, commonly known as Colonel Corina, is an eccentric figure. Coming from a humble background, she joined the Royal Army Academy of Tarrin, but betrayed her superiors and joined the revolutionaries in 980. During the first Tarrinian elections, she founded AST, a socialist nationalist party, despite still being fairly young and inexperienced. She is strongly religious and nationalistic, yet is without a doubt a devout socialist. She advocates republican rule, yet is known for her authoritarian tendencies within the party.\n\nDue to leading a group of dissident officers who rebelled against the County, the republicans had a difficult time trusting her. Yet over the years, she slowly gained the trust she deserved by bravely fighting against the Francistrian invaders and organizing both passive and active resistance to occupation. At the same time, her popularity has grown among the citizens of Tarrin.\n\nReclusive, irrational and impulsive, yet also naive, intelligent and pious. To this day, Corina remains a controversial figure, but none doubt that she genuinely cares about the liberation of Tarrin and its inhabitants."
 
 ### Events
 tarrin.1.t:0 "[FRN.GetNameDef] Invades!"
 tarrin.1.d:0 "Our former oppressor, the [FRN.GetAdjective] government, has not recognized our declaration of independence and has mobilized their army. Their units are beginning to cross the border at this very moment. The foreign tyrants and slavers wish to extinguish the flame of our freedom before it truly gets to shine!\n\nWe will do everything possible to fight for our hard-earned liberty, but it might not be enough in the face of [FRN.GetAdjective] military might. Our only hope might lie in the west, in our Aquileian cousins. They did not come to our aid in 980s, but perhaps they will do so now, to redeem their lost honour and to prevent Tarrin from falling once again into possession of non-Aquileians."
 tarrin.1.a:0 "Seek aid from Aquileia!"
 tarrin.1.b:0 "We are on our own. Prepare for battle!"
 
 tarrin.2.t:0 "Tarrin Calls For Aid!"
 tarrin.2.d:0 "Tarrin, a region that was once a subject of Aquileia, recently declared independence as the freedom fighters of FLNT expelled the [FRN.GetAdjective] garrison. However, now the [FRN.GetAdjective] has been mobilized to retake the region and crush the resistance. The republican guerillas are now asking for us to come to their aid, so the region does not once again fall under foreign domination. While we may have ideological differences with the FLNT, should we simply stand by as our cousins are slaughtered by the lackeys of Wingbardy? If we do so, it might motivate Wingbardy to intervene as well, and escalate this into a large-scale conflict. We must be cautious."
 tarrin.2.a:0 "And Aquileia will answer!"
 tarrin.2.b:0 "We refuse to cooperate with terrorists of FLNT."
 
 tarrin.3.t:0 "Aquileia Abandons Us!"
 tarrin.3.d:0 "Unfortunately, our calls for aid have fallen on deaf ears, and the Aquileians refuse to come to our aid, leaving us to face the invader alone. We are outnumbered and outmatched, but we will not abandon hope! Our resistance hasn't faltered in the face of impossible odds before, and it shall not falter now. We will have to hold on as long as possible, so the enemy morale will falter and they will seek peace. Fight on, sons and daughters of Tarrin! Do not let the fire of freedom be extinguished so easily!"
 tarrin.3.a:0 "We will fight to the last griffon!"
 
 tarrin.4.t:0 "[FRN.GetNameDef] Retreats From Tarrin!"
 tarrin.4.d:0 "After months of bloodshed and desperate fighting, it seems the [FRN.GetAdjective] forces are pulling out of Tarrin. They expected a quick campaign and were unprepared for a full-scale war that lasted for this long. As such, they've had to retreat and enter the negotiation table with us. A cease-fire has been signed, and our independence secured, at least for now. The crisis is over and democratic elections for who shall lead the nation will soon be held.\n\nThe time for nation-wide celebration has come as we have boldly defeated our former oppressors! Tarrinians will never again be slaves to any foreign despot!"
 tarrin.4.a:0 "Vive la Tarrin! Vive la liberté!"
 
 tarrin.5.t:0 "Reunion"
 tarrin.5.d:0 "It was wise for the three leading figures of FLNT to never gather together in one place, so the leadership of the movement could never be eliminated in a single ambush. Therefore they almost never met each other, communicating exclusively with encrypted letters and telegrams, staying hidden and separate for as long as was needed.\n\nNow, they no longer had to hide like rats, or fear Francistrian agents spying their moves. They could meet freely, though just in case they still met in their secret underground headquarters. Meinard Nocère was already waiting there as Leontina Pandionne and Corina Trasviraire arrived, peacefully smoking a pipe and observing drafted military plans on the table. Leontina came first. The young freedom fighter bowed in respect.\n"Ah, Leontina, good to see you!" Meinard said with a smile. "You've become a true adult since we last met."\n"It's been a while, hasn't it?" She replied. "My entire life I've spent fighting against the barbarians. To think it could soon be over..."\n"Let's not get optimistic just yet. We still have to secure our independence."\nNext Corina entered the room, saluting Meinard like a soldier, her face stone-cold and serious.\n"You can drop the act, Corina, it's just the three of us here."\nCorina's expression became warmer and she let out a hearty chuckle, then sat down. "Even if the room was filled with my soldiers, I would act the same. There is no reason to be serious when we should rejoice instead!"\n"Not yet. It would be premature."\nCorina smirked. "And here I thought you were the optimist. What's the matter?"\n"Francistria may yet send their army to 'pacify' Tarrin. Aquileia may not recognize our independence. And to the north, stormclouds gather. We must make contingency plans for every scenario. We have gained our freedom, but we must continue to fight for it. Let us not rest on our laurels just yet."\nCorina and Leontina nodded, and the three began to plan together."
 tarrin.5.a:0 "The fight for Tarrin has only begun."
 
 tarrin.6.t:0 "Refugee Crisis"
 tarrin.6.d:0 "What started as a small stream of refugees has quickly turned into a flood. Thousands upon thousands of Francistrian colonists and Tarrinian collaborators are fleeing into Francistria proper, carrying what they can with them. Many of them lack food or water, or are either sickly or injured. Long wagon caravans clog up the roads, making it difficult to supply our military forces.\n\nRefugees are reporting about atrocities committing about Tarrinians, as well as forced expulsions and seizure of property. Some of the Tarrinians were treated even worse than the colonists, being regarded as heinous traitors.\n\nNow the government has to do what it can to take care of all these homeless, desperate refugees, straining its resources and distracting from any efforts to pacify Tarrin."
 tarrin.6.a:0 "FLNT are nothing but terrorists."
