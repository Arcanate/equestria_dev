 ### Foci
 JES_to_arms_citizens:0 "К оружию, гражданин!"
 JES_to_arms_citizens_desc:0 "Мы давно готовились к этому дню, тайно собирая контрабандное оружие из Аквелии. Теперь, наконец настал час вскрыть наши тайники и раздать оружие тем, кто с ним пойдёт в бой. О Святая Любовь к Отчизне, веди, направь наших солдат!"
 JES_form_your_battalions:0 "Сомкнём наши ряды!"
 JES_form_your_battalions_desc:0 "Восстаньте, дети Отчизны, настал день славы! Францистрийские угнетатели уже близко, они постараются помешать нам отвоевать нашу свободу. Каждый гражданин должен вступить в бой за Таррин, ведь смерть в бою куда лучше целой жизни в рабстве."
 JES_march_on:0 "Вперёд, вперёд!"
 JES_march_on_desc:0 "Довольно скрываться в холмах! Пора принять бой, как настоящие солдаты, маршировать строем в бой под барабанную дробь! Мы вступим в бой как дисциплинированная сила, сплочёная единой целью.\nОтец в слезах говорит своей Бабет: "Послушай, говорят, наши грифоны бьют в барабаны!""
 JES_impure_blood:0 "Пусть нечистая кровь"
 JES_impure_blood_desc:0 "Присланные деспотом Мартлвингом и его правительством в Таррин колонисты - не более, чем паразиты и угнетатели. Они отняли наши земли, насадили нам свой варварский язык и относятся к нам, как к скоту. К нам, к Тарринцам, ах! Какой ужас, к ним за это не будет никакой жалости!"
 JES_water_furrows:0 "Пропитает наши поля!"
 JES_water_furrows_desc:0 "Реки - артерии нашей нации, и они нам помогут в нашем священном бою. Мы подорвём дамбы, пробьём плотины и наводним системы орошения, чтобы обратить наши плодородные поля в непроходимые болота, дабы враг в них погряз. Тут всё против тебя, чужеземец, даже наши реки!"
 
 JES_second_elections:0 "Вторые выборы"
 JES_second_elections_desc:0 "Десятки лет тому назад, в Тарринской Республике в 980 прошли первые выборы. Увы, правительство тогда так и не было сформировано, так как в нас вторглась Францистрия. Теперь же мы снова свободны, и можем опять провести выборы. Старые партии уже вновь основаны и проводят избирательные кампании. Надеемся, ничто опять не прервёт избирательный процесс."
 
 JES_gaddafi_victory:0 "Свобода, Социализм, Единство"
 JES_gaddafi_victory_desc:0 "Партия Asunança Socialiste Tarrinenc во главе Корины Трансвирер победила на выборах, пообещав принести в Таррин прямую демократию и обширные социальные реформы. Их идеи радикальны, но их обещания светлого будущего нашли отклик в многих сердцах, особенно среди представителей низших слоев общества."
 JES_mixed_economy:0 "Путь к социализму"
 JES_mixed_economy_desc:0 "Как писала Карамель Маркс, путь к социализму лежит через капитализм. Вот почему наша Сестра-наставница издала указ о проведении реформ, которые сделают тарринскую экономику смешанной. Предприниматели получат поддержку, но в то же время жизненно важные активы, особенно принадлежащие иностранцам, будут национализированы. Это сочетание должно способствовать быстрому экономическому росту в стране."
 JES_green_revolution:0 "Зелённая Революция"
 JES_green_revolution_desc:0 "Обеспечение самодостаточности в производстве продуктов питания является важным приоритетом для любой нации. Сестра-наставница приказала, чтобы все земли, экспроприированные у францистрийских поселенцев, были безвозмездно переданы коренным тарринцам. Для облегчения жизни фермерам была введена система субсидирования."
 JES_nationalize_transista_oil:0 "Национализировать скважины Трансисты"
 JES_nationalize_transista_oil_desc:0 "Трансиста - небольшая провинция, но, тем не менее, важная благодаря своим месторождениям нефти. Однако в настоящее время они принадлежат нефтяным компаниям и инвесторам из Вингбардии, которые выводят большую часть прибыли за границу. Чтобы укрепить нацию, Сестра-наставница издала декрет о национализации нефтяных месторождений. Она считает, что это важный шаг к социализму."
 JES_invest_into_military:0 "Вооружение"
 JES_invest_into_military_desc:0 "Прибыль от экспорта нефти следует инвестировать не только в улучшение всеобщего благосостояния, но и в укрепление нашей военной промышленности. Суверенитет страны можно по-настоящему обеспечить только с помощью военной силы, а сила армии зависит от ее цепочки поставок. Расширение производства оружия также обеспечит работой тысячи граждан."
 JES_more_wages_less_rent:0 "Зарплаты больше, Аренды легче"
 JES_more_wages_less_rent_desc:0 "Мы готовы к исполнению предвыборных обещаний. Отныне минимальная заработная плата будет увеличена вдвое, будет введен контроль над ценами на товары первой необходимости, а арендная плата будет снижена повсеместно. Это значительно улучшит условия жизни жителей Таррина."
 JES_companies_to_cooperatives:0 "Кооперативы, не компании"
 JES_companies_to_cooperatives_desc:0 "Сестра-наставница хочет разрушить бюрократию и ликвидировать частный сектор экономики. Поэтому контроль над предприятиями и компаниями будет передан работникам, которые в них работают. Кооперативы с демократически избранными представителями заменят диктаторское руководство капиталистов и владельцев бизнеса."
 JES_house_for_every_family:0 "Дом для каждой семьи"
 JES_house_for_every_family_desc:0 "Францистрийцев мало заботили условия жизни тарринцев. Во многих городах, особенно в самом Таррине, есть убогие трущобы и бездомные грифоны, склоняющиеся по улицам. Сестра-наставница не может мириться с такой бедностью в нашем славном Таррине и издала постановление об обширных программах строительства, чтобы обеспечить жилище каждой семье."
 JES_haven_of_socialism:0 "Гнездо Социализма"
 JES_haven_of_socialism_desc:0 "Путем терпеливого реформирования мы строим поистине социалистическую экономику, принадлежащую государству и управляемую рабочими. Уровень жизни в нашей маленькой стране быстро повысился, и даже скептики социализма должны признать, что стратегия нашей сестры-наставницы сработала хорошо. Теперь мы можем пожинать красные плоды нашего труда!"
 JES_state_control_trade:0 "Плановая торговля"
 JES_state_control_trade_desc:0 "Жадные, корыстные индивиды уже достаточно долго эксплуатируют экономику Таррина. С этого дня государство будет напрямую управлять импортом и экспортом. Государственные универмаги предоставят гражданам все необходимое, сохраняя низкие цены и гарантируя, что доходы пойдут на благо рабочим."

Но вот если конфликт в Таррине затянется, всем станет ясно, что это борьба государств, а не антитеррористическая операция.

 ### Country Leader & General descriptions
 JES_leontina_desc:0 "Leontina Pandionne was born to a poor family of shepherds near the fortified town of Château Accueillant. Life in her small village was peaceful and quiet, and her conservative parents taught her to love her homeland of Tarrin. Even the republican revolution did not disturb her childhood, at least until Count Francis VIII decided to take advantage of the situation and invaded.\n\nLeontina's parents joined the local militia in the fight against the foreign invaders, but it was in vain. Her parents perished and her village was burned and looted by Francistrian soldiers. She fled into the hills that surrounded her home and barely survived in the wilds, until a group of republican resistance fighters found her and provided her with shelter and food.\n\nAfter Tarrin was annexed into the County of Francistria, Leontina's band of rebels joined the larger FLNT movement which was rapidly organizing in the region. Her fellow freedom fighters became her family, and she quickly learned to be useful to the resistance. At first her small size was beneficial in sabotage, and as she grew older she learned to use weapons and became skilled in setting up ambushes.\n\nAs she fought against the occupiers, her heart was filled with purpose: She had to avenge her parents and drive out the foreign invaders. Her upbringing meant she was familiar with the countryside and traditional Tarrinian values, and thus could easily recruit peasants to join the ranks of FLNT.\n\nIf FLNT achieves its goal of independence, she feels obliged to participate in the elections, as if it was her responsibility to protect Tarrin and its culture. She is especially popular among the peasantry of Tarrin."
 JES_meinard_desc:0 "When the Aquileian revolution broke out in 980, it was Meinard Nocère who led the uprising in Tarrin against the despotic Discret Countess. It was him who ordered the execution of the tyrant by guillotine. It was him who was the first President of the Republic of Tarrin, preparing her homeland for joining the Aquileian Republic. It was him who led the desperate struggle against Count Francis VIII and his forces. It was him who fled into the hills and founded the FLNT, even as the revolution crumbled around him.\n\nMeinard's status among Tarrinians is close to mythical. For the longest time, most did not know if he even was alive anymore, or merely a story older Tarrinians told, of a hero who would one day miraculously liberate Tarrin from foreign oppression. For a long time, event the Governor-General Vittorio Felice was unsure if he was still alive or not.\n\nNow that FLNT has declared Tarrin's independence, Meinard has come out of hiding and revealed himself, leaving Tarrinians in awe and Francistrians in shock. Its as if he had risen from the dead to stand aside the griffons of Tarrin as they broke their chains once more.\n\nMeinard has close ties to the main republican movement in Aquileia, and especially to Théodore Vérany. He was born in Aquileia, but in his eyes Aquileians and Tarrinians are kinfolk with shared heritage. He has spent so many years fighting for Tarrin's freedom that no one cares where he comes from and most Tarrinians consider him a true national hero of Tarrin."
 JES_corina_desc:0 "Corina Trasviraire, commonly known as Colonel Corina, is an eccentric figure. Coming from a humble background, she joined the Royal Army Academy of Tarrin, but betrayed her superiors and joined the revolutionaries in 980. During the first Tarrinian elections, she founded AST, a socialist nationalist party, despite still being fairly young and inexperienced. She is strongly religious and nationalistic, yet is without a doubt a devout socialist. She advocates republican rule, yet is known for her authoritarian tendencies within the party.\n\nDue to leading a group of dissident officers who rebelled against the County, the republicans had a difficult time trusting her. Yet over the years, she slowly gained the trust she deserved by bravely fighting against the Francistrian invaders and organizing both passive and active resistance to occupation. At the same time, her popularity has grown among the citizens of Tarrin.\n\nReclusive, irrational and impulsive, yet also naive, intelligent and pious. To this day, Corina remains a controversial figure, but none doubt that she genuinely cares about the liberation of Tarrin and its inhabitants."
 
 ### Events
 tarrin.1.t:0 "[FRN.GetNameDef] Invades!"
 tarrin.1.d:0 "Our former oppressor, the [FRN.GetAdjective] government, has not recognized our declaration of independence and has mobilized their army. Their units are beginning to cross the border at this very moment. The foreign tyrants and slavers wish to extinguish the flame of our freedom before it truly gets to shine!\n\nWe will do everything possible to fight for our hard-earned liberty, but it might not be enough in the face of [FRN.GetAdjective] military might. Our only hope might lie in the west, in our Aquileian cousins. They did not come to our aid in 980s, but perhaps they will do so now, to redeem their lost honour and to prevent Tarrin from falling once again into possession of non-Aquileians."
 tarrin.1.a:0 "Seek aid from Aquileia!"
 tarrin.1.b:0 "We are on our own. Prepare for battle!"
 
 tarrin.2.t:0 "Tarrin Calls For Aid!"
 tarrin.2.d:0 "Tarrin, a region that was once a subject of Aquileia, recently declared independence as the freedom fighters of FLNT expelled the [FRN.GetAdjective] garrison. However, now the [FRN.GetAdjective] has been mobilized to retake the region and crush the resistance. The republican guerillas are now asking for us to come to their aid, so the region does not once again fall under foreign domination. While we may have ideological differences with the FLNT, should we simply stand by as our cousins are slaughtered by the lackeys of Wingbardy? If we do so, it might motivate Wingbardy to intervene as well, and escalate this into a large-scale conflict. We must be cautious."
 tarrin.2.a:0 "And Aquileia will answer!"
 tarrin.2.b:0 "We refuse to cooperate with terrorists of FLNT."
 
 tarrin.3.t:0 "Aquileia Abandons Us!"
 tarrin.3.d:0 "Unfortunately, our calls for aid have fallen on deaf ears, and the Aquileians refuse to come to our aid, leaving us to face the invader alone. We are outnumbered and outmatched, but we will not abandon hope! Our resistance hasn't faltered in the face of impossible odds before, and it shall not falter now. We will have to hold on as long as possible, so the enemy morale will falter and they will seek peace. Fight on, sons and daughters of Tarrin! Do not let the fire of freedom be extinguished so easily!"
 tarrin.3.a:0 "We will fight to the last griffon!"
 
 tarrin.4.t:0 "[FRN.GetNameDef] Retreats From Tarrin!"
 tarrin.4.d:0 "After months of bloodshed and desperate fighting, it seems the [FRN.GetAdjective] forces are pulling out of Tarrin. They expected a quick campaign and were unprepared for a full-scale war that lasted for this long. As such, they've had to retreat and enter the negotiation table with us. A cease-fire has been signed, and our independence secured, at least for now. The crisis is over and democratic elections for who shall lead the nation will soon be held.\n\nThe time for nation-wide celebration has come as we have boldly defeated our former oppressors! Tarrinians will never again be slaves to any foreign despot!"
 tarrin.4.a:0 "Vive le Tarrin! Vive la liberté!"
 
 tarrin.5.t:0 "Reunion"
 tarrin.5.d:0 "It was wise for the three leading figures of FLNT to never gather together in one place, so the leadership of the movement could never be eliminated in a single ambush. Therefore they almost never met each other, communicating exclusively with encrypted letters and telegrams, staying hidden and separate for as long as was needed.\n\nNow, they no longer had to hide like rats, or fear Francistrian agents spying their moves. They could meet freely, though just in case they still met in their secret underground headquarters. Meinard Nocère was already waiting there as Leontina Pandionne and Corina Trasviraire arrived, peacefully smoking a pipe and observing drafted military plans on the table. Leontina came first. The young freedom fighter bowed in respect.\n"Ah, little Leontina, good to see you!" Meinard said with a smile. "You've become a true adult since we last met."\n"It's been a while, hasn't it?" She replied. "My entire life I've spent fighting against the barbarians. To think it could soon be over..."\n"Let's not get optimistic just yet. We still have to secure our independence."\nNext Corina entered the room, saluting Meinard like a soldier, her face stone-cold and serious.\n"You can drop the act, Corina, it's just the three of us here."\nCorina's expression became warmer and she let out a hearty chuckle, then sat down. "I wish I could drop the act when I am around my soldiers. There is no reason to be serious when we should rejoice instead!"\n"Not yet. It would be premature."\nCorina smirked. "And here I thought you were the optimist. What's the matter?"\n"Francistria may yet send their army to 'pacify' Tarrin. Aquileia may not recognize our independence. And to the north, stormclouds gather. We must make contingency plans for every scenario. We have gained our freedom, but we must continue to fight for it. Let us not rest on our laurels just yet."\nCorina and Leontina nodded, and the three began to plan together."
 tarrin.5.a:0 "The fight for Tarrin has only begun."
 
 tarrin.6.t:0 "Refugee Crisis"
 tarrin.6.d:0 "What started as a small stream of refugees has quickly turned into a flood. Thousands upon thousands of Francistrian colonists and Tarrinian collaborators are fleeing into Francistria proper, carrying what they can with them. Many of them lack food or water, or are either sickly or injured. Long wagon caravans clog up the roads, making it difficult to supply our military forces.\n\nRefugees are reporting about atrocities committing about Tarrinians, as well as forced expulsions and seizure of property. Some of the Tarrinians were treated even worse than the colonists, being regarded as heinous traitors.\n\nNow the government has to do what it can to take care of all these homeless, desperate refugees, straining its resources and distracting from any efforts to pacify Tarrin."
 tarrin.6.a:0 "FLNT are nothing but terrorists."
 
 tarrin.7.t:0 "The Pan-Aquileian Cause"
 tarrin.7.d:0 "Meinard Nocère, the hero of Tarrin, was relaxing on the balcony of his office and smoking a pipe. The weather was clear and sunny, which reflected the mood in the country at the time. Meinard sighed wistfully, somehow knowing deep inside it wouldn't last.\n\nThere was a creaking sound as Leontina Pandionne opened the door to the balcony. "Ah, there you are, Marshal. I was looking for you."\nMeinard blew out smoke from his beak. "Oh yes, you wanted to meet. What's the matter, little Leontina?"\nShe sat down on a chair next to him, took in a deep breath as if preparing to fly off a cliff, and spoke. "Marshal, do you still... intend to cooperate with the Aquileians?"\n"With the republicans? Why yes, of course. They are our close friends. Their cause is our cause."\n"But their cause is doomed to fail, I fear. And even if it didn't, why should we still consider them friends? Where was Aquileia when the barbarians invaded?"\nMeinard frowned, and inhaled smoke from his pipe. "They were busy securing their own revolution. Besides, Francistria was allied with Wingbardy. They couldn't risk a war with them."\nLeontina pouted. "Or maybe they don't care for Tarrin and its independence. Do you still intend for Tarrin to become part of Aquileia? Just throw away the hard-fought freedom we've earned?"\nThe older griffon seemed increasingly uncomfortable. "Well, we'd still be free being part of an Aquileian Republic, just not sovereign. For me, it's democracy that truly matters."\nLeontina stood up and grimaced. "So it's as I feared. Your mind is set, I can tell, but I cannot agree with that." She placed a claw on her chest. "By Boreas, I am a Tarrinian, not an Aquileian!"\nMeinard set aside his pipe. "Little Leontina, please, calm down-"\n"I've now made my decision. I will run for President, and if I win, I will make sure Tarrin remains truly free. I'd rather die than live again in slavery!" She then took off, flying away from the balcony.\n\nMeinard was certain he saw tears in her eyes as she did so."
 tarrin.7.a:0 "Tarrinians think she's misguided."
 tarrin.7.b:0 "Tarrinians think she's right."
 
 tarrin.8.t:0 "The Blue Book"
 tarrin.8.d:0 "With elections approaching, one of the leading figures of FLNT's socialist wing and the head of the socialist AST party, Corina Trasviraire, was strangely absent from public stage. However, it turns out he was just preparing the publication of a book he had written during his time as a resistance fighter. Now, it has been released across the nation and copies are being given out freely to commoners in towns and villages. Of course, many citizens remain illiterate, but those that weren't read the book out of curiosity.\n\nThe book was simply called "The Blue Book". It was relatively short, written personally by Corina and meant to be read by everyone in Tarrin. It outlined Corina's own political views and her plans for the future, if she will be elected President.\n\nThe book condemns capitalism, but also communism, and curiously also denounces political parties, parliaments and constitutions. Instead, it advocates socialism, direct democracy and nationalism. Instead of a parliament, Tarrin should have a system of popular committees and conferences so power is not delegated to a ruling minority. It calls for the abolishment of wage labour, elimination of exploitation and devolution of the state. She emphasised the importance of family, equality and freedom of speech.\n\nIn an interview with a reporter for a newly-founded Tarrin newspaper, Meinard Nocère called the book "a bunch of nonsense" and expressed his disappointment with Corina running for Presidency, saying it makes the nation more divided than it should be."
 tarrin.8.a:0 "Tarrinians care little for the book."
 tarrin.8.b:0 "Tarrinians fall in love with the book!"
 
 tarrin.9.t:0 "Two Sides Of The Same Coin"
 tarrin.9.d:0 "Soon after Leontina heard the news that Corina was running for presidency, she wanted to have a public political debate with Corina. Because of Corina's nationalist platform, she saw her as a challenger who could easily win the favour of her own voting base. Leontina knew she'd have to beat her face-to-face in a debate to prove herself as a superior candidate.\n\nCorina accepted the invitation to a debate and soon enough the two met on stage in Griffoble, their speech being broadcast by radio so Tarrinians across the country could listen to it.\nAfter short and formal introductions, Leontina opened the debate proper. "First of all, I want to say that I've read your book, just so we're clear. And while I have tremendous respect for you as a resistance fighter, I found many things to disagree with in this tome. And to be frank, some of it is just strange. You condemn representative democracy, yet are trying to get elected President?"\nCorina shrugged with her characteristic, laid back smirk. "Well, can't reform representative democracy into something else without becoming President first, you know? I might be a revolutionary, but I only overthrow monarchical regimes, not democratic ones."\n"Hmpf, fair enough. But you also advocate for socialism. Don't you know socialism as an economic system cannot work?"\nCorina almost burst out laughing. "Hah, everygriff knows true socialism hasn't been tried yet."\n"And these conferences and committees, they sound borderline anarchical. How can Tarrin be strong and united if it is made so internally divided?"\n"You know, you're doing pretty well in a debate for someone so young," Corina said with a warm smile. "I'm impressed, you have a fiery spirit and I respect that. But in debates it is usually polite to let the other side speak freely instead of just bombarding them with critique."\nLeontina was taken aback and stuttered with her speech. "O-oh, right. My apologies."\n\nThe debate continued long into the afternoon, with both sides making good points."
 tarrin.9.a:0 "Tarrinians are impressed with Leontina's arguments."
 tarrin.9.b:0 "Tarrinians are swayed by Corina's arguments."
 tarrin.9.c:0 "Tarrinians see both sides as flawed."
 
 tarrin.10.t:0 "Election Day"
 tarrin.10.d:0 "All of Tarrin was abuzz with activity on the day of the elections. Many of the older Tarrinians felt nostalgic for the last election day in 980, while the younger ones were eager to finally have their voices be heard. As the country was in need of both a head of state and a parliament, it was a dual election of sorts, with both votes being held simultaneously. The three main contenders for political positions were RTA, a Tarrinian-Aquileian republican party led by Meinard Nocère, PNT, a relatively young nationalist party whose figurehead was Leontina Pandionne, and AST, the old socialist party whose leader had always been Corina Trasviraire. It was quite likely that the party that would win a majority would also get their candidate voted President, so most Tarrinians treated both elections as one.\n\nVoter turnout was even higher than it had been in 980, and counting began as soon as the ballots were closed. All of Tarrin held its breath and eagerly awaited to hear the results being revealed on the radio, as it would decide the fate of the nation itself. Despite stark differences between the policies of the three parties, the country was peaceful as its griffons respected the democratic process. Whatever the results may be, they will be accepted by all three parties and their leaders."
 tarrin.10.a:0 "Meinard Nocère becomes President!"
 tarrin.10.b:0 "Leontina Pandionne becomes President!"
