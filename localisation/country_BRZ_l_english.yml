 ### FOCUS ###

 # Economic #
 
 BRZ_finish_the_ravenworks:0 "Finish the Grover V Industrial Park"
 BRZ_finish_the_ravenworks_desc:0 "The Grover V Industrial Park is a free economic zone conceptualized by the economic ministers of Grover V and Count Ignatius Bronzetail. The goal of the project is to attract investment from Griffenheim in order to finance new factories in the region. The closeness of the industrial park and the loyalty of our government ensures the safety of investment while also offering easy access to Griffonian markets."

 BRZ_engineering_grants:0 "Hire Imperial Experts"
 BRZ_engineering_grants_desc:0 "Bronzehill’s industrial sector has lagged far behind much of the continent, owing to the mismanagement and poor expertise of the Diamond Dog administration advising its development. As such, our administration has requested help from Griffenheim in the hopes that our emperor will come to our aid and provide technical assistance to correct the damage done."

 BRZ_nationalise_the_ravenworks:0 "Nationalize the Grover V Industrial Park"
 BRZ_nationalise_the_ravenworks_desc:0 "The Grover V Industrial Park has not been a silver bullet to help kickstart our industrial revolution. Instead many of the plots remain barren and the few established firms either flounder or fail to make a profit. As such, many within our imperial administration have called on us to nationalize the industrial park and put it under state management until it proves stable and profitable."

 BRZ_give_to_the_poor:0 "Form a Social Safety Net"
 BRZ_give_to_the_poor_desc:0 "Many of Bronzehill’s citizens live in crushing poverty with the toil of their day to day life spent on nothing but the food, shelter, and resources to survive. In order to address this issue, our administration has earmarked funding for a generous social programme which will include housing, healthcare, and food subsidizes for our poorest citizens."

 BRZ_local_owned_industries:0 "Subsidise Domestic Firms"
 BRZ_local_owned_industries_desc:0 "The vast majority of Bronzehill’s economic activity has been controlled by firms whose headquarters are located within Griffenheim and Mirabelle. While these firms prosper from Bronzehill’s wealth, our own domestic firms have proved lackluster, failing to reach the same level of prominence. By subsidizing such firms we’d greatly benefit from increased domestic influence in economic affairs."

 BRZ_found_bronze_olwerke:0 "Bronze Ole"
 BRZ_found_bronze_olwerke_desc:0 "For the last 20 years, surveyors have stalked our lands in search of natural resources. During the course of their landscaping, these teams discovered a substantial reserve of oil and natural gas in Pinesshade. While currently free from development, a group of investors have pooled together their resources to establish Bronze Ole, a domestic energy firm which hopes to capitalize off our rich reserves."

 BRZ_kickstart_the_automotive_industry:0 "Bronzehill Automotive Firm"
 BRZ_kickstart_the_automotive_industry_desc:0 "Across the globe, the automobile has allowed for easier, quicker, and more reliable transportation of people and goods. Previously, the automobile was an oddity in Bronzehill, only accessible to those rich enough to import models from Griffenheim. With the opening the Bronzehill Automotive Firm however, it’s hoped that the automobile will become all the more accessible."

 BRZ_the_forges_of_the_bronze_paw:0 "A Bronzehill Industrial Revolution"
 BRZ_the_forges_of_the_bronze_paw_desc:0 "The economy of Bronzehill stands triumphant as we enter the next stage of our industrial modernization. While there is much progress to be made, we can look back proudly knowing that it was through our own blood, sweat, and tears that we have made it this far."

 BRZ_found_vereinigte_stahlwerke:0 "Vereinigte Stahlwerk"
 BRZ_found_vereinigte_stahlwerke_desc:0 "For decades, the firms of the Griffonian Empire have set up steel mills in Bronzekreuz, using the regions rich supplies of coal, iron, and cheap labour to produce steel. Little of this remains within Bronzehill, with the bulk being exported while we are left in chronic shortage. To address this, our government has entered into a partnership with Diamond Dog investors to set a domestically operated enterprise."

 BRZ_farming_subsidies:0 "Agricultural Grants"
 BRZ_farming_subsidies_desc:0 "The mountainous geography and chilly climate of Bronzehill have made the development of agriculture rather difficult, putting us in a situation where we rely heavily upon the import of food in order to feed our dogs. However, with proper funding we can provide grants to firms willing to build irrigation networks and import modern agrochemicals into our nation, greatly increasing productivity."

 BRZ_young_readers_programmes:0 "Establish a Unified Curriculum"
 BRZ_young_readers_programmes_desc:0 "While education is mandatory for all pups under the age of 9, the curriculum and quality of lessons can vary greatly depending on which region the pup resides. This has resulted in some towns and villages offering a subpar education which can even flounder in providing basic literacy. By creating a unified curriculum and hiring qualified teachers we can ensure a solid education for all pups to come."

 BRZ_open_the_university_of_bronzekreuz:0 "Bronzekreuz Imperial University"
 BRZ_open_the_university_of_bronzekreuz_desc:0 "Bronzehill is the only nation in the entire Griffonian Empire without a centre for higher education, resulting in many students having to venture abroad to complete their studies. The establishment of a proper centre of learning within Bronzekreuz would hopefully divert this brain drain and help to create a centre for research, scientific thought, and higher learning upon our very own soil."

 BRZ_clan_azar_dun_exiles:0 "Welcome Refugees from Clan Azar-Dun"
 BRZ_clan_azar_dun_exiles_desc:0 "Within the depths of the Diamond Mountain resides a clan of Diamond Dogs especially skilled at the building, maintenance, and development of complex electronics. These dogs are known as the Warlock-Engineers of Clan Azar-Dun. While these dogs receive substantial rewards from the tyrants of the mountain, many within their ranks still wish to flee to the safety of our realm."

 BRZ_scientific_research_groups:0 "BITE"
 BRZ_scientific_research_groups_desc:0 "The Bronzehill Institute of Technicians and Engineers was established in order to pool together the collective mental resources of our nation. The goal of this institute is to provide a venue for the collaboration of projects in the hope that it’ll make the research and development of new technologies proceed quicker than before."

 BRZ_expand_crystal_mines:0 "Embracing Our Legacy"
 BRZ_expand_crystal_mines_desc:0 "The extraction of precious gems and crystals has always been an integral part of Diamond Dog culture, dating back to the first of our clans. Our nation is no exception, providing the most lucrative crystal mines within the entire empire. While their production is already impressive, there is still room for expansion with the possibility of mines in Crownspike looking especially promising."

 BRZ_liberal_banking_reform:0 "Liberalize te Bronzehill Banking System"
 BRZ_liberal_banking_reform_desc:0 "The Bronzehill banking system was hit hard in the aftermath of the empire’s decline, resulting in the defaulting of many branches. While there has been some recovery since the worst days, our banking system still rests on a rocky foundation. By liberalizing our banking laws, we can create a more attractive environment for foreign finance to enter and eject fresh capital into our economy and banks."

 BRZ_extend_development_grants:0 "Prop Up the Grover V Industrial Park"
 BRZ_extend_development_grants_desc:0 "The Grover V Industrial Park has not been a silver bullet to help kickstart our industrial revolution. Instead many of the plots remain barren and the few established firms either flounder or fail to make a profit. As such, our government has begun to offer subsidizes and grants to foreign firms willing to relocate to the park in the hope that it’ll attract better equipped businesses who can generate a profit."

 BRZ_reopen_the_markets:0 "Make Goldtooth Economic Minister"
 BRZ_reopen_the_markets_desc:0 "Max Goldtooth is a renown economist within the Griffonian Empire who preaches a hardline liberal stance on economic affairs, believing that governments should provide little oversight over the actions of private firms. By offering him a position in our administration, it’s hoped that he can make Bronzehill a lucrative investment for capitalists in Griffenheim and beyond."

 BRZ_imperial_cooperation:0 "Deepen Imperial Ties"
 BRZ_imperial_cooperation_desc:0 "Griffenheim has always been a reliable investor in our economy, bringing our nation from the brink of ruin to the state it’s in today. We must once again go to the imperial court and plead our case, begging their excellency to come to our aid and strengthen the economic ties which have served us so well."

 BRZ_investment_competition:0 "Attract Foriegn Investment"
 BRZ_investment_competition_desc:0 "By relying upon the capitalists and nobles of Griffenheim to finance our economic development, we severely constricted the supply of capital on which we could call upon. Our lands are rich in resources and our dogs willing to work hard for their future. We are a land ripe with possible investments and we should begin to cut deals based on profits and not loyalty to the imperial throne."

 BRZ_expand_the_ravenworks:0 "Expand the Grover V Industrial Park"
 BRZ_expand_the_ravenworks_desc:0 "What was once a floundering enterprise, on the brink of death, has become a success story with millions of bits worth of profits flowing into the coffers of Bronzekreuz and Griffenheim. The space offered by the Grover V Industrial Park has been completed rented out and there are calls to expand the industrial infrastructure in the hope of securing more firms and investment for our nation’s development."

 BRZ_underground_railway:0 "Underground Railroad"
 BRZ_underground_railway_desc:0 "Diamond Dogs might have many shortcomings but our skill at taming mountainous terrain is matched by none. While other species struggle to build infrastructure upon mountains, we have learned to bury deep below them, laying our track and building our roads along the vast tunnel networks our ancestors have excavated for generations."
 
 BRZ_refit_standerd_rail_gages:0 "Adopt the Imperial Rail Gauge"
 BRZ_refit_standerd_rail_gages_desc:0 "There is one last hurdle that remains in the way of trade between our economy and that of the Griffonian Empire as a whole. This is the issue of our rail gauges. Due to our heavy use of subterranean trade networks we have adapted to smaller trains on thinner tracks. By retrofitting the rail lines of our southern lands, to the Imperial standard, we can more easily trade with our Griffon allies."

 BRZ_the_new_industrial_heartland:0 "A Griffonian Industrial Revolution"
 BRZ_the_new_industrial_heartland_desc:0 "The economy of Bronzehill stands triumphant as we enter the next stage of our industrial modernization. While there is much progress to be made, we can look back proudly, knowing that it was through our unwavering loyalty to the crown and closeness to the empire that we managed to make it this far."

 BRZ_industrial_reform_laws:0 "Industrial Reforms"
 BRZ_industrial_reform_laws_desc:0 "Many of the inefficient and archaic bureaucracies which plagued our initial industrial revolution still linger to this day, offering a barrier to firms wishing to establish themselves in our lands. By removing many of the old guard within these agencies, we can install fresh blood and reform the organizations into something which can actually benefit economic development."

 BRZ_employment_works_act:0 "Right to Fair Work Act"
 BRZ_employment_works_act_desc:0 "The Right to Fair Work Act mandates that the goal of the Bronzehill government is to ensure that every Diamond Dog who is willing, is employed within a field which will provide them with the resources to live a fulfilling life. In order to accomplish this goal, the government will subsidize firms in order to ensure the opening of new positions and establishment of a living wage."

 BRZ_hundburg_mine:0 "Hundburg Mine"
 BRZ_hundburg_mine_desc:0 "The mountains of Bronzehill are rich in resources necessary to fuel our industrial revolution. However, new mines must be built to access these reserves. A promising location for such mines is near the village of Hundburg. Reports from prospectors in the region have generated a buzz amongst Griffenheim’s investors and already requests have flooded in, begging us to lease these lands."

 # Military #

 BRZ_military_budget_review:0 "Defense Budget of 1007"
 BRZ_military_budget_review_desc:0 "Military funding has never been a very high priority amongst the ministers of Bronzehill, owing to the ethos of pacifism that both our government and dogs share. This had led to our military being severely outdated with equipment which is decades obsolete. However, with tensions rising on the continent it has become vital to begin modernizing our forces."

 BRZ_review_the_defencive_lines:0 "Bunkers are our Backbone"
 BRZ_review_the_defencive_lines_desc:0 "The limited scale of our military means that it can only engage meaningfully when on the defensive. Thankfully, the mountainous terrain of Bronzehill and the subterranean nature of Diamond Dogs have allowed us to develop an intricate system of bunkers within the mountains. With additional funding, these fortifications can be upgraded and better equipped for the conflict ahead."

 BRZ_fortify_against_the_south:0 "Fortify the Lowlands"
 BRZ_fortify_against_the_south_desc:0 "The lowlands of Bronzehill house the bulk of the nation’s population, industry, and economic development. As such, it should be our upmost priority to fortify these regions in the face of foreign invasion, creating a compressive network of bunkers, fall back positions, and subterranean tunnel systems."

 BRZ_fortify_against_the_west:0 "Fortify the Bellen"
 BRZ_fortify_against_the_west_desc:0 "The Bellen River acts as a vital artery connecting our lands to Griffenheim. Along this river is the bulk of our industrial base, economy, and resources extraction facilities. If this artery were to be severed the imperial throne would lose an important source of resources for their war effort. As such, it’s important that we centre our defences on this river and ensure that it remains open to trade."

 BRZ_defence_plan_bone_focus:0 "War Plan Bone"
 BRZ_defence_plan_bone_focus_desc:0 "War Plan Bone was first drafted in 976, by Field Martial Theo Kaza-Gull in the face of possible invasion from the east by River Federation forces. It calls for a rigid defensive line to be formed on the frontier by a vanguard force which will buy time to evacuate materials, resources, and divisions into the mountains of Highhill and Crownspike where they will fight a protracted guerilla campaign."

 BRZ_anti_pacifism_campaign:0 "Challenge our Ethos"
 BRZ_anti_pacifism_campaign_desc:0 "Pacifism has been a core component of Bronzehill society since its inception, owing to the oppression many of our dogs faced at the hands of the Diamond Mountain military. While these traumas will take generations to be resolved, our borders are now immediately threatened. We must bend this spirit of pacifism in order to ensure the security of our nation."

 BRZ_reopen_bronzekreuz_militery_acadamy:0 "Reopen the Bronzekreuz Military Academy"
 BRZ_reopen_bronzekreuz_militery_acadamy_desc:0 "The Bronzekreuz Military Academy was opened soon after our independence, with Griffenheim using it to help foster a domestic officer corp. However, when it became apparent that our military would never grow beyond a self-defence force, the facility was defunded and shut down. Now, In the face of nearing conflict, it has become vital that we reopen this academy."

 BRZ_armour_tests:0 "Mobile Bunkers"
 BRZ_armour_tests_desc:0 "The Imperial Army has experimented with armoured warfare for some time, developing a few battalions of tanks to augment their forces. The effectiveness of tanks in warfare can not be understated. Of special interest to us are the heavier designs, which would help guarantee our defenses with the ability to plug breaches in our lines with these mobile bunkers."

 BRZ_modern_guns:0 "Mobile Artillery"
 BRZ_modern_guns_desc:0 "The combination of a tank chassis with one of our phenomenally designed artillery pieces allows them to be moved under their own independent propulsion. By developing a vehicle which combines these two technologies we’d greatly benefit from increased mobility, allowing us to respond to situational developments with better flexibility and speed."

 BRZ_reencourage_artillery_development:0 "Reignite the Bronze Forge"
 BRZ_reencourage_artillery_development_desc:0 "The Bronze Forge was originally designed to be the central armoury for all of Bronzehill’s military needs. However, the limited scope of our army, and the lack of interest in exporting arms, meant the forge was closed in favour of importing arms from Griffenheim. However, In the face of our current crisis, it’s become paramount to reignite the forges and produce our own domestic weaponry."

 BRZ_light_artillery:0 "Light Artillery"
 BRZ_light_artillery_desc:0 "Our mountainous and hilly terrain creates an environment of many tight crevice and narrow ridges in which traditional guns could get jammed and bogged down. By investing in alternative materials and design methods we can slim down our weapons with only a minor reduction in calibre. These new lighter guns would then be ideally suited for such rugged terrain."

 BRZ_heavy_artillery:0 "Heavy Artillery"
 BRZ_heavy_artillery_desc:0 "At one time, the Bronze Forge had a reputation for producing truly impressive guns with calibres far larger than anything else in Griffonia. This reputation is just waiting to be reclaimed, under the ideal of building bigger, better, and more effective artillery. If properly deployed it could prove a decisive factor in strengthening our defenses."

 BRZ_high_altitued_training:0 "Guerilla Training"
 BRZ_high_altitued_training_desc:0 "In the face of invasion, our forces are expected to retreat into the mountains of Crownspike. Fighting here will be based less on traditional methods of war and be more focused on hit and run, ambush, and guerilla tactics. As such, it’s important that our forces are trained in the skills necessary to wage a successful guerilla campaign."

 BRZ_expand_the_gunforges:0 "Expand the Bronzekreuz Forges"
 BRZ_expand_the_gunforges_desc:0 "For decades, weapon production within Bronzehill has been extremely limited with only a few state operated factories producing a limited quantity of ammunition and licensed rifles. However, in the face of growing uncertainty, our government has earmarked funding to drastically increase the productivity of these factories in order to supply our growing needs."

 BRZ_support_company_intergration:0 "Bronzehill Corp of Engineers"
 BRZ_support_company_intergration_desc:0 "The Bronzehill Corp of Engineers is a branch of the army which specializes in a number of niche combat duties such as maintaining vehicles, providing logistical services, and aiding in general engineering projects. By further integrating these units into our frontline divisions we would see improved communication and provision of services in the conflict ahead."

 BRZ_licence_guns:0 "Bronzehill-Griffenheim Accords"
 BRZ_licence_guns_desc:0 "The Bronzehill-Griffenheim Accords are a series of treaties rooted in the deep connection between our two nations. While these accords cover a variety of topics, one of the most respected is the accord relating to military cooperation. In it, our government is promised protection, cooperation between forces, and the freedom to buy imperial weapon designs."

 BRZ_farwoof_studdies:0 "Far Woof Defence Network"
 BRZ_farwoof_studdies_desc:0 "Far Woof is the informal nickname given by many within Bronzehill’s military elite to RADAR technology. While our use of the technology is rather limited, with only a few experimental units, advisors from our Griffon allies assure us that the mountains of our nation would be the ideal location to develop a long-range RADAR-based detection network."

 BRZ_estabilish_the_air_corpes:0 "Establish the Bronzehill Imperial Air Force"
 BRZ_estabilish_the_air_corpes_desc:0 "Diamonds Dogs have always been a landlocked species, unable to traverse the skies. Throughout our history that has put us at a disadvantage as the winged pegasus and griffons have struck mercilessly at us from the safety of the sky. However, recent technological innovation has allowed us to overcome our natural limitation and fight within the air as equals."

 BRZ_heavy_airframes:0 "Arthur Terrier Doctrine"
 BRZ_heavy_airframes_desc:0 "Arthur Terrier is a military theorist who claims that the focus of an air force should primarily be on targeting enemy cities with bombers, dropping massive payloads on industrial targets. He states that the focus of aircraft development should be primarily on bombers and the long-range fighters needed to support them in the field."

 BRZ_light_airframes:0 "Richard Barker Doctrine"
 BRZ_light_airframes_desc:0 "Richard Barker is a military theorist who claims that the focus of an air force should primarily be on providing air support to ground units. In order to achieve this goal, he claims that our air force should focus upon aircraft designed for close air support roles and the shorter-range fighters needed to support them."

 BRZ_paratroopers:0 "The 82nd 'Grounded Griffons' Battalion"
 BRZ_paratroopers_desc:0 "The 82nd Battalion is a unit of some renown, known for its fierce devotion to protecting our border with Firtree. The griffon advisors attached the unit, claimed that these dogs could fight with the valour of a grounded griffons, garnering the unit its nickname. Recent developments in aircraft doctrine and design have finally given the 82nd a chance to return to the sky."

 BRZ_flying_artillery:0 "Airborne Artillery"
 BRZ_flying_artillery_desc:0 "A bomb is very much like an artillery shell, being a mixture of high explosives and gunpowder wrapped up nicely in a metal casing. Hell, both of them even rain from the sky, meaning they are virtually the same to the enemy unlucky enough to encounter them. Greater investment from our production resources into bomb building would see higher yields and increased reliability."

 BRZ_air_forges:0 "The Bronzehill Aircraft Factory"
 BRZ_air_forges_desc:0 "In this era of modern war, it has become vitally important to finance the research, development, and production of aircraft for combat. To support in this endeavour our government has financed the construction of the Bronzehill Aircraft Factory, a facility which will specialize in the efficient construction of our military aircraft."

 BRZ_rocket_experiments:0 "The Var-Silfur Research Facility"
 BRZ_rocket_experiments_desc:0 "Var-Silfur is a town nestled in the mountains of Crownspike, being nearly impossible to access through conventional means. Our military has recommended that we construct a research facility here, using it to research experimental technologies while also being safe from the interference of enemy spies and saboteurs."

 BRZ_reforme_the_bronze_council_desc:0 "In times of crisis, the Count has a duty to his dogs to form the Bronze Council, a body of the nation’s ministers, nobles, and leading figures. This body works towards guiding the nation through troubled times, with the Count acting as the figure overseeing debates and dialog. With the Emperor dead and his empire on the brink of civil war, Count Ignatius Bronzehill must perform this duty."

 BRZ_go_with_gabriela:0 "Stand with Gabriela"
 BRZ_go_with_gabriela_desc:0 "As tensions rise within the imperial court, two factions have emerged in the regency debate. One led by Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw and the other by the Archon Eros VII. The Duchess stands for the traditional order of the empire, as it was under Grover V, respecting the delicate balance in society between the nobility and commoner. As such, it is without question that we should support her claim."

 BRZ_go_with_archon:0 "Stand with the Archon"
 BRZ_go_with_archon_desc:0 "As tensions rise within the imperial court, two factions have emerged in the regency debate. One led by Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw and the other by the Archon Eros VII. The Archon stands as a force of reform within the empire, breaking down the barriers between nobility and commoner, unifying society under a common goal. As such, it is without question that we should support his claim."

 BRZ_denounce_the_false_masters:0 "A Bronzehill Regency"
 BRZ_denounce_the_false_masters_desc:0 "As tensions rise within the imperial court, two factions have emerged in the regency debate. One led by Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw and the other by the Archon Eros VII. However, both factions are simply seeking to promote their own self-interests and agendas. As such, we must stand against these traitors and remember our heritage by providing Grover VI with abled advisors and regents."

 # Political - Harmony/Gabriela # 

 BRZ_reformation_act:0 "Formalize the Bronze Council"
 BRZ_reformation_act_desc:0 "Traditionally the Bronze Council is supposed to exist as a temporary body used to deal with a temporary problem. Yet, as the current crisis deepens, it has become apparent that it will take many years to deal with. As such, the Bronze Council must become a formalized institution with a constitution drafted in order to give it legal status and the ability to assist in governance."

 BRZ_lift_political_restrictions:0 "Open the Bronze Council"
 BRZ_lift_political_restrictions_desc:0 "The Bronze Council has always been an aristocratic body, representing the interests of the landed elite. However, the overwhelming majority of our population is not represented, ranging from miners, to farmers, to wealthy merchants. All of them desire a voice within this new Bronze Council and we should seek to reform it to be more inclusive."

 BRZ_first_elections:0 "The First Election"

 BRZ_found_bronzetech_desc:0 "The mountains of Bronzehill are rich in silica and copper. Previously, these minerals were shipped south to Griffenheim where they’d be processed into radios and other electronics before being sold back to us.

 BRZ_estabilish_the_office_of_the_prime_minister:0 "Establish the Office of Prime Minister"
 BRZ_estabilish_the_office_of_the_prime_minister_desc:0 "The increasing intricacy of the Bronze Council has led to Count Bronzetail forming the post of Prime Minister, an office which will take on the leadership role previously held by the Count himself. The duty of the Prime Minister is to lead the council and govern it effectively. As the leader of the largest party, Winston Coppertail was a natural first choice for this post."

 ### EVENTS ###
 bronzehill.1.t:0 "A Messenger in the Night"
 bronzehill.1.d:0 "Count Ignatius' paws gripped tightly into his wooden throne. There had to be some mistake. Or perhaps this was just some cruel joke? He stared down at the griffon messenger who remained bowed at the foot of his throne. He wore a simple black cloak, held around him by an Imperial broach. One given to out by Emperor himself.\n\nThe pit that had opened in his stomach only grew wider. It can't be true. It just can't.\n\n\"Say it again,\" he said. His throat was dry and each word was a painful, breathless gasp.\n\n\"My Lord,\" the messenger said. \"The Emperor. He's...\"\n\nDead. The word hung in Count Ignatius' mind like a ball in flight. The throne creaked under his grip. No, it can't be true. How could the Emperor die? He was always there just like the sun and the moon. Without him there would be no world. There would be no light, no beauty, no fun play times. How could there be without him?\n\nCount Ignatius couldn't feel his own heart anymore. It was as if it some unseen being had ripped it out of his chest, leaving only an inky black void in his place. His essence of life and very soul had vanished with the messenger's words. Perhaps for good.\n\nHe launched himself from his seat, startling the messenger. \"No! You... You lie! It's not true. It can't be true. The Emperor. He can't... He can't be...\"\n\nA rasping choke caught in Count Ignatius' throat. He was on the ground now with his tail between his legs. He didn't know how he had fallen there. It hurt to breath and his eyes burned as if someone had rubbed lime and soap into them. And there was a sound. A pained, unnatural sound that echoed all around. Like the wails of a million lost souls all crying out in pain.\n\nHis ears stood on ends, fearful of the source, whatever horror it might be. Then he realised it: The sound was coming from his own throat and joined in with a symphony of anguish from all other dogs in his court.\n\nThe Emperor was Dead. And every dog in Bronzehill wept that day."

A great sense of mourning has washed across the populace with all aspects of daily life grinding to a halt.\n\nFactories and mines are reporting mass absences, trains have come to a stop as the dogs needed to run them are too preoccupied, even many shops and services are failing to remain open as shopkeepers and bureaucrats have been left paralyzed.\n\nCount Ignatius Bronzetail has addressed his dogs in these trying times, proclaiming a state of national mourning. Across the nation flags now flutter at half-mast, a position which they are expected to maintain for quite some time."

These stunning rocks are then crafted into a beautiful display which adorns the deceased graves and acts as a reminder of how much they were loved and cherished.\n\nIn the wake of Grover’s death, the dogs of Bronzehill have begun a migration to the capital. Each of them depositing their own collection of gems at the count’s palace. Within a day this collection was impressive, within a week it was majestic, now it’s overwhelming.\n\nCount Ignatius Bronzetail has commissioned the greatest artisans of the county to work together and manufacture these gems into a grand display of our dog’s devotion to the emperor. Already this display has begun to take shape, composed of a beautiful statue of Grover’s likeness with a base that houses a mural which promotes the Emperor’s many accomplishments.\n\nAs it nears completion, we must decide if we should send this to Griffenheim, as a solemn gift to Grover VI, or if it should remain in Bronzekreuz as a monument to our devotion and loyalty to the crown."

While it would no doubt be a glorious addition to the emperor’s tomb, it can not be ignored that this statue would fetch a rather high price amongst art collectors with the money helping to stabilize our budget."

We knew for a fact that it was received in Griffenheim but information on its whereabouts weas left fuzzy as soon as it was tranfered to imperial officials. Days passed and there was no official word from the imperial court.\n\nHowever, a leading Griffenheim capitalist recently hosted a memorial ball, which our ambassador attended. In his report, our ambassador states that he discovered that our memorial was not only in the possession of this capitalist but that he had purchased it from government officials for a considerable amount of money.\n\nWhen pressured, the imperial court failed to provide a statement."

 bronzehill.7.t:0 "Bronzehill Nationalizes Imperial Assets"
 bronzehill.7.d:0 "Much of Bronzehill’s industrial, infrastructure, and mining assets are owned and operated by firms based in Griffenheim. This is due to the imperial court having a vested interest in overseeing the economy of Bronzehill for the benefit of its citizens.\n\nHowever, recently there has been talk of nationalizing these assets, with claims of mismanagement and that not enough economic benefit remains in Bronzehill. If this course of action is allowed to reach its conclusion this would mean a massive loss of monetary assets by some of our leading firms.\n\nCurrently the imperial court is divided between approaching this diplomatically, and issuing a strongly worded protest against our vassal, and taking a more forceful approach which would see us deliver a militarized reminder of our dominance."
 bronzehill.7.a:0 "We are busy with more pressing matters, let them nationalize"
 bronzehill.7.b:0 "Send a strongly worded protest"

 bronzehill.8.t:0 "Griffenheim Protests our Nationalization"

In it, Grover VI and his ministers discuss how they are disappointed that we are taking this course of action and beseech us to think twice before progressing with it. Grover VI also brought up how he has always known of our loyalty to him and knows that we will never let him down in these trying times."
 bronzehill.8.a:0 "What have we done?"
 bronzehill.8.b:0 "No, this is the right course of action. He'll see it someday."

 bronzehill.9.t:0 "Military Action Taken"
 bronzehill.9.d:0 "In the face of our nationalization, the capitalists of Griffenheim have gotten their wish. The emperor has given royal consent to an invasion of our domains, in order to secure imperial economic assets. Already, troops are being amassed on our border and skirmishes have broken out between our border guards and troops of the Imperial Army.\n\nIt’s expected that this upcoming invasion will end swiftly in our defeat.\n\nMay the gods have mercy upon us."
