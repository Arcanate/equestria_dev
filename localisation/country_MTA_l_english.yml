 ### FOCUS ###
 MTA_after_storm_king:0 "The Passing of the Storm"
 MTA_after_storm_king_desc:0 "As the dust settles from the Storm King, it is clear that we have taken heavy damage. Several cities and strongholds have been levelled and burned to the ground, and where there once were bustling markets and research facilities now lie only ruins and abandoned debris.\n\nIf we are to continue the CSI, we must rebuild."
 MTA_gather_wayward_agents:0 "Contact Wayward Agents"
 MTA_gather_wayward_agents_desc:0 "As the Storm King raged through the continent, the archives and communication stations were destroyed, stranding several teams of agents around the world. Though many of them have since found themselves independent livings, there are also many that we need to call back, for their expertise, if nothing else."
 MTA_reorganize_research_teams:0 "Reorganize Mission Team Structure"
 MTA_reorganize_research_teams_desc:0 "Before, the teams that we sent out were ad-hoc and largely put together whenever we needed a team for a purpose. With the changing times, this cannot continue. We need to fundamentally restructure our mission teams so that they are equipped to handle whatever comes their way."
 MTA_slacken_recruitment:0 "Slacken Recruitment Procedures"
 MTA_slacken_recruitment_desc:0 "As much as we may dislike it, we cannot continue on not even half strength of personnel. Though the protocols for recruiting new agents and analysts are strict, they may be too strict for the time that we now find ourselves in. Not just due to the fact that people are getting smarter, but just as well due to so many dead."
 MTA_restore_outreach_office:0 "Restore the Outreach Office"
 MTA_restore_outreach_office_desc:0 "Though the Initiative usually operates in secret, it does have one interface with the rest of the world. The Outreach Office officially operates in a wierd limbo between a number of private organizations and the Magocracy. In reality, those are but fronts for the Initiative to communicate with other powers for their cooperation. And as we get back on our hooves, we will need everyone to know it."
 MTA_consolidate_mareib_core:0 "Consolidate the Mareib Stronghold"
 MTA_consolidate_mareib_core_desc:0 "Mareib has always been the core of the Initiative and the Magocracy as a whole. With the Storm King's rage, however, large parts are in ruins and will need rebuilidng. After all, now is the day and now is the hour to rebuild what was lost and make it greater than before."
 MTA_restore_order_marekalla:0 "Ascend to Marekalla's Mountains"
 MTA_restore_order_marekalla_desc:0 "As the Storm King raged through the Maretanian lands, bandits and robbers took over the Marekalla Mountains. Even if they are irrelevant in the long run, the fact that we may need to establish bases there at a later date to handle our operations makes clearing them out a necessity. With force, if we must."
 MTA_restore_order_beihoof:0 "Clear Out the Beihoof Forests"
 MTA_restore_order_beihoof_desc:0 "As with Marekalla, so with Beihoof. Not only does this pose a good place to contain artifacts that rely on nature in some way, the forests themselves also make for good cover from any airplanes, pegasi or hippogrifs getting the bright idea to fly over without us needing to bring out the flak."
 MTA_provisional_code:0 "Provisional Code on Civilian Contact"
 MTA_provisional_code_desc:0 ""
 MTA_feed_impoverished:0 "Feed the Impoverished"
 MTA_feed_impoverished_desc:0 ""
 MTA_analysis_committee:0 "The Committee for Analysis"
 MTA_analysis_committee_desc:0 "One of the old organs of the CSI has been the Committee for Analysis. Pouring through tomes and books, old and new to find new artifacts to gather, as well as analyzing the results for further use, they are the drivers of data in the Initiative. It is high time that it is restored to its full glory."
 MTA_scientific_solutions:0 "Scientific Solutions"
 MTA_scientific_solutions_desc:0 ""
 MTA_open_the_cave:0 "The Cave"
 MTA_open_the_cave_desc:0 "Finally, we have reestablished control of Maretania and have gathered enough resources and equipment to pursue our goal for so long, to open the Cave and to restart our primary activities."
 
 MTA_steam_and_stone:0 "An Age of Steam and Stone"
 MTA_steam_and_stone_desc:0 "It is indeed a new age. An age of magic and machines, of fire and steam. And though the old ways have served us well, there are also many new inventions in the world that we can make use of in our activities. We may be old, but we are not idiots."
 MTA_blacksite_industry:0 "Industrial Blacksites"
 MTA_blacksite_industry_desc:0 "Many mountain valleys and desolate fields lie unused around Maretania. Without any prying eyes looking too close at our activities, we have an excellent opportunity to establish several sites around Maretania that can silently and quietly develop new technologies for our purposes without anyone noticing."
 MTA_grease_free_market:0 "Grease the Wheels of the Market"
 MTA_grease_free_market_desc:0 ""
 MTA_crystal_cave_mines:0 "Caves to Crystal Mines"
 MTA_crystal_cave_mines_desc:0 ""
 MTA_crystal_electrification:0 "Crystal-Fueled Electrification"
 MTA_crystal_electrification_desc:0 ""
 MTA_shadow_wealth_distribution:0 "Shadow Wealth Distribution"
 MTA_shadow_wealth_distribution_desc:0 "The Bank of Maretania. Officially a rather neutral affair with a single branch office in Flowena and an unassuming headquarters in Mareib. Not told is the massive network of industries, laboratories and companies that it controls on behalf of the Council. A place to discreetly move funding around without nosy inspectors looking around."
 MTA_literacy_agency:0 "Civilian Literacy Development Teams"
 MTA_literacy_agency_desc:0 ""
 MTA_experimentation_code:0 "Code on Applied Research"
 MTA_experimentation_code_desc:0 ""

 MTA_magical_manufactures:0 "Magical Manufactures"
 MTA_magical_manufactures_desc:0 ""
 
 MTA_service_for_the_world:0 "Serve the Good of the World"
 MTA_service_for_the_world_desc:0 "The artifacts, useful as they may be are too dangerous to be left. The Idol of Boreas was bad enough, but what if an even more powerful artifact appeared or someone was able to break into the cave? The armed forces of the CSI serve not for imperialism or conquest - but to make sure that this does not happen, ever. For the good of the world."
 
 MTA_containment_path:0 "Security and Containment"
 MTA_containment_path_desc:0 "For several decades, we have been protecting and securing artifacts across the world. Even if it has cost lives, and we have been forced into hard choices, we must stand firm on our principles, and continue on this path, and some day, maybe, we will get useful results that we can better the world with. Hopefully."
 

 ### IDEAS ###
 MTA_CSI:0 "Containment and Security Initiative"
 MTA_CSI_desc:0 "Maretania is the home of the Containment and Security Initiative, a worldwide underground operation to investigate, capture and secure powerful magical artifacts to make sure that they remain in responsible hooves. Strike forces serving the CSI consist of powerful trained mages who can take on platoons by themselves. Even then, it has been weakened by the Storm King’s recent rampage."
 MTA_code_on_civil_contact:0 "Code on Civilian Contact"
 MTA_code_on_civil_contact_desc:0 "Do not incite unnecessary conflict. Do not disclose any information about your actions above allowed parameters. Do not allow any contact with the Artifacts."
 MTA_national_industrial_policy:0 "Civilian Development Initiative"
 MTA_national_industrial_policy_desc:0 "To continue to provide the Containment and Security Initiative with resources and armament, a section of the CSI's bureaucracy will be dedicated to the development of Maretania's economy and industry. Through any means, open or clandestine, we shall transform Maretania into a modern industrial economy."
 MTA_technological_supremacy:0 "Technological Supremacy"
 MTA_technological_supremacy_desc:0 "Our scientists and engineers are the most innovative in the planet, and always come up with the right solution to any issue which the CSI presents them."

 MTA_artifact_experimentation_category_desc:0 "The Containment and Security Initiative swears it as its duty to protect the rest of the world from powerful artifacts and magical entities. Its discretion lies in not just capturing these artifacts, however, but also in identifying the full extent of their abilities, figuring out their level of threat, and finally containing them. In this decision category, you can choose to §HExperiment On§! or §HActivate§! captured artifacts to study the full extent of their abilities, and §HSecure§! them to forever keep them away from society.\n\nVisit the §HPolitics§! tab to access §HThe Cave§! and its held Artifacts."

 ### EVENTS ###
 
 maretania.0.t:0 "The Ruins of Something Great."
 maretania.0.d:0 "The ruins were strewn around the different buildings, large pieces of debris littering the streets. Several pillars of smoke, black, from the burning of furniture and varying wooden flotsam and jetsam lying around as opposed to the previous heartbeat of steam and power. And yet, there was still life in the streets. Two horses, one a unicorn, one not walked through the streets, each wearing a white tunic, with a gold pin at the right shoulder.\n\n"You really think that this the end of the CSI? That the Storm King did so much damage, Dr. Mushriq?"\n\nThe unicorn trudged along, before stopping at a particularly large building, holes in it still visible, even if it had been repaired intermittedly with wood and nails. "Look at it. Two years, but still nothing. What is this meant to be, Dr. Altarus?"\n\nDr. Altarus looked at the building, before taking the few steps over to it and putting a hoof on the wall, feeling the masonry, "The start of something new. We may be bloodied, but we are unbowed. We still have the caves, right?"\n\n"We do. And the agents are still out there."\n\n"See, there is plenty of opportunity left." Dr. Altarus turned around and then looked up at the building again, bits of debris hanging on by a few threads. "We do still have to do something about this building though. And soon.""
 maretania.0.a:0 "Could we get some masons over here?"
 
 maretania.1.t:0 "Cracking Open the Cave"
 maretania.1.d:0 "Tools were spread all over the floor, machines, powered by steam and magic alike standing around the doors. Decorated with ornate inscriptions, and crystals, one could easily mistake such a door for belonging in the most holy of sanctums. And yet, it was a door out of the way, a long way from everything.\n\nPerfect for hiding the artifacts that the world has forgotten then.\n\nDr. Altarus looked over the whole spectacle, of zebras and horses milling about below, carefully noting the equipment not damaging the door.\n\n"A long time left?" Dr. Mushriq asked as he climbed the stairs to the platform, taking care to not trip over the tunic or the tall steps on the way up\n\nDr. Altarus looked back at Dr. Mushriq, briefly taking his look off the cave, "Not quite long. We are finally cracking the spells our colleagues put on the door when they sealed themselves in. Hopefully, everything is still there."\n\n"They sealed themselves in. And no one's been in there ever since. Least of all the looters." Dr. Mushriq answered, pointing to the door, still hermetically shut and locked.\n\n"I know, maybe it's just nerves. We still have a ways to go before we are back in business, even with Al Rabina getting everything under control finally." he said, before turning back to look down at the milieu below.\n\nDr. Mushriq joned the Dr. Altarus at the platform, leaning at the railing, "And what then? We have our artifacts, but the world is changing aorund us, and I don't think they are that poite to let us operate unrestricted and without their knowledge. At best it's a protest, at worst, the masquerade is broken, and our agents are shot."\n\n"We are many things, Dr. Mushriq, but we are not stuck in the past. We will find new ways around it. Even if we have to find completely new ways."\n\nAs those words fell, a mighty creak was heard from the doors, the crystals glowing a bright blue, before the doors slowly opened. Bit by bit, ever so slowly, the massive double doors moved aside to reveal the thing that so many had died and lied to protect. Rows upon rows of crates, boxes and bells. All containing an artifact of power. All a part of the CSI. All something to be contained and protected, lest the security of the world itself would come at risk."
 maretania.1.a:0 "Now for the real work."
 
 maretania.2.t:0 "The Committee for Analysis"
 maretania.2.d:0 "Many buildings had been left desolate once the Storm came. Many more were destroyed. And yet, life still goes on. Horses, mages and non-mages. CSI Agents and non-agents had begun to return to the cities, busy working on restoring the buildings. And in one, non-descript room in the middle of Mareib, a small circle of mages were gathered.\n\n"So what was it that you called us here for Dr. Miftah?" a unicorn asked, his tagelmust largely dusted up from the work going on outside.\n\n"It's very simple, Dr. Huquq", Dr. Miftah answered, putting a heavy tome on the table, kicking up dust "New ideas have spread, and they might be of interest."\n\nDr. Huquq looked over at the tome, reading on the title. 'The Governance of Severnaya'. She looked to Dr. Miftah, who merely nodded. "Socialism? That strange thing from Equus?"\n\nDr. Miftah opened the tome, browsing through the various "The same. The Committee has always been for analysis to keep the worst parts of the CSI in check. This is the answer. Don't forget all those outside the CSI we have to take care of."\n\nDr. Huquq sighed, noting down a few sentences on a piece of paper. "I'll look into it, but remember that for now, we are not going to make a move. For now, we maintain our job. Analyzing the reports that come in from around the Initiative and taking action whenever someone does something contrary to our goals. Secure, Contain and Protect." With those words, she rose, catching Dr. Miftah by surprise.\n\n"But doesn't this prove promising? A way to provide for everyone and make sure that we can continue to nudge the Initiative in the right direction?" he asked, just as she prepared to trot out the door.\n\nShe sighed and looked back. "I'll read the book, and think about it. Just don't go too loudly about it," she said, levitating over the book, hiding it under her clothing."
 maretania.2.a:0 "Maybe one day, it will come to pass"
 
 maretania.3.t:0 "The Outreach Office"
 maretania.3.d:0 "There were many things that the CSI and the Magocracy in general were good, indeed, very good at, but interacting with other nations were not really their forte. That fell to the Outreach Office. \n\nThe meeting rooms in the Site also tended to be spartan, the complete reversal of the rest of the world. The lack of the trappings in the room was clearly noted by the Committee as they entered the room. "What is all this for Director Alqatat? We have our hooves full as it is with trying to reestablish the barest lines of communication with our agents." one of the agents in the room exclaimed almost immediately after they were sitting at the table, a bottle of bitter on the table.\n\nThe Director repressed the instinct to fill up a glass and take something strong while explaining. "It's very simple Agent Duyujayn. We are between two powers who are taking advantage of the situation. And we must be ready to steer the Initiative in the direction beneficial to us." he said, while fiddling with a slide projector, a small stack of slides already sitting in a box beside it.\n\nThe agent nodded along, before levitating the bottle over and pouring himself a glass. "And what about the Analysis Committee? Or Command? Can't imagine they'll be pleased about us taking control."\n\n"Let me take care of them. The ruleset of the Initiative is more convoluted than the tunnels in the Caves. We can find a way to take control if the time comes." Director Alqatat mused, finally getting the projector to work, showing a map of the region around the Arabian Sea. "This is what we're looking at. And if we can get enough support from both, we can be in the driver's seat. Everyone. This is an unparalleled opportunity"\n\nAgent Duyujayn at the map, before taking stock of the situation, "You are sure that this won't backfire on us?"\n\nThe Director looked up at the map, and then to the Agent. "Of course not.""
 maretania.3.a:0 "Surely not."
 
 marcsi.1.t:0 "Action with [FROM.GetMTAArtifactNameDec]"
 marcsi.1.d:0 "[FROM.GetMTAArtifactNameDec] has been retrieved from its containment within the Cave and the leadership of the CSI gathers to decide on what they want to do with the chosen artifact. The ancient, mysterious items brought to custody in Maretania leave many itching for experimentation, perhaps even activation of the artifacts at their hooves - after all, to contain and protect the artifacts necessitates collecting information on exactly how they need to be contained. There is always a risk involved when dealing with such magical power, however.\n\nFor you, Director, there are several options to take.\n\nYou may order a disposable employee to try to activate the artifact. If the CSI has any instructions on how the artifact is used, they will be put to effect, otherwise, the employee will be ordered to carefully attempt one of several standard artifact activation procedures. With how unpredictable the effects may be, however, this is a risky approach.\n\nPerhaps, before resorting to that, you may order careful experimentation on the artifact first. Using state of the art technology and procedures such as strength tests or exposure to certain chemicals, we can predict what the artifact might do once activated, and so more easily guess whether it should be touched or sealed away forever.\n\nFinally, you may order the artifact to be secured, sealed away forever in one of the Cave's vaults, to ensure that it will never cause harm to anyone nor see the light of day."
