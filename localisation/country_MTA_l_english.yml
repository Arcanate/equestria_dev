 ### FOCUS ###
 MTA_after_storm_king:0 "The Passing of the Storm"
 MTA_after_storm_king_desc:0 "As the dust settles from the Storm King, it is clear that we have taken heavy damage. Several cities and strongholds have been levelled and burned to the ground, and where there once were bustling markets and research facilities now lie only ruins and abandoned debris.\n\nIf we are to continue the CSI, we must rebuild."
 MTA_gather_wayward_agents:0 "Contact Wayward Agents"
 MTA_gather_wayward_agents_desc:0 "As the Storm King raged through the continent, the archives and communication stations were destroyed, stranding several teams of agents around the world. Though many of them have since found themselves independent livings, there are also many that we need to call back, for their expertise, if nothing else."
 MTA_reorganize_research_teams:0 "Reorganize Mission Team Structure"
 MTA_reorganize_research_teams_desc:0 "Before, the teams that we sent out were ad-hoc and largely put together whenever we needed a team for a purpose. With the changing times, this cannot continue. We need to fundamentally restructure our mission teams so that they are equipped to handle whatever comes their way."
 MTA_slacken_recruitment:0 "Slacken Recruitment Procedures"
 MTA_slacken_recruitment_desc:0 "As much as we may dislike it, we cannot continue on not even half strength of personnel. Though the protocols for recruiting new agents and analysts are strict, they may be too strict for the time that we now find ourselves in. Not just due to the fact that people are getting smarter, but just as well due to so many dead."
 MTA_restore_outreach_office:0 "Restore the Outreach Office"
 MTA_restore_outreach_office_desc:0 "Though the Initiative usually operates in secret, it does have one interface with the rest of the world. The Outreach Office officially operates in a wierd limbo between a number of private organizations and the Magocracy. In reality, those are but fronts for the Initiative to communicate with other powers for their cooperation. And as we get back on our hooves, we will need everyone to know it."
 MTA_consolidate_mareib_core:0 "Consolidate the Mareib Stronghold"
 MTA_consolidate_mareib_core_desc:0 "Mareib has always been the core of the Initiative and the Magocracy as a whole. With the Storm King's rage, however, large parts are in ruins and will need rebuilidng. After all, now is the day and now is the hour to rebuild what was lost and make it greater than before."
 MTA_restore_order_marekalla:0 "Ascend to Marekalla's Mountains"
 MTA_restore_order_marekalla_desc:0 "As the Storm King raged through the Maretanian lands, bandits and robbers took over the Marekalla Mountains. Even if they are irrelevant in the long run, the fact that we may need to establish bases there at a later date to handle our operations makes clearing them out a necessity. With force, if we must."
 MTA_restore_order_beihoof:0 "Clear Out the Beihoof Forests"
 MTA_restore_order_beihoof_desc:0 "As with Marekalla, so with Beihoof. Not only does this pose a good place to contain artifacts that rely on nature in some way, the forests themselves also make for good cover from any airplanes, pegasi or hippogrifs getting the bright idea to fly over without us needing to bring out the flak."
 MTA_provisional_code:0 "Provisional Code on Civilian Contact"
 MTA_provisional_code_desc:0 "Though the Initiative remains the primary driver of the Magocracy, missions and pinpoint strikes don't happen without the goods produced in publicly visible facilities. And though the Initiative must remain secret to the world at large, it still poses the problem of the need for civilians every once in a while. We need some way to guide the interactions. A code."
 MTA_feed_impoverished:0 "Feed the Impoverished"
 MTA_feed_impoverished_desc:0 "'The Army Marches On Its Stomach'\nSomeone once said it about the military. And though it rings true for the military, it also rings just as true in the civillian life. Though we have our own food supplies, the broad population of Maretania can barely feed themselves. Feeding them would not only provide a support base, but also gain us a better workforce."
 MTA_analysis_committee:0 "The Committee for Analysis"
 MTA_analysis_committee_desc:0 "One of the old organs of the CSI has been the Committee for Analysis. Pouring through tomes and books, old and new to find new artifacts to gather, as well as analyzing the results for further use, they are the drivers of data in the Initiative. It is high time that it is restored to its full glory."
 MTA_scientific_solutions:0 "Scientific Solutions"
 MTA_scientific_solutions_desc:0 "Magic and spells are flashy and they do a lot for the Magocracy. But the times are changing and we need to change with them lest we be left in the dust that the march of progress is kicking up. No. The Committee for Analysis must get involved in this and in time, come up with the new solutions for how we can best utilize our meager resources."
 MTA_open_the_cave:0 "The Cave"
 MTA_open_the_cave_desc:0 "Finally, we have reestablished control of Maretania and have gathered enough resources and equipment to pursue our goal for so long, to open the Cave and to restart our primary activities."
 
 MTA_steam_and_stone:0 "An Age of Steam and Stone"
 MTA_steam_and_stone_desc:0 "It is indeed a new age. An age of magic and machines, of fire and steam. And though the old ways have served us well, there are also many new inventions in the world that we can make use of in our activities. We may be old, but we are not idiots."
 MTA_blacksite_industry:0 "Industrial Blacksites"
 MTA_blacksite_industry_desc:0 "Many mountain valleys and desolate fields lie unused around Maretania. Without any prying eyes looking too close at our activities, we have an excellent opportunity to establish several sites around Maretania that can silently and quietly develop new technologies for our purposes without anyone noticing."
 MTA_grease_free_market:0 "Grease the Wheels of the Market"
 MTA_grease_free_market_desc:0 "Even if we are to remain in control when all is said and done, we cannot micromanage the economy down to the smallest tidbit. The crux lies in the smallholders. The owners of a single factory or the family farm. Those that have been in the business for a generation that we need to encourage. Agents will be sent around on campaigns to get the market going."
 MTA_crystal_cave_mines:0 "Caves to Crystal Mines"
 MTA_crystal_cave_mines_desc:0 "The caves that we once stored the artifacts in before moving them out due to security concerns can still be used. Indeed, the caves are themselves old goldmines before the crystals became relevant for electricity. But they are chock-full of crystals. We just need to clear out the old ceiling and flooring and we will have burgeoning mines on our hooves."
 MTA_crystal_electrification:0 "Crystal-Fueled Electrification"
 MTA_crystal_electrification_desc:0 "There are many things crystals are good for. Storing magic. Expelling magic, and a new invention, transferring magic. Crystal powder in cables with silver or copper can give an extremely effective transfer of power. Just like in Equestria. The electrification, bound no longer by power plants on every street corner can go ahead."
 MTA_shadow_wealth_distribution:0 "Shadow Wealth Distribution"
 MTA_shadow_wealth_distribution_desc:0 "The Bank of Maretania. Officially a rather neutral affair with a single branch office in Flowena and an unassuming headquarters in Mareib. Not told is the massive network of industries, laboratories and companies that it controls on behalf of the Council. A place to discreetly move funding around without nosy inspectors looking around."
 MTA_literacy_agency:0 "Civilian Literacy Development Teams"
 MTA_literacy_agency_desc:0 "To build a strong nation, you must start from the bottom. The ABCs and 123s. This is where we come in. With a distressing few number of people in Maretania that can actually read and write outside of the Initiative, we need to create a homegrown literary population. The old ways of relying on the outside world for skilled mages cannot be go on with hostile powers everywhere."
 MTA_experimentation_code:0 "Code on Applied Research"
 MTA_experimentation_code_desc:0 "There are some fields that are just too dangerous to go around in without adequate protection. And other fields that one should not be stepped in unless one can present 47 stamped and signed forms that indicate that, yes, they can do this. This has been ad-hoc, but with the recent changes, it is high time to formalize this into a codified set of rules."
 MTA_induct_new_scientists:0 "Induct Talented Youth"
 MTA_induct_new_scientists_desc:0 "Talent is what science runs on. Around Maretania, numerous talented bright young things are developing their faculties, looking around the world and wondering what lies beyond. Unfortunately, many of those are lost on the floor as they cannot afford the education necessary and are forced to work for meager pay. And we must stop this cycle. For nothing else, ourselves."
 MTA_magical_manufactures:0 "Magical Manufactures"
 MTA_magical_manufactures_desc:0 "Lastly, the manufacturies are the key to it all. Without the lamps, the paper or even the chairs, the Initiative is nothing. As it stands, they are mostly dancing to our tune, whenever we need something. Still, it is only right for something in return. Upgrading the machine tools used. Connected to electricity, they need not their own large power source, when we provide to them."

 MTA_service_for_the_world_desc:0 "The artifacts, useful as they may be are too dangerous to be left. The Idol of Boreas was bad enough, but what if an even more powerful artifact appeared or someone was able to break into the cave? The armed forces of the CSI serve not for imperialism or conquest - but to make sure that this does not happen, ever. For the good of the world."

 ### IDEAS ###

 ### EVENTS ###
 
 maretania.0.t:0 "The Ruins of Something Great."
 maretania.0.d:0 "The ruins were strewn around the different buildings, large pieces of debris littering the streets. Several pillars of smoke, black, from the burning of furniture and varying wooden flotsam and jetsam lying around as opposed to the previous heartbeat of steam and power. And yet, there was still life in the streets. Two horses, one a unicorn, one not walked through the streets, each wearing a white tunic, with a gold pin at the right shoulder.\n\n"You really think that this the end of the CSI? That the Storm King did so much damage, Dr. Mushriq?"\n\nThe unicorn trudged along, before stopping at a particularly large building, holes in it still visible, even if it had been repaired intermittedly with wood and nails. "Look at it. Two years, but still nothing. What is this meant to be, Dr. Altarus?"\n\nDr. Altarus looked at the building, before taking the few steps over to it and putting a hoof on the wall, feeling the masonry, "The start of something new. We may be bloodied, but we are unbowed. We still have the caves, right?"\n\n"We do. And the agents are still out there."\n\n"See, there is plenty of opportunity left." Dr. Altarus turned around and then looked up at the building again, bits of debris hanging on by a few threads. "We do still have to do something about this building though. And soon.""
 maretania.0.a:0 "Could we get some masons over here?"
 
 maretania.1.t:0 "Cracking Open the Cave"
 maretania.1.d:0 "Tools were spread all over the floor, machines, powered by steam and magic alike standing around the doors. Decorated with ornate inscriptions, and crystals, one could easily mistake such a door for belonging in the most holy of sanctums. And yet, it was a door out of the way, a long way from everything.\n\nPerfect for hiding the artifacts that the world has forgotten then.\n\nDr. Altarus looked over the whole spectacle, of zebras and horses milling about below, carefully noting the equipment not damaging the door.\n\n"A long time left?" Dr. Mushriq asked as he climbed the stairs to the platform, taking care to not trip over the tunic or the tall steps on the way up\n\nDr. Altarus looked back at Dr. Mushriq, briefly taking his look off the cave, "Not quite long. We are finally cracking the spells our colleagues put on the door when they sealed themselves in. Hopefully, everything is still there."\n\n"They sealed themselves in. And no one's been in there ever since. Least of all the looters." Dr. Mushriq answered, pointing to the door, still hermetically shut and locked.\n\n"I know, maybe it's just nerves. We still have a ways to go before we are back in business, even with Al Rabina getting everything under control finally." he said, before turning back to look down at the milieu below.\n\nDr. Mushriq joned the Dr. Altarus at the platform, leaning at the railing, "And what then? We have our artifacts, but the world is changing aorund us, and I don't think they are that poite to let us operate unrestricted and without their knowledge. At best it's a protest, at worst, the masquerade is broken, and our agents are shot."\n\n"We are many things, Dr. Mushriq, but we are not stuck in the past. We will find new ways around it. Even if we have to find completely new ways."\n\nAs those words fell, a mighty creak was heard from the doors, the crystals glowing a bright blue, before the doors slowly opened. Bit by bit, ever so slowly, the massive double doors moved aside to reveal the thing that so many had died and lied to protect. Rows upon rows of crates, boxes and bells. All containing an artifact of power. All a part of the CSI. All something to be contained and protected, lest the security of the world itself would come at risk."
 maretania.1.a:0 "Now for the real work."
 
 maretania.2.t:0 "The Committee for Analysis"
 maretania.2.d:0 "Many buildings had been left desolate once the Storm came. Many more were destroyed. And yet, life still goes on. Horses, mages and non-mages. CSI Agents and non-agents had begun to return to the cities, busy working on restoring the buildings. And in one, non-descript room in the middle of Mareib, a small circle of mages were gathered.\n\n"So what was it that you called us here for Dr. Miftah?" a unicorn asked, his tagelmust largely dusted up from the work going on outside.\n\n"It's very simple, Dr. Huquq", Dr. Miftah answered, putting a heavy tome on the table, kicking up dust "New ideas have spread, and they might be of interest."\n\nDr. Huquq looked over at the tome, reading on the title. 'The Governance of Severnaya'. She looked to Dr. Miftah, who merely nodded. "Socialism? That strange thing from Equus?"\n\nDr. Miftah opened the tome, browsing through the various "The same. The Committee has always been for analysis to keep the worst parts of the CSI in check. This is the answer. Don't forget all those outside the CSI we have to take care of."\n\nDr. Huquq sighed, noting down a few sentences on a piece of paper. "I'll look into it, but remember that for now, we are not going to make a move. For now, we maintain our job. Analyzing the reports that come in from around the Initiative and taking action whenever someone does something contrary to our goals. Secure, Contain and Protect." With those words, she rose, catching Dr. Miftah by surprise.\n\n"But doesn't this prove promising? A way to provide for everyone and make sure that we can continue to nudge the Initiative in the right direction?" he asked, just as she prepared to trot out the door.\n\nShe sighed and looked back. "I'll read the book, and think about it. Just don't go too loudly about it," she said, levitating over the book, hiding it under her clothing."
 maretania.2.a:0 "Maybe one day, it will come to pass"
 
 maretania.3.t:0 "The Outreach Office"
 maretania.3.d:0 "There were many things that the CSI and the Magocracy in general were good, indeed, very good at, but interacting with other nations were not really their forte. That fell to the Outreach Office. \n\nThe meeting rooms in the Site also tended to be spartan, the complete reversal of the rest of the world. The lack of the trappings in the room was clearly noted by the Committee as they entered the room. "What is all this for Director Alqatat? We have our hooves full as it is with trying to reestablish the barest lines of communication with our agents." one of the agents in the room exclaimed almost immediately after they were sitting at the table, a bottle of bitter on the table.\n\nThe Director repressed the instinct to fill up a glass and take something strong while explaining. "It's very simple Agent Duyujayn. We are between two powers who are taking advantage of the situation. And we must be ready to steer the Initiative in the direction beneficial to us." he said, while fiddling with a slide projector, a small stack of slides already sitting in a box beside it.\n\nThe agent nodded along, before levitating the bottle over and pouring himself a glass. "And what about the Analysis Committee? Or Command? Can't imagine they'll be pleased about us taking control."\n\n"Let me take care of them. The ruleset of the Initiative is more convoluted than the tunnels in the Caves. We can find a way to take control if the time comes." Director Alqatat mused, finally getting the projector to work, showing a map of the region around the Arabian Sea. "This is what we're looking at. And if we can get enough support from both, we can be in the driver's seat. Everyone. This is an unparalleled opportunity"\n\nAgent Duyujayn at the map, before taking stock of the situation, "You are sure that this won't backfire on us?"\n\nThe Director looked up at the map, and then to the Agent. "Of course not.""
 maretania.3.a:0 "Surely not."
 
 marcsi.1.t:0 "Action with [FROM.GetMTAArtifactNameDec]"
 marcsi.1.d:0 "[FROM.GetMTAArtifactNameDec] has been retrieved from its containment within the Cave and the leadership of the CSI gathers to decide on what they want to do with the chosen artifact. The ancient, mysterious items brought to custody in Maretania leave many itching for experimentation, perhaps even activation of the artifacts at their hooves - after all, to contain and protect the artifacts necessitates collecting information on exactly how they need to be contained. There is always a risk involved when dealing with such magical power, however.\n\nFor you, Director, there are several options to take.\n\nYou may order a disposable employee to try to activate the artifact. If the CSI has any instructions on how the artifact is used, they will be put to effect, otherwise, the employee will be ordered to carefully attempt one of several standard artifact activation procedures. With how unpredictable the effects may be, however, this is a risky approach.\n\nPerhaps, before resorting to that, you may order careful experimentation on the artifact first. Using state of the art technology and procedures such as strength tests or exposure to certain chemicals, we can predict what the artifact might do once activated, and so more easily guess whether it should be touched or sealed away forever.\n\nFinally, you may order the artifact to be secured, sealed away forever in one of the Cave's vaults, to ensure that it will never cause harm to anyone nor see the light of day."
 marcsi.1.a:0 "Experiment with the artifact."
 marcsi.1.b:0 "Try to activate the artifact."
 marcsi.1.c:0 "Secure the artifact and seal it away."
 
 marcsi.2.t:0 "Artifact Experimentation"
 marcsi.2.d1:0 "Doctors Mushriq and Altarus looked over the small chemistry set, the beakers and vials standing neatly where they were left when the Initiative had secured it those few years ago from De Vluegels.\n\n"You actually think we can activate it and not have it blow up?" Dr. Mushriq mused, pointing to the set. "You know what happened with some of the other artifacts we had to seal away after they blew up in our faces."\n\nDr. Altarus merely cocked his head and grabbed one of the data reports from a nearby table, "We are not here to destroy or file away everything. Sometimes, things turn out for the better for us. Just because we are here to protect the world doesn't mean we can't use the same things every now and then."\n\nA few seconds passed as Dr. Mushriq retreated into the background. "I still disagree with you. This is not something that should be used. We don't even know what it is other than a strange chemistry set."\n\n"And that is why you are not the one in charge of testing." Dr. Altarus mused. "Alright everyone. Power up the machines and let us get to it."\n\n"For the record, Dr. Altarus, I think that trying to exploiting all these artifacts for naked gain for the Initiative is quite a bit against our code. But you're in charge. For now." Dr. Mushriq said as the experimentation began."
 marcsi.2.d2:0 "Two assistants carried a crate into the testing room, hermetically sealed, the exterior betraying no hint as to what hid inside. Dr. Altarus, standing at one of the tables jotted a few words down on the expedition report. "So. A duplicating basket?"\n\n"Indeed," Dr. Miftah answered "The basket should be able to duplicate any foodstuff that you can think of"\n\n"Still? Are we really going to make food from...this?" Dr. Altarus worried, pointing to the basket being taken out of the crate.\n\nDr. Miftah dodged the implications, levitating a few apples and a pie into the basket "Don't worry. We have some volunteers who are willng to take one for the team and eat the first few nuggets out of the basket," she said as she covered the basket with a piece of cloth. "But that's all for later. Right now, I suggest that we go and get dinner because this is going to take some time," and with those words, the two scientists absconded."
 marcsi.2.a:0 "OK."
 
 marcsi.3.t:0 "Artifact Activation"
 marcsi.3.d1:0 "It had been a few hours, mostly of assistants and junior researchers running in and out with buckets of coal dust and water, and then the occasional sealed container of obscurity. As for Dr. Altarus, he had resigned himself to a couch in a breakroom with a pot of coffee or seven, going through them while catching up on the latest paperwork.\n\nA request, a resignation, a request, a mortuary report, a request...Each and every one being standard for a Branch Director in the CSI. It was the not so fun part of being so high up.\n\nHe looked up to see one of the site assistants with a short, newly typed telegram in his telekinesis, floating between them. He grabbed it and read it, the occasional drop of coffee spilling down.\n\nACTIVATION SUCCESSFUL STOP CSI-666 NOW IN OPERATION STOP DR. YAWM\n\nDr. Altarus grabbed a pen from the coffee table and wrote a few quick words on the telegram to be sent back to the laboratory\n\nPut CSI-666 into immediate use for the initiative later with the express purpose for motorized operations - Dr. Altarus."
 marcsi.3.d2:0 "It had been a full day since they had last checked on the basket. Few people indeed had any idea as to how long it would take. Nevertheless, the time had seemingly come to check in on it. Dr. Altarus was the first to arrive, having come off a busy shift overseeing a bunch of assistants. He looked at the basket. Still standing there, unassuming. Pulling off the cloth, on the other hoof, revealed a wealth of food. Dozens of apples and pies in the basket, all looking freshly plucked or baked. He took out one of the apples and took a bite. Succulent and the slight tinge of acid. Just as an apple should be.\n\nAnother apple. And then a pie. Soon, the apple cores and empty trays piled up. He heard the door open, seeing Dr. Miftah enter, her look shifting quickly to one of scepticism and befuddlement.\n\n"And what became of the food now, Dr. Altarus? Would you like to submit a report regarding the possibility of using this for internal purposes"\n\nShe didn't get an answer, Dr. Altarus having fallen asleep in the pile of food."
 marcsi.3.a:0 "OK."
 
 marcsi.4.t:0 "New Artifact"
 marcsi.4.d:0 "The gods Augenis and Void have blessed us with a new artifact! (Test event, will be replaced by artifact scavenging mechanics once I get a good idea on how I wanna go with them)"
 marcsi.4.a:0 "OK."

 MTA_artifact_tab_tt:0 "Open the interface for The Cave"
 MTA_artifact_tab_tt_desc:0 "'The Cave' is an affectionate local name for the vast hidden complexes and storage facilities operated by the Containment and Security Initiative. Here, you may see all the Artifacts held within the facilities, their descriptions, and any additional information discovered about their nature."
 MTA_opened_cave_flag:0 "The Cave is currently accessible."
 
 GetMTAArtifactName_1_tt:0 "CSI-666 "Test Artifact""
 GetMTAArtifactDesc_1_tt:0 "CSI-666 is a testing kit of the model "Kleine Kemiker" retrieved during the Republican Revolution of 979 from the home of -REDACTED-, after agents by chance in the city heard reports of a chemistry set that "made petrol from nothing". After testing, CSI-666 found to produce petrol when heating coal dust mixed with water in one of the flasks in the set. There have been thoughts that this might be used to produce petroleum products for the Initiative once proper testing has been done and logged."
 
 GetMTAArtifactName_2_tt:0 "Artifacts the World Forgot"
 GetMTAArtifactDesc_2_tt:0 "Forever locked doors, shut vaults, and chained boxes, holding an innumerable amount of relics and artifacts which have since been lost to memory. Do the CSI agents following instructions to keep these artifacts hidden know what they can do? Almost certainly not. But orders are orders, and so they will never see the light of day."
 
 GetMTAArtifactName_3_tt:0 "CSI-132 "Tallcrane's Basket""
 GetMTAArtifactDesc_3_tt:0 "CSI-132 is to be placed at the Site 3 Kitchen with no access restrictions exempt being Dr. Altarus.\n\nCSI-132 is a standard basket made of oak measuring 50 cm x 30 cm x 20 cm and weighs 507.4 grammes as of the latest measurement. What makes CSI-132 anormal is that, despite being empty, CSI-132 possesses the ability to duplicate solid consumables (exceptions to this include sauces and soups as well as the containers holding said liquids) over a thirteen-hour period of time. It is not limited to cuisine from its place of retrieval, and has, in testing, produced Rijekan Strukli and Vedinian frikadeller. There seems not to be a limit on the capabilities of the basket, other than 1) It will only duplicate items edible by sentient creatures of the world (See addendum 1a), and 2) It will duplicate items by an exact factor 100.\n\nAddendum 1a) In order to provide for the lab animals, it was attempted to duplicate several herbs not digestible by any known sentient species. After twenty-six (26) hours, no change in amount was detected."

 # TO ADD NEW ARTIFACTS:
 # - Add scripted loc entries in EAW_MTA_scripted_localization, and localize them 
 # - Modify events marcsi.2 and marcsi.3 to add desc entries for experimenting and testing the artifact, and localize them
 # - Add threat level entry in EAW_MTA_scripted_localization
 # - Add effects for activation in EAW_MTA_effects, *and add an opposite deactivation effect if needed* (same file)
 # - Add an event for receiving the arty by adding the id of the artifact to the ROOT.MTA_owned_artifacts array, or add it to the country file if MTA starts with the arty
 
 # Yes, GetMTAArtifactName is defined twice in scripted loc file, one is for custom GUI and the other is for decision naming, they use different scopes for that reason
