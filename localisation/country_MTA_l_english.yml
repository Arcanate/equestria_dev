 ### EVENTS ###
 
 maretania.0.t:0 "The Ruins of Something Great."
 maretania.0.d:0 "The ruins were strewn around the different buildings, large pieces of debris littering the streets. Several pillars of smoke, black, from the burning of furniture and varying wooden flotsam and jetsam lying around as opposed to the previous heartbeat of steam and power. And yet, there was still life in the streets. Two horses, one a unicorn, one not walked through the streets, each wearing a white tunic, with a gold pin at the right shoulder.\n\n"You really think that this the end of the CSI? That the Storm King did so much damage, Dr. Mushriq?"\n\nThe unicorn trudged along, before stopping at a particularly large building, holes in it still visible, even if it had been repaired intermittedly with wood and nails. "Look at it. Two years, but still nothing. What is this meant to be, Dr. Altarus?"\n\nDr. Altarus looked at the building, before taking the few steps over to it and putting a hoof on the wall, feeling the masonry, "The start of something new. We may be bloodied, but we are unbowed. We still have the caves, right?"\n\n"We do. And the agents are still out there."\n\n"See, there is plenty of opportunity left." Dr. Altarus turned around and then looked up at the building again, bits of debris hanging on by a few threads. "We do still have to do something about this building though. And soon.""
 maretania.0.a:0 "Could we get some masons over here?"
 
 maretania.1.t:0 "Cracking Open the Cave"
 maretania.1.d:0 "Tools were spread all over the floor, machines, powered by steam and magic alike standing around the doors. Decorated with ornate inscriptions, and crystals, one could easily mistake such a door for belonging in the most holy of sanctums. And yet, it was a door out of the way, a long way from everything.\n\nPerfect for hiding the artifacts that the world has forgotten then.\n\nDr. Altarus looked over the whole spectacle, of zebras and horses milling about below, carefully noting the equipment not damaging the door.\n\n"A long time left?" Dr. Mushriq asked as he climbed the stairs to the platform, taking care to not trip over the tunic or the tall steps on the way up\n\nDr. Altarus looked back at Dr. Mushriq, briefly taking his look off the cave, "Not quite long. We are finally cracking the spells our colleagues put on the door when they sealed themselves in. Hopefully, everything is still there."\n\n"They sealed themselves in. And no one's been in there ever since. Least of all the looters." Dr. Mushriq answered, pointing to the door, still hermetically shut and locked.\n\n"I know, maybe it's just nerves. We still have a ways to go before we are back in business, even with Al Rabina getting everything under control finally." he said, before turning back to look down at the milieu below.\n\nDr. Mushriq joned the Dr. Altarus at the platform, leaning at the railing, "And what then? We have our artifacts, but the world is changing aorund us, and I don't think they are that poite to let us operate unrestricted and without their knowledge. At best it's a protest, at worst, the masquerade is broken, and our agents are shot."\n\n"We are many things, Dr. Mushriq, but we are not stuck in the past. We will find new ways around it. Even if we have to find completely new ways."\n\nAs those words fell, a mighty creak was heard from the doors, the crystals glowing a bright blue, before the doors slowly opened. Bit by bit, ever so slowly, the massive double doors moved aside to reveal the thing that so many had died and lied to protect. Rows upon rows of crates, boxes and bells. All containing an artifact of power. All a part of the CSI. All something to be contained and protected, lest the security of the world itself would come at risk."
 maretania.1.a:0 "Now for the real work."
 
 maretania.2.t:0 "The Committee for Analysis"
 maretania.2.d:0 "Many buildings had been left desolate once the Storm came. Many more were destroyed. And yet, life still goes on. Horses, mages and non-mages. CSI Agents and non-agents had begun to return to the cities, busy working on restoring the buildings. And in one, non-descript room in the middle of Mareib, a small circle of mages were gathered.\n\n"So what was it that you called us here for Dr. Miftah?" a unicorn asked, his tagelmust largely dusted up from the work going on outside.\n\n"It's very simple, Dr. Huquq", Dr. Miftah answered, putting a heavy tome on the table, kicking up dust "New ideas have spread, and they might be of interest."\n\nDr. Huquq looked over at the tome, reading on the title. 'The Governance of Severnaya'. She looked to Dr. Miftah, who merely nodded. "Socialism? That strange thing from Equus?"\n\nDr. Miftah opened the tome, browsing through the various "The same. The Committee has always been for analysis to keep the worst parts of the CSI in check. This is the answer. Don't forget all those outside the CSI we have to take care of."\n\nDr. Huquq sighed, noting down a few sentences on a piece of paper. "I'll look into it, but remember that for now, we are not going to make a move. For now, we maintain our job. Analyzing the reports that come in from around the Initiative and taking action whenever someone does something contrary to our goals. Secure, Contain and Protect." With those words, she rose, catching Dr. Miftah by surprise.\n\n"But doesn't this prove promising? A way to provide for everyone and make sure that we can continue to nudge the Initiative in the right direction?" he asked, just as she prepared to trot out the door.\n\nShe sighed and looked back. "I'll read the book, and think about it. Just don't go too loudly about it," she said, levitating over the book, hiding it under her clothing."
 maretania.2.a:0 "Maybe one day, it will come to pass"
 
 maretania.3.t:0 "The Outreach Office"
 maretania.3.d:0 "There were many things that the CSI and the Magocracy in general were good, indeed, very good at, but interacting with other nations were not really their forte. That fell to the Outreach Office. \n\nThe meeting rooms in the Site also tended to be spartan, the complete reversal of the rest of the world. The lack of the trappings in the room was clearly noted by the Committee as they entered the room. "What is all this for Director Alqatat? We have our hooves full as it is with trying to reestablish the barest lines of communication with our agents." one of the agents in the room exclaimed almost immediately after they were sitting at the table, a bottle of bitter on the table.\n\nThe Director repressed the instinct to fill up a glass and take something strong while explaining. "It's very simple Agent Duyujayn. We are between two powers who are taking advantage of the situation. And we must be ready to steer the Initiative in the direction beneficial to us." he said, while fiddling with a slide projector, a small stack of slides already sitting in a box beside it.\n\nThe agent nodded along, before levitating the bottle over and pouring himself a glass. "And what about the Analysis Committee? Or Command? Can't imagine they'll be pleased about us taking control."\n\n"Let me take care of them. The ruleset of the Initiative is more convoluted than the tunnels in the Caves. We can find a way to take control if the time comes." Director Alqatat mused, finally getting the projector to work, showing a map of the region around the Arabian Sea. "This is what we're looking at. And if we can get enough support from both, we can be in the driver's seat. Everyone. This is an unparalleled opportunity"\n\nAgent Duyujayn at the map, before taking stock of the situation, "You are sure that this won't backfire on us?"\n\nThe Director looked up at the map, and then to the Agent. "Of course not.""
 maretania.3.a:0 "Surely not."
 
 marcsi.1.t:0 "Action with [FROM.GetMTAArtifactNameDec]"
 marcsi.1.d:0 "[FROM.GetMTAArtifactNameDec] has been retrieved from its containment within the Cave and the leadership of the CSI gathers to decide on what they want to do with the chosen artifact. The ancient, mysterious items brought to custody in Maretania leave many itching for experimentation, perhaps even activation of the artifacts at their hooves - after all, to contain and protect the artifacts necessitates collecting information on exactly how they need to be contained. There is always a risk involved when dealing with such magical power, however.\n\nFor you, Director, there are several options to take.\n\nYou may order a disposable employee to try to activate the artifact. If the CSI has any instructions on how the artifact is used, they will be put to effect, otherwise, the employee will be ordered to carefully attempt one of several standard artifact activation procedures. With how unpredictable the effects may be, however, this is a risky approach.\n\nPerhaps, before resorting to that, you may order careful experimentation on the artifact first. Using state of the art technology and procedures such as strength tests or exposure to certain chemicals, we can predict what the artifact might do once activated, and so more easily guess whether it should be touched or sealed away forever.\n\nFinally, you may order the artifact to be secured, sealed away forever in one of the Cave's vaults, to ensure that it will never cause harm to anyone nor see the light of day."
 marcsi.1.a:0 "Experiment with the artifact."
 marcsi.1.b:0 "Try to activate the artifact."
 marcsi.1.c:0 "Secure the artifact and seal it away."
 
 marcsi.2.t:0 "Artifact Experimentation"
 marcsi.2.d1:0 "If you see this text, this means your attempt at logging the identity of the experimented artifact with arrays works. Now you can use this for artifact effects"
 marcsi.2.d2:0 "You fucked up"
 marcsi.2.a:0 "OK."
