 ### IDEAS ###
 MTA_CSI:0 "Containment and Security Initiative"
 MTA_CSI_desc:0 "Maretania is the home of the Containment and Security Initiative, a worldwide underground operation to investigate, capture and secure powerful magical artifacts to make sure that they remain in responsible hooves. Strike forces serving the CSI consist of powerful trained mages who can take on platoons by themselves. Even then, it has been weakened by the Storm King’s recent rampage."

 ### DECISIONS ###
 
 ### EVENTS ###
 
 maretania.0.t:0 "The Ruins of Something Great."
 maretania.0.d:0 "The ruins were strewn around the different buildings, large pieces of debris littering the streets. Several pillars of smoke, black, from the burning of furniture and varying wooden flotsam and jetsam lying around as opposed to the previous heartbeat of steam and power. And yet, there was still life in the streets. Two horses, one a unicorn, one not walked through the streets, each wearing a white tunic, with a gold pin at the right shoulder.\n\n"You really think that this the end of the CSI? That the Storm King did so much damage, Dr. Mushriq?"\n\nThe unicorn trudged along, before stopping at a particularly large building, holes in it still visible, even if it had been repaired intermittedly with wood and nails. "Look at it. Two years,  but still nothing. What is this meant to be, Dr. Altarus?"\n\nDr. Altarus looked at the building, before taking the few steps over to it and putting a hoof on the wall, feeling the masonry, "The start of something new. We may be bloodied, but we are unbowed. We still have the caves, right?"\n\n"We do. And the agents are still out there."\n\n"See, there is plenty of opportunity left." Dr. Altarus turned around and then looked up at the building again, bits of debris hanging on by a few threads. "We do still have to do something about this building though. And soon.""
 maretania.0.a:0 "Could we get some masons over here?"
 
 maretania.1.t:0 "Cracking Open the Cave."
 maretania.1.d:0 "Tools were spread all over the floor, machines, powered by steam and magic alike standing around the doors. Decorated with ornate inscriptions, and crystals, one could easily mistake such a door for belonging in the most holy of sanctums. And yet, it was a door out of the way, a long way from everything.\n\nPerfect for hiding the artifacts that the world has forgotten then.\n\nDr. Altarus looked over the whole spectacle, of zebras and horses milling about below, carefully noting the equipment not damaging the door.\n\n"A long time left?" Dr. Mushriq asked as he climbed the stairs to the platform, taking care to not trip over the tunic or the tall steps on the way up\n\nDr. Altarus looked back at Dr. Mushriq, briefly taking his look off the cave, "Not quite long. We are finally cracking the spells our colleagues put on the door when they sealed themselves in. Hopefully, everything is still there."\n\n"They sealed themselves in. And no one's been in there ever since. Least of all the looters." Dr. Mushriq answered, pointing to the door, still hermetically shut and locked.\n\n"I know, maybe it's just nerves. We still have a ways to go before we are back in business, even with Al Rabina getting everything under control finally." he said, before turning back to look down at the milieu below.\n\nDr. Mushriq joned the Dr. Altarus at the platform, leaning at the railing, "And what then? We have our artifacts, but the world is changing aorund us, and I don't think they are that poite to let us operate unrestricted and without their knowledge. At best it's a protest, at worst, the masquerade is broken, and our agents are shot."\n\n"We are many things, Dr. Mushriq, but we are not stuck in the past. We will find new ways around it. Even if we have to find completely new ways."\n\nAs those words fell, a mighty creak was heard from the doors, the crystals glowing a bright blue, before the doors slowly opened. Bit by bit, ever so slowly, the massive double doors moved aside to reveal the thing that so many had died and lied to protect. Rows upon rows of crates, boxes and bells. All containing an artifact of power. All a part of the CSI. All something to be contained and protected, lest the security of the world itself would come at risk."
 maretania.1.a:0 "Now for the real work."

 GetMTAArtifactDesc_1_tt:0 "CSI-666 is a testing kit of the model "Kleine Kemiker" retrieved during the Republican Revolution of 979 from the home of [REDACTED], after agents by chance in the city heard reports of a chemistry set that "Made petrol from nothing", CSI-666 was, after testing found to produce petrol when heating coal dust mixed with water in one of the flasks in the set. After extensive testing, concluding that no ill effects stem from the set, the decision has been taken to use CSI-666 for industrial purposes in Maretania."
 
 GetMTAArtifactName_2_tt:0 "Artifacts the World Forgot"
 GetMTAArtifactDesc_2_tt:0 "Forever locked doors, shut vaults, and chained boxes, holding an innumerable amount of relics and artifacts which have since been lost to memory. Do the CSI agents following instructions to keep these artifacts hidden know what they can do? Almost certainly not. But orders are orders, and so they will never see the light of day."
