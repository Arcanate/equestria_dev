### National Focuses ####
KIR_NATIONAL_FOCUS_TITLE_1:0 "Ending the Silence"
KIR_NATIONAL_FOCUS_TITLE_2:0 "Kiria in Bloom"
KIR_focus_1:0 "In the Vermilion Realm"
KIR_focus_1_desc:0 "With the ratification of the Hyacinth Accord and the departure of the Equestrian delegation, it is time for the Matriarch Superior to bring The Silence to the end in earnest and allow her realm to focus on modernization and rejoining the global community. A grand assembly of the brightest minds both within and without Kiria will serve as the basis upon which to begin our modernization efforts."
KIR_focus_2a:0 "Welcome the Delegates"
KIR_focus_2a_desc:0 "Delegates from across the Realm are arriving in Vermilion on a daily basis, bringing with them their own experiences and ideas on how to propel Kiria into the modern era in just a few short years. Many more come from beyond its borders, educated in foreign nations and exposed to their culture. All of their ideas will be useful in rewriting Kiria's future and starting a new chapter for the nation."
KIR_focus_2b:0 "Dispatch the Envoys"
KIR_focus_2b_desc:0 "While those living in Vermilion learned almost immediately that the imperial decrees that created The Silence have been repealed, there are countless thousands of kirin living in rural villages who are still unaware that their fortunes are soon to change for the better. Imperial heralds shall venture forth throughout the Realm and find every last village to share the Matriarch's good news."
KIR_focus_3a:0 "An Industrial Convocation"
KIR_focus_3a_desc:0 "If the Realm is to leap frog over a hundred years of missed progress and modernization, then it will need kirin educated and trained abroad to make it happen. Fickle Current will use his literati ties to the kirin diaspora to bring many of the kirin species' best and brightest minds home to help modernize the nation."
KIR_focus_3b:0 "The 3½ Year Plan"
KIR_focus_3b_desc:0 "The rapid modernization of Kiria will be a chaotic process that can only be sustained for so long. The Matriarch has proclaimed 'The Great Leap Forward', aiming to fast-track a century's worth of lost progress in three and a half years. The Plenum will have to deftly manage the tumultuous transformation of Kirin society and culture, if Kiria is to emerge intact from this rough and hasty metamorphosis."
KIR_focus_3d:0 "The Reform Bureau"
KIR_focus_3d_desc:0 "The Reform Bureau is a centralized executive body created for the All-Kiria Plenum for National Revival and granted a limited amount of imperial mandate by the Matriarch herself. It serves as the central governing body of the rapidly changing Realm, and it is here that the final drafts of bills are hammered out before being presented to the Matriarch Superior."
KIR_focus_3e:0 "Reestablish Rulership"
KIR_focus_3e_desc:0 "Over the course of The Silence's century-long stranglehold on the Realm of Kiria, the absolute authority of the Dynasty waned throughout the countryside as contact with Vermilion ceased to exist. A fresh round of imperial decrees and a reassertation of Matriarch Rain Shine's divine authority will begin to reassert her authority over the Realm, though some might chafe under our resumed governance."
KIR_focus_4a:0 "Call Upon the Diaspora"
KIR_focus_4a_desc:0 "From the very beginning of The Silence, some of our most talented and educated kirin fled the Realm to look for a better life elsewhere in the world. For a century, those kirin and their descendents have flourished abroad, gaining skills, knowledge, and capital that they could not gain here at home. We must bring them back to Kiria and ask them to help contribute to the modernization of our nation."
KIR_focus_4e:0 "In the Vermilion Court"
KIR_focus_4e_desc:0 "The delegates at the Plenum have begun to coalesce into different factions with their own ideas for how the modernization of Kiria should look, far from the heterogenous mixture of ideas and experiences that our Matriarch originally hoped for. But even still, the three parties that have formed at the Plenum do not represent the voices of all of her subjects..."
KIR_focus_4f:0 "The Office of Transmission"
KIR_focus_4f_desc:0 "Understanding the impossibility of having every kirin in the Realm venture to Vermilion to share their ideas and complaints with the Matriarch Superior, Matriarch Rain Shine has decreed that the Office of Transmission be established to receive letters and appeals from her subjects and bring them to her immediate attention, so that they may be discussed during gatherings of the Plenum."
KIR_focus_6b:0 "Resettle Kirin Returnees"
KIR_focus_6b_desc:0 "As the diaspora returns home, these long lost sons and daughters of Kiria need a place to live. Thankfully, Kiria is a vast realm full of land, and most of its towns and cities are underpopulated, meaning it will be easy to find homes for them all. This has the added benefit of boosting the average literacy rates in our population centers, even if it comes with a wide variety of potentially subversive foreign ideas."
KIR_focus_6c:0 "The Council of the Verdigris Rotunda"
KIR_focus_6c_desc:0 "The Morning Secretariat has long served as the Matriarch Superior's counciling body, offering advice and interpretations of Concord's will to the Matriarch to inform her rule. Since its conception, it has been entirely populated by priests and mystics from The Way of Fire, whose concerns are often more spirtual than temporal. A new Morning Secretariat must be appointed to guide Kiria in a new era."
KIR_focus_7b:0 "The All-Kiria Collegium"
KIR_focus_7b_desc:0 "Kiria's first modern university, the All-Kiria Collegium will train the next generation of native kirin intellectuals, with the assistance of professors and scholars educated in foreign lands such as Equestria and Yale. However, with new ideas come new dangerous thoughts. Will we let our professors teach freely, or should they be monitored by the Reform Bureau to weed out radical thought?"
KIR_focus_8a:0 "Industrialise the Breadbasket"
KIR_focus_8a_desc:0 "The farmland between the branches of the Great Mellifluve River is the most fertile in the land. With the benefits of modern farming techniques and tools, it alone could produce enough food to feed every kirin in the nation three square meals a day. Investment in the breadbasket will strengthen the nation as a whole for years to come, and ensure that no kirin goes hungry ever again."
KIR_focus_4c:0 "The Road to Vermilion"
KIR_focus_4c_desc:0 "The roads that once connected Vermilion with the rest of Concord's realm have long since been overgrown, owing to their disuse during The Silence. Using priests to recruit local laborers to the cause, clearing and reestablishing these roads will be crucial to once more unifying the realm under Matriarch Superior Rain Shine's rule."
KIR_focus_5b:0 "Scholar-Monk Travelling Syndicates"
KIR_focus_5b_desc:0 "Monks and priests have long been the preeminent backbone of Kiria's education system, traveling across the land to spread their teachings of The Way of Fire with the common kirin, and training those who enter their order to read and write. By recruiting these traveling syndicates to educate the populace, we can make bold steps in combating illiteracy throughout the Realm."
KIR_focus_5d:0 "The Laws of the Realm"
KIR_focus_5d_desc:0 "While we have moved to enact new laws and decrees to improve the standing of the realm, there are still many harsh laws that exist from The Silence. One such law makes the transformation into the nirik state a capital offense punishable by death. Though loosely enforced throughout The Silence, a debate rages on the necessity of this law as the realm modernizes at a rate never seen before."
KIR_focus_7a:0 "The Role of the Way of Fire vis-à-vis the State"
KIR_focus_7a_desc:0 "Since the creation of the Vermilion Realm, the nation has been ruled as a theocracy, with The Way of Fire and Concord's teachings inextricably entwined with every facet of governance and daily life. But now a proposal is crossing the Plenum floor to extricate the inextricable. Is it possible to partially secularize this centuries-old theocracy, or is the mere suggestion of that possibility nothing but heresy?"
KIR_focus_7f:0 "The Role of the Matriarch Superior"
KIR_focus_7f_desc:0 "The position of the Matriarch Superior is one of unlimited divine authority bestowed on the Matriarch by Concord herself. Her powers are broad and poorly defined, and any decree she issues is to be considered law as soon as it is proclaimed. Such archaic methods of governance have no place in a modern nation, and so it is time to codify the powers of the Matriarch Superior and her government."
KIR_focus_8e:0 "Restoring the Bureaucracy"
KIR_focus_8e_desc:0 "Following the imposition of The Silence, the system of bureacrats and administrators that allowed the nation to function as a cohesive whole has since collapsed. It is time to appoint new advisors, governors, and administrators to once more take control of the Realm, bringing the various local administrations back under the Matriarch's control and restarting the economy."
KIR_focus_4d:0 "Technological Imports"
KIR_focus_4d_desc:0 "If we are to advance as a nation, we cannot afford to waste time rediscovering technologies that have long since been perfected in foreign lands. By asking the returning kirin literati for help in supplying the nation with copies and examples of state of the art technology, we can reverse-engineer our own designs and rapidly scale up our industrial capabilities in a very short timeframe."
KIR_focus_5h:0 "Land Repossessions"
KIR_focus_5h_desc:0 "Much of the Realm's land falls into one of two categories: unpopulated bastions of nature, or sprawling subsistence farms. By concentrating our efforts on reorganizing our farmland and making in-roads into untapped nature reserves, we can greatly expand the amount of available land we have for building projects, allowing us to increase the density of our growing industrial base."
KIR_focus_5a:0 "Geological Surveys"
KIR_focus_5a_desc:0 "Kiria is full of untapped potential when it comes to our resources. What we produce today only scratches the surface of the Realm's potential. We know that our hills are full of natural resources that have yet to be properly exploited by industrial excavation operations. All we have to do is fund geological surveys to find the best deposits and encourage excavation companies to dig them up."
KIR_focus_5c:0 "The "Three Strengths" Campaign"
KIR_focus_5c_desc:0 "The modernization efforts of the Plenum have long been championed by the 'Three Strengths' campaign, which promotes Harmony, Heritage, and Homeland as its three most important values. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that each strength has been taken up by a different clique as their championing point. One of these cliques will naturally resonate more with the kirin people than the others."
KIR_focus_6h:0 "Northern Industry"
KIR_focus_6h_desc:0 "Fragrance and Rhapsody were two important bastions of modernization before The Silence, and both cities resisted its imposition to various extents, planting the seeds for future modernization efforts. Now, they will be some of the first cities to benefit from the resurgence of modernization, and are already constructing massive industrial complexes to capitalize on this change."
KIR_focus_6a:0 "Agrarian Consolidation"
KIR_focus_6a_desc:0 "As kirin moved out of the cities at the beginning of The Silence, they set up subsistence farms across the countryside wherever they could find land. Most of these farms are small and poorly managed, reliant wholly on manual labor to grow any crops. Consolidating clusters of these farms under one manager and bringing in modern farming equipment will increase their productivity and free up valuable land."
KIR_focus_7c:0 "The Riverine Economy"
KIR_focus_7c_desc:0 "The Great Mellifluve is the lifeblood of central Kiria, its vast waterways connecting distant towns and cities while providing fertile ground for farmland in between. Investing in the local economy that has grown around the river will make a strength of our nation that much stronger, allowing us to create a booming business growth in our heartlands that fuels growth throughout the Realm."
KIR_focus_8b:0 "Open Up the Ports"
KIR_focus_8b_desc:0 "The port of Fragrance was once the most important port in all of Kiria, connecting our nation with traders from as far away as Griffonia. Fragrance's port was shut down when The Silence began, and its harbors have fallen into decay. With enough investment, however, we can return Fragrance to its former glory, and Fragrance can once again connect us to the rest of the world."
KIR_focus_9b:0 "Riches of the Mellifluve"
KIR_focus_9b_desc:0 "The far branches of the Mellifluve once carried their exports all the way down is waters to the city of Verdant, where they were organized and recorded before being launched to the rest of the Realm as valuable products or to the world as trade goods. The towns along these branches have long since withered with the collapse of the economy, and need our help to become prosperous once more."
KIR_focus_10a:0 "Urban-Led Modernisation"
KIR_focus_10a_desc:0 "Modernisation, as has been seen time and time again, starts in the cities and trickles down to the countryside. Though our urban centers declined during The Silence, we can rebuild them with new infrastructure that can support the modernisation of the realm. This will have the side effect of allowing us to draw more kirin into our cities, bringing them to whole new levels of productivity."
KIR_focus_8g:0 "Verdant Manufactories"
KIR_focus_8g_desc:0 "The city of Verdant is proving to be a fertile ground for the growth of modernisation in the realm. With an abundance of labor and room to expand, the working class in Verdant is growing faster than perhaps anywhere else in Kiria. But with all this new labor comes the spread of new and radical ideas, and the workers that build factories today may get ideas about taking them back tomorrow..."
KIR_focus_9a:0 "The Trans-Kiria Railway"
KIR_focus_9a_desc:0 "If Kiria is to become united and modern, then a way of bringing people and goods from one side of the nation to the other is absolutely essential. While the Great Mellifluve has long served as a crucial highway for our realm, it cannot reach everywhere. The construction of modern and standardized railways throughout the realm will bring our people together like never before."
KIR_focus_9c:0 "Kiria on the World Stage"
KIR_focus_9c_desc:0 "We have come far in our reforms, and the world is beginning to take notice. It is time that we invite delegations from all across the world to Vermilion to witness not only our traditional culture, but the advances we have made. This isn't all fun and games however; Kiria needs help to move into the modern era, and making a good impression on our foreign peers will make them more likely to lend us aid."
KIR_focus_11a:0 "Breakneck Industrialisation"
KIR_focus_11a_desc:0 "Rapid industrialization of our Realm, at a rate never seen anywhere else in the world, has come with its own host of challenges. One of the most critical of these is the need for skilled and unskilled labor, and we have gone to great lengths to attain workers for our modern society. But bringing so many kirin to one place to work for the gears of capitalism comes the risk of radical leftist ideas spreading around..."
KIR_focus_4b:0 "The Autumnal Premiership"
KIR_focus_4b_desc:0 "Premier Autumn Blaze is a young kirin left in charge of the greatest undertaking in kirin history, with consequences that will shape our history for decades to come. It is a lot of responsibility for one mare to shoulder, but she is determined to shoulder it, and Matriarch Superior Rain Shine has entrusted in her almost unlimited authority to choose the path of the nation's modernisation."
KIR_focus_5e:0 "The Charter of Rights"
KIR_focus_5e_desc:0 "As we move away from the society of our past to the society of a modern age, we have the opportunity to learn from the struggles of other nations. Industrialization was often brutal on the laborers that fueled it, and protections for these workers only came after they were forced to endure unimaginable suffering. Let us guarantee protections for our workers so they do not have to needlessly suffer as well."
KIR_focus_6d:0 "Repeal the Quiescence"
KIR_focus_6d_desc:0 "The Quiescence was a series of decrees that went along with The Silence that banned the study of science, religion, philosophy, and many other forms of education in the realm. As a result, our society has stagnated, and much of the populace is illiterate. If we wish to educate a new generation of kirin, the Quiescence must be repealed in its entirety."
KIR_focus_8f:0 "An Imperial Constitution"
KIR_focus_8f_desc:0 "It is time to draft a constitution that will lay out the powers and privileges of each branch of our new government. The authority of the Matriarch Superior will be defined, and the responsibilities of the Morning Secretariat clearly laid out. However, the Realm lacks a modern judicial system, and it is up to the Premier to come up with a proposal for one that will best serve the interests of the Realm."
KIR_focus_3c:0 "Reassemble the Banners"
KIR_focus_3c_desc:0 "Kiria once possessed an impressive military supported by the banner system, where each city contributed soldiers to a local banner that could be rallied and commanded at the Matriarch's discretion. These soldiers would then be given land following their service, creating an entire class of proud soldier-citizens. It is time to rally these soldiers once more to face the threats of the modern era."
KIR_focus_4g:0 "Recommission the Rhapsody Arsenal"
KIR_focus_4g_desc:0 "The Rhapsody Arsenal was once the forefront of kirin weapons invention, and gained fame across eastern Zebrica for the quality of the cannons they manufactured. But for a century now, the arsenal has been closed and abandoned. It is time to reopen the Rhapsody Arsenal and combine the inventions of the modern era with the ingenuity of the kirin that once made it so renowned."
KIR_focus_5g:0 "Recall, Rearm, Regroup"
KIR_focus_5g_desc:0 "Reassembling the banners was a start, but there are currently too few kirin who have answered the call to form a functional modern military. We must start by organizing a limited conscription and drafting peasants and commoners to create regional militias that, with proper training, may one day join the banners and provide the backbone for our modern army."
KIR_focus_5f:0 "The New Standard Army"
KIR_focus_5f_desc:0 "It is difficult to create a modern army from scratch, but we will have to try regardless. Standardizing army doctrine and training regimens, laying out the benefits and terms of service, and acquiring foreign weapons and surplus equipment will go a long way in providing the basis to build our new standard army upon."
KIR_focus_6e:0 "Found the Motor Bureau"
KIR_focus_6e_desc:0 "The days of marching an army from one end ofthe nation to the other is over. A truly modern army is able to move its troops to where they need to go using motorized equipment. Fickle Current has offered to use his funds to procure Griffonian trucks and establish a motor bureau that will aid in researching and producing trucks to allow our army to motorize."
KIR_focus_7d:0 "Doctrinal Modernisation"
KIR_focus_7d_desc:0 "Modern wars are not fought with infantry formations, pitched battles, and sheer force of will. Modern wars are won by well-planned and coordinated actions defined by a military's doctrine that dictates how the army should act. Developing our own land doctrines will be useful for modernising our army and giving it the ability to fight effectively in the field."
KIR_focus_6f:0 "Kirin Rifle Designs"
KIR_focus_6f_desc:0 "Our species is blessed by Concord in that every individual can use basic telekinesis to manipulate objects and hold weapons. We can use this gift that we have been blessed with to create weapons ideal for our species that only we can use, rather than relying on the designs of other nations. If we want to create a functional modern army, then we need guns made here at home, and we need a lot of them."
KIR_focus_8c:0 "The Massicot War School"
KIR_focus_8c_desc:0 "The training grounds of Massicot once were the pride of our army, where thousands of soldiers could be trained in the art of war. The War School has been closed for a century now, and no new students have passed through its doors. To rebuild our army, we must reopen the school and begin training the next generation of soldiers."
KIR_focus_7e:0 "Vanguards of a New Age"
KIR_focus_7e_desc:0 "The kirin vanguards have long been the best of our best soldiers. Lightly armed and armored, they fought as deadly skirmishers at the front of our armies, whittling the enemy down and threatening their flanks while the main host moved in to engage. But in the age of gunpowder and mechanized warfare, we need to adapt our vanguards to incorporate modern hit and run tactics into their arsenal."
KIR_focus_8d:0 "Seafarer Marines"
KIR_focus_8d_desc:0 "The Sycee Trading House has long employed seafarer marines in Griffonia to protect its ships from pirate attack when moving valuable goods along the high seas. These marines are largely members of the diaspora, and would be better served protecting their homeland rather than business interests. We will negotiate the assimilation of Sycee's seafarer marines into our banners to bolster our army's capabilities."
KIR_focus_9e:0 "Through Flame and Fury"
KIR_focus_9e_desc:0 "The Vermilion Banners were once the most feared and professional fighting force in eastern Zebrica, but The Silence has allowed it to decay into a shell of its former self. If we are to complete the rebuilding of our magnificent army, then we must encourage the bravery of our soldiers in the field and the innovation of our philosophers behind it."
KIR_focus_9d:0 "The Experimental Armored Corps"
KIR_focus_9d_desc:0 "The modern battlefield heavily features the use of bulletproof armored vehicles, which can create an unstoppable spearhead at the front of an offensive, or deliver a decisive counterattack to an enemy breakthrough. While we currently lack the industry to create state-of-the-art tanks, we can invest in light armored vehicles as a stopgap until our industrial capabilities expand further."
KIR_focus_4h:0 "A Vermilion Armada"
KIR_focus_4h_desc:0 "Our once proud navy was mothballed, and later scuttled, as a result of The Silence. We control a large swath of coastline in eastern Zebrica, yet we have no navy to patrol it. It is critical that we begin to build and assemble a modern navy to keep our coastlines safe and allow us to project our force over the waves that we rightfully rule."
KIR_focus_6g:0 "Develop the Eastern Seaboard"
KIR_focus_6g_desc:0 "The kirin living on our seaboards were almost entirely reliant on fishing to survive throughout The Silence; as a result, the eastern seaboard in particular is woefully underdeveloped. We can make use of these scattered fishing villages to cobble together local workforces for new dockyards and shipyards along the coast that will boost our naval production and economy."
KIR_focus_7g:0 "The Fragrant Flotilla"
KIR_focus_7g_desc:0 "Sitting at the bottom of the Fragrant harbor are three old warships, once the most modern ships in the Realm, but scuttled during a sailor mutiny in the city during The Silence. They have been underwater for decades now, but expeditions have confirmed that they are still in decent condition. Raising these three ships and retrofitting them will allow us to field three outdated but formidable ships in our new navy."
KIR_focus_9f:0 "Purchase Equestrian Naval Blueprints"
KIR_focus_9f_desc:0 "We do not have time to develop modern naval ships from scratch, but we do have friends who are already at the forefront of naval thought. We will benefit from our close ties to Equestria to acquire modern blueprints for ships, weapons, fire control systems, and more that will allow us to begin to construct a modern navy."
KIR_focus_10b:0 "Reclaim Auburn Isle"
KIR_focus_10b_desc:0 "The pirates of Nacre on Auburn Isle have long been a nuisance to the Realm. Their constant raids along our coastline have destablized us for too long, and their punishment is overdue. We will sail forth with our new navy and our modern army and put an end to the pirate menace in Nacre!"

### Events ###
kirin.1.t:0 "Daybreak Over Vermilion"
kirin.1.d:0 "Matriarch Superior Rain Shine set her brush aside and watched as the last of the black ink dried on the flattened scroll of parchment before her. It had taken her weeks to get to this point, but now, for the first time in her 46 years of rule, she had signed an Imperial decree that would be read all throughout the Realm of Kiria. With that final brushstroke, and with the copies that the scribes would make in the morning and distribute to the far reaches of the country, The Silence, her mother's legacy, would come to an end after over a century of stagnation and decay.\n\nIt did not make her happy. If anything, Rain Shine felt nervous, wondering if what she was doing was the right thing for her subjects — subjects she had never met before. But her thoughts were stolen away from that when a servant entered and announced that Autumn Blaze was waiting to see her, and the mare in question entered a few moments later at Rain Shine's behest. Autumn bowed before her Matriarch, though Rain Shine keenly noted the awe and reverence the lesser kirin offered her at witnessing her regal body, and stood up. "You wished to see me, Matriarch?" Autumn asked.\n\n"I did," Rain Shine said, and her magic lifted a separate scroll off of her desk, neatly wrapped in a vermilion ribbon, and passed it to Autumn Blaze, who took it in her own telekinetic grip. "With The Silence ending, I am bringing together kirin from all across the Realm to discuss how we can rebuild our nation and bring it into the modern age. I am calling the first All-Kirin Plenum for National Revival... and as the mare who was so instrumental in helping the Equestrian delegation reach Vermilion, I want you to be its Premier."\n\nAutumn Blaze looked shocked at the sudden responsibility, but she nevertheless nodded and bowed again. "I... I'm not sure if I'm ready for that responsibility, Matriarch, but if you think so..."\n\nRain Shine cut her off with a wave of her hoof and an assuring smile."
kirin.1.a:0 ""You will do well, Autumn. I know this much.""

kirin.2.t:0 "A Letter from Autumn Blaze"
kirin.2.d:0 "Dear Applejack and Fluttershy,\n\nOh, I hope this letter reaches you two; it's not like Kiria hasn't had a functional postal system in a century, right? The hoops I had to go through just to send a piece of paper halfway across the world... \n\nI got a new job! Matriarch Superior Rain Shine (you remember her, right? The really tall kirin?) decided to call kirin from all across the realm to Vermilion to participate in the All-Kirin Plenum for National Revival, and she made ME its premier! Talk about a leap in responsibility, right? I've never led anything before, but I guess the Matriarch saw something in me when I helped you two make the last leg of the journey from Massicot to Vermilion. It's a lot to take on, and I'm not sure I'm the best kirin for the job, but I'll give it my best regardless!\n\nBut you should see Vermilion now! When you left, it was like a sleepy teenager asking for five more minutes of sleep, but now the city is absolutely bustling. I've never seen anything like it before! There are so many kirin from all over the realm pouring in every day to attend the Plenum, and there's this wonderful, colorful feeling of hope and excitement just buzzing through the air. I've spent a LOT of time meeting all the delegates I'll be working with during the Plenum, and two in particular really stuck out. The first is Winter Frost, one of our Way of Fire priestesses from Rhapsody, who's a bit of a stickler for tradition and knows way more about our fire goddess, Concord, than I could ever hope to learn. She's brought a whole bunch of priests and mystics in from across the realm to participate in the Plenum, and though I didn't do too well at my religious studies when I briefly considered considered becoming a mystic back in the day, I'm sure we'll have lots to talk about. The other kirin is a fellow called Fickle Current who's been living in Griffonia all his life. I didn't even know what Griffonia was until last month! But he's the grandson of some businesskirin who fled the realm when The Silence started, and he brought a lot of the kirin diaspora back with him to start fixing up the homeland. They even arrived at the capital in automobiles imported from Griffonia, which pretty much nokirin in the capital had ever seen before. To say he made a grand entrance would be an understatement, though I think that rubbed Winter Frost and her mystics the wrong way; the two of them don't seem like they got off on the right hoof, so to say. But I'm confident with time we'll be able to smooth those issues out at the Plenum. After all, we're all working together to better our nation, right?\n\nI hope you're doing well! Wish us the best of luck for the Plenum, because we're gonna need it!"
kirin.2.a:0 "Your friend, Premier Autumn Blaze"

kirin.3.t:0 "A Letter from the Premier"
kirin.3.d:0 "Most Divine Matriarch Superior,\n\nToday marks a week since you decreed that the imperial heralds would fan out across the realm and deliver the news of the All-Kirin Plenum for National Revival to the kirin of your domain. I'm pleased to report that the decree is proceeding swimmingly, apart from a few hiccups here and there, and your subjects are finally learning that The Silence is over. I've already been receiving reports from the envoys in the field that many towns and settlements are taking to the streets with joy and excitement, and I understand their feelings perfectly. You, Matriarch, are blessed with a lifespan that lasts twice as long as the rest of us, thanks to Concord's divine favor, so time must seem to feel twice as fast. Sixty years is hardly half your strengthened lifespan, but an entire generation of kirin has been born, raised, grown old, and is now passing on in that same time, having only known The Silence their entire lives. In a century from now, The Silence will have only been a fraction of your life, while it has come to dominate the lives of all of your subjects; ending it now and starting a new chapter for the kirin species fills all of us with joy and excitement at what tomorrow brings. The hardships we all were born into and lived through will soon feel like a distant memory now that we all, together, get to shape our destiny, and for that, you have won the undying love and devotion of all your subjects. I don't think I can possibly overstate just how great of a change this will be for all of us.\n\nEven still, I know this won't be easy, nor will the future we create for Kiria be what everykirin desires. Some kirin want to rapidly modernize us to catch up to the rest of the world, while others are far more cautious, remembering the disasters of modernization under your mother's rule. There will probably be bickering and arguing and fighting, but good things don't come to those who wait. They have to be fought for, and that's what we'll all be doing at the Plenum. With your guidance, I know we can create a bright new future for all kirin, and I'm thrilled to serve by your side.\n\nLet's do this together, and let's do it right."
kirin.3.a:0 "Your devoted servant, Premier Autumn Blaze"

kirin.4.t:0 "The Great Leap Forward"
kirin.4.d:0 "Matriarch Superior Rain Shine momentarily hesitated as she took to the podium placed on the steps before the imperial palace. Her red eyes shifted downwards and scanned over the hundreds... no, thousands of faces staring up at her. She had to remind herself that this was the first time most of her subjects had ever seen her in person. Rarely had she ventured outside of the palace walls all her life, and even rarer still had been any occasions to speak to her subjects, or let them speak to her. Her ascension through her mother's funeral pyre had been a quiet and closed affair within the palace walls, and only imperial proclamations to the kirin of Vermilion would have let any know that a change in leadership had taken place 36 years ago. Now, she stood before them as their new Matriarch Superior, ready to lead them out of the darkness of The Silence that had stifled kirin society for so long.\n\n"My faithful and loyal subjects," Rain Shine began, glancing down at the prepared speech in front of her and then back at the crowd. "I know this is the first time most of you have ever seen your Matriarch. I know this is the first time you have ever heard my voice. But a new era for Kiria could not begin without allowing you to meet me. I am not my mother. I am not the mare who created the decrees and laws that created what we call today The Silence. I am not Noctilucent Charm, but I am her daughter. And today, I will begin the atonement for my mother's mistakes."\n\nSurprised murmuring passed through the crowd, and Rain Shine let that proclamation sink in before continuing. "I have set in motion a series of decrees and appointments that will bring about the end of The Silence," she said. "Today is the beginning of a new era for Kiria. But I alone cannot forge our future. It is time for all the kirin of the Realm to join me in this future we create together. The kirin people must join me on a great leap forwards, a leap that will see us modernize our industry, our technology, our agriculture, and our science. This realm that has been entrusted to us by Concord is blessed by her wisdom and favor. We kirin are an ingenious people, a people who are intimately familiar with the creative and destructive force of fire. We will use our gifts to make the most of Concord's blessing. Through hard work, grit, and fervent devotion to the fire goddess, the Realm of Kiria WILL emerge from The Silence to become a world power within a decade. There is nothing that we cannot accomplish together!\n\n"So I ask of you, kirin of the Realm... will you join me in The Great Leap Forward?"\n\nThunderous applause and ecstatic cheering was the crowd's response, seemingly audible across the entirety of the Realm."

kirin.5.t:0 "Émigrés Return Home"
kirin.5.d:0 "Fickle Current watched from Fragrance's harbor as another ship pulled into port. The ships, varying in sizes from small mail ships to larger passenger ships, had been arriving in Kiria's northernmost port city by the day, each one loaded with dozens of kirin making the return to their ancestral homelands. These were the kirin of the diaspora, descendents of kirin who had the good sense to flee the Realm when The Silence began. Many had longed for home their whole lives, to reconnect with their people and their families, but unwilling to sacrifice their livelihoods to scratch out an impoverished living in squalor that such a move would force upon them. But now, with The Silence ending and Matriarch Superior Rain Shine inviting all kirin living abroad to return home and help modernize the nation, the diaspora had found the excuse it had been looking for to finally cease living abroad like exiles and return home as heroes.\n\nThe ship in front of Current had sailed in from Griffonia, judging by the flags hanging from its smokestacks, and the businesskirin pushed against the crowd surging off of the ship to find one particular face. He found it on the body of a green kirin with a white mane, and as soon as the two recognized each other, they stepped forward and embraced on the docks. "Current!" the green stallion exclaimed. "So good to see you! I feel like it's been years!"\n\n"Only a few, Cypress Snow, but years it has been." The two kirin stepped back, and then Cypress followed Current as the two began to move toward an automobile parked on the cobblestone roads by the docks. "I'm glad you came," Current continued as they walked. "Though I imagine giving up a position at Greenback University had to have been rough."\n\n"Not as rough as trying to educate you when you were my student," Cypress joked. "But I imagine that my talents will be better suited here than in Yale. The kirin here are in desperate need of somebody to educate them. We have to bring the Realm's standards up to snuff with the rest of the world, or we will be left behind."\n\nThe two sat down in the back of the automobile, and the driver slowly pulled away from the harbor. "The return of the diaspora is something the Realm desperately needs," Current agreed. "The kirin living here are all poor peasants living in the mud of their farms. The Realm needs us if it's ever going to make itself great again, even if half of these farmers see us as foreigners trying to end their way of life."\n\n"They should be happy about it," Cypress said with a derisive snort. "After all, we'll be doing all the work, and they'll be seeing all the reward. Or, well, most of it." He smiled at his former student. "I imagine the Matriarch will amply reward us for saving her nation when all is said and done.""

kirin.6.t:0 "The All-Kiria Collegium"
kirin.6.d:0 "Autumn Blaze let out a sigh of relief and stretched her sore legs as the last of the bills to lay the foundation of the All-Kiria Collegium, Kiria's first modern university and heavily inspired by academics from Yale, finally passed the floor by a razor thin margin. The contentious issue that had turned what should have been a good idea everykirin could agree on into a parliamentary nightmare had been the university's stance on religion: the university was officially secular, and would not make mandatory the attendance of sermons and the observance of holy days that were crucial to The Way of Fire. Winter Frost's religious clique had fought tooth and nail to reject the proposed university's secularism, claiming that it would corrupt kirin intellectuals for generations to come and only breed heresy and disrespect for Concord, while Fickle Current and his proposed dean of the new school, Cypress Snow, had claimed that removing religion from the lecture hall would allow new ideas to grow without the shackles of tradition and mysticism to hold them down. The debate had been furious and lasted for hours, and in the end, it fell on Rain Shine and her supporters to decide the matter in Current's favor. The university would be secular, and Cypress Snow would be its dean.\n\nBut that had not been the end of it. As soon as the floor cleared from the vote, Winter Frost stood up in her booth and put her hooves on the vermilion rail separating the seats from the plenum center. "If we are going to plant the seeds of heresy in our garden, we must at least have somekirin to watch over it and pluck the weeds as necessary," she began. "I motion that the Collegium be placed under the jurisdiction of the Reform Bureau. This kind of right-wing radicalism that Current and his cronies bathe in must not be allowed to breed at our academic centers, or we will have turned our backs on Concord and the Matriarch Superior!"\n\nFickle Current was quick to respond, hopping to his hooves after only having taken his seat moments before. "You lost the fight over the university, and now you wish to cripple what you cannot control!" he spat back at her. "The traditionalists control the Reform Bureau; you would stifle our academics instead of letting them grow and blossom." Before Frost could respond, he turned to Autumn Blaze and addressed her directly. "Premier, your faction decided the last vote, so put an end to this one as well. Do not let Winter Frost and her traditionalists censor this university, or the future of the kirin literati will suffer for it.""

kirin.7.d:0 ""There is another issue I want to talk to you about."\n\nAutumn Blaze looked up from her tea at Fickle Current, a small frown curving her lips as she met Fickle Current's eyes. The businesskirin always wore a suit, and today was no different, even in the heat outdoors. It made him look intelligent and sharp, but also marked him as an outsider, somekirin who hadn't lived in the Realm during The Silence, instead thriving in Griffonia until the time was right to return to the home of his grandparents. Every time he said something, Autumn had to remind herself that the two of them might as well be different species; the only thing they had in common was their race, and their hopes for bringing the Realm out of the dark century of The Silence—though even in that, they differed.\n\n"These 'Rising Fire' heretics... they're growing ever more powerful in Verdant," Current continued, unaware of or simply indifferent about Autumn's frown. "Communalists who think that The Silence was a beneficial realignment of kirin society, and that our treasured Way of Fire has failed us. They've even started attracting Marksists and Stallionists to their numbers. You know what those are, correct? A violent revolutionary ideology that thrives in toppling monarchy and castrating the beneficial ventures of capitalism?"\n\n"In some opinions, yes," Autumn demurred. "But I believe in the Great Leap Forward. We can incorporate everykirin's ideas into rebuilding our nation. Cooperation makes us stronger."\n\n"And divisions make us weaker. They must be stopped, and they must be crushed now before it is too late," Current urged her. "Use the power of your position to officially denounce and disperse this filthy corner of our society. Do it now, before their heresy grows, and our Matriarch Superior is the next monarch to be overthrown.""

kirin.8.t:0 "The Banners of Vermilion"
kirin.8.d:0 "Raine Shine stood in the massive plaza of the open-air Verdigris Rotunda outside of the imperial palace, counting the numerous colorful feathered banners fluttering in the slight breeze of the dreary day. A small drizzle had settled over Vermilion, and two of her palace servants used their magic to keep the rain off of her regal body, but the kirin assembled in the plaza before her stood tall, stoic, and proud. Some were young, barely more than colts and fillies, while some were older, their scales weathered and cracked with the passage of time. But one thing drew them all together, and those were the colorful banners they rallied around.\n\n"You few, you proud, gallant few," Rain Shine began, addressing the crowd with a respectful dip of her head. "You are the children, grandchildren, or even great grandchildren of the last soldiers to serve in my mother's Thousand Banners. Your ancestors served well in the Thousand Banners, and were rewarded amply with land upon which to start a family when they retired. Their children, and their children's children, served after them in the Banners. Like my own family, your families became strong military dynasties that will survive the worst the world can throw at them... even something like The Silence."\n\nHer eyes shifted to look out on the plaza, noting all the empty space unoccupied by the tiny gathering of kirin in front of her. "I summoned you here through imperial decree because it is time to rebuild the Thousand Banners of Vermilion. You will be the first to serve me, should you choose to follow in the hoofsteps of your ancestors. You will be made captains and officers, and you will protect the Realm from any threats, just as your forebears did. There are not a thousand banners standing before me, true, but I look forward to the day when this rotunda is filled with a thousand colorful banners, like a rainbow fallen onto the earth. But the first banners... they will be yours, and they will be honored by Concord's blessing. So I ask of you, kirin of the Realm: who will step forward and serve their Matriarch?"\n\nShe did not have to wait long for a response. One by one, the kirin under each banner stepped forward, carrying their banners with them for Rain Shine to bless with a touch of her magic. One by one, they knelt before her and swore their oaths to the Realm, just as their ancestors once did long ago. And one by one, Kiria earned its banners back on that day."

kirin.9.t:0 "Harmony, Heritage, Homeland"
kirin.9.d:0 "As the All-Kirin Plenum for National Revival goes on, what was originally a call for reform—Harmony, Heritage, Homeland—has become a rallying cry for the three cliques that have swiftly formed with the Plenum's maturation. Premier Autumn Blaze and her supporters advocate for Harmony, a platform of liberal reformism that seeks to align the Realm of Kiria with the ideas and tenets of the Equestrian model. Renowned priestess Winter Frost and the religious sect of the Plenum believe in the kirin heritage, seeking to remember the traditions that once made Kiria a wonderful and prosperous nation, and to remember the Way of Fire and the fire goddess Concord for bringing the oftentimes violent kirin race together into a peaceful theocracy, an ideal once thought impossible six centuries ago. Those who have made Homeland their rallying cry are led by Fickle Current, the grandson of businesskirin who fled the Realm a century ago when The Silence began, and who has now become the leading voice for the return of the kirin diaspora and literati. All three have very different ideas of how to modernize the nation and shake off the vestiges of The Silence, and in many aspects, their ideas are incompatible with each other's. As the debates and deliberations drag on, one of these factions will eventually find an edge over their competitors and win more delegates over to their side. The question now becomes the following: which faction is the one truly blessed by Concord's divine wisdom?"

kirin.10.t:0 "In the Hall of the Matriarch Superior"
kirin.10.d:0 "Matriarch Superior Rain Shine watched the delegates assemble in their seats for the day's session of the Plenum with a note of concern. What had started out as a heterogenous mixture of kirin and their ideas at the beginning of the plenum had differentiated itself into three homogenous groups as time went on, with kirin attaching themselves to cliques of like-minded individuals and all sitting grouped together. Slowly but surely, discussion and mingling between all the delegates had all but ceased, and now the delegates had firmly attached themselves to their preferred leader and ideals: Premier Autumn Blaze and her liberal reformists, Priestess Winter Frost and her traditionalist sect, and the businesskirin Fickle Current and his cabal of industrialists and literati. Those three factions had turned the free-flowing exchange of ideas into hard-fought political debates, most of which were only resolved when two cliques ganged up on the third to enforce their compromise over the other party. Her presence as Matriarch Superior forced her delegates to take a step back and calm down when they began to get angry, lest one transform into a nirik in the presence of their Matriarch, yet even still, tempers readily flared.\n\nBut even her powerful and respected presence nearly failed in controlling the assembly when the doors opened and a large procession of priests and mystics in vibrant red and gold robes entered the hall, followed by a score of poor farmers. They had barely begun to fill out a bank of empty seats before Winter Frost jumped to her hooves and spat in their direction. "Heretic!" the priestess raged, pointing a hoof directly at the fiery mare who led the procession in. "Your twisted mockery of the Way of Fire is not welcome before the sacred presence of our Matriarch Superior! Leave now, or I will drag you down the palace steps and toss you out of Vermilion myself!"\n\nWinter Frost's fellow mystics joined their voices to hers, and even some of Fickle Current's clique and Autumn Blaze's allies began to boo and hiss as the Premier struggled for control. Yet none of that seemed to disturb the newcomers' leader, who simply turned about to face Rain Shine directly and bowed low. "Divine Matriarch, my name is Rising Sun, and my followers have traveled a long way to meet you," she said. Her voice was shrewd and sweet, and when Rain Shine looked into the mare's eyes, she saw a cunning cleverness hiding in their fiery depths. "You have called, and the kirin of the west have answered. The order of the Rising Fire is here to participate in this renewal of our great nation... despite the wishes of our misguided contemporaries." At that, she raised her head from the ground and smirked at Winter Frost, whose mane had already begun to smolder as pink and red embers danced among her eyelashes. Rain Shine knew she would have to be decisive and pick her words carefully, lest the Plenum turn into a mass nirik event that hadn't been seen in a hundred years."

She didn't have to wait long for Winter Frost to speak, and frowned when the priestess waved a dismissive hoof. "The Morning Secretariat has continued to serve its function unperturbed by The Silence. The mystics have served our Matriarch Superior well, as I'm sure she can attest, and her mother before her. I move we dismiss this topic and focus on more important matters at hoof."\n\nAutumn quickly shook her head and launched into her retort. "The mystics of the Way of Fire have had sole representation to our Matriarchs for hundreds of years. During The Silence, they were so focused on meditation and spirituality that they failed to clue the Matriarch in on how the common kirin suffered under her mother's decrees. I mean, I'm pretty sure everykirin who isn't wearing robes and doesn't spend their time reading books and staring at mountains trying to figure out what Concord is trying to tell them thought it was a pretty awful time. I sure did! And The Silence wouldn't have lasted this long had the Morning Secretariat had a few voices who weren't obsessed with the Way of Fire on it. We need more diverse representation. I move that we elect a new Morning Secretariat from the members gathered here in the Plenum, to advise the Matriarch on matters of our rapidly changing state as we modernize."\n\n"I agree," Fickle Current cut in from across the room. "Our Matriarch, blessed as she is with Concord's wisdom, will not be well served by traditionalists stuck in the past, when the Realm's future is in the... well, future. I will support your plan, Premier, but in return, I ask a favor." The businesskirin made a show of clearing his throat and raised his voice to make his words clear to the rest of the Plenum. "Ever since the tragedy of 902, the merchant class has been banned from seeking audiences with the Matriarch, let alone approach her in any official capacity as an advisor. My grandparents and great-grandparents were scapegoats for what befell our nation; now, the Realm needs kirin like them, kirin like me, merchants who can provide the knowledge and capital to forge our path forward. I ask that the merchant class be allowed to serve on the Secretariat, and additionally, ten of the seventy seats will be reserved for business and industry representatives. It is they, after all, who are providing the backbone for the Realm's modernization.""

She wasn't alone in that: the rest of the kirin assembled in the Plenum audibly gasped, including some of Current's own clique, and none more so than Winter Frost's traditionalist sect. "We cannot expect business and industry to be beholden to the teachings of The Way of Fire when our religious fundamentals were laid down before modernization of today's scale was scarcely dreamed of," Current continued, pushing on with a firm voice against the agitations of the Plenum. "Modernization relies squarely on one thing, and that is the free flowing river of currency from the hooves of the buyer into the hooves of the seller. When we are talking about the modernization of the present, thousands of tons of gold will exchange hooves in a season, and all of it has to be accounted for. Splitting off a portion of this gold in tithes, as has been done for centuries, will only hamper the rapid pace of modernization. What use does Concord have for our gold, I ask you? If we are to move forward as a nation and as a society, the stranglehold Concord's temples have on our economy must be loosened for the greater good. I therefore move that the tithes be abolished and sacred lands held by temples and monasteries be opened up for public use and private investment in an effort to speed up the modernization of the Realm. The old must yield to the new if we are to see tomorrow's sunrise."\n\n"You reject tradition!" Winter Frost screamed, and Autumn felt her gut clench as the priestess briefly flickered with fire and fury. "You do not know what it means to be a kirin! You are a foreigner trying to shape our nation in the image of heathens! Have you traded Concord's divine spark for a griffon's boundless greed?"\n\nThe temperature in the Plenum was rising, both figuratively and literally, as tempers began to flare. Thankfully, it was Rain Shine who stepped forward and put a stop to the brewing catastrophe merely by standing up. When the Plenum fell silent, she narrowed her eyes at everykirin assembled.

But the Plenum could not be fair if all kirin didn't have a chance to speak, and so she let the priestess have the floor, despite her better judgment.\n\n"Thank you." Rising Sun raised her head from her bow, stepped out into the center of the Plenum, and turned to address her peers. She took only a moment to collect her thoughts before she began. "Mountains are not forever," she began, her piercing eyes slowly sweeping across the crowd. "Expecting a mountain to stand tall and resolute for ten thousand years is a foal's folly. They change with the weather, worn down season by season. What yesterday we thought was unchangeable will be tomorrow changed. So too must our teachings and our doctrines. Five centuries ago, The Way of Fire was the tallest peak in the mountain range, but it is different today that it was then. There is no shame in changing and adapting to fit the times," she said, her eyes stopping on Winter Frost for a moment before continuing on. "We must change and adapt if we want to survive. But we do not dam a river when instead it could be rerouted," she said, and this time her gaze settled on Fickle Current with a slight frown. "Common sense guides the spirit of Kiria now just as it did back then. We do not need to pretend the problems of today are the same as they were a century ago, nor do we need to pretend that we must start over if we are to combat them. The Way of Fire will learn to adapt with the forces of modernization, to work with it as a graceful dance partner, promoting equality, justice, peace, and harmony for all kirinkind. It will not be swept away by modernization, but instead will guide it to a brighter dawn. It will not abandon our sacred traditions, but seamlessly marry them to the future we create for ourselves here today. So I ask you, kirin of the Plenum, this simple question: why choose yesterday or tomorrow, when we could live together in the new today that we make for ourselves?"\n\nSomehow, Rising Fire's stirring words had moved kirin from all across the Plenum to applaud her speech. The delegates would vote as she saw fit, Autumn Blaze concluded, but she frowned as she spent a few more moments to dissect the priestess' words. She had never used the term 'The Rising Fire' to label her beliefs, but Autumn knew that it was what she'd proposed. The heretic was slowly worming new ideas into the Plenum, but there was nothing Autumn could do except hold a slight frown as Rising Sun grinned at her and the votes were cast."

The entire Plenum had been moved outside to the steps of the Vermilion Palace, where Rain Shine read her latest imperial decree to the kirin of the capital, turning its words into law with her divine voice. But those words were not hers. Instead, they were the conniving traitors' words read through the Matriarch's voice, turning blasphemy into religious creed and curtailing Concord's divine influence on the world by weakening Her avatar. It made her blood boil, but she kept it all hidden under a neutral expression. A priestess of The Way of Fire could not go against the decisions of her Matriarch, no matter how much they irked her.\n\nInstead, she directed her ire toward Fickle Current and his cronies, their pleased expressions sickening her to her stomach. Not two days had passed since Current and the rest of his Griffonia-educated ilk had proposed a charter that stripped away much of Rain Shine's power under the pretense of simplifying and codifying the Realm's governance. Her divine authority had been transformed into legal power and stolen from her court by the Morning Secretariat, which Current and his friends had a very strong hoof in. Though the charter recognized Rain Shine's divinity, reaffirming her union with Concord at her ascension when she emerged from the flames of her mother's funeral pyre, it also removed her ability to speak directly for Concord and rule by decree, instead forcing her to earn the Secretariat's consent before making a decision that would affect the Realm. While the Matriarch's court would remain open for petitioners, the matter of ruling would now be handled almost exclusively by the Morning Secretariat.\n\nWinter Frost wasted no time in separating with her clique when the decree was finished and the delegates were allowed to go their separate ways. The less time she had to spend in the traitors' presence, the better. Something would have to be done about them, she told herself, lest the Kiria she knew and loved one day ceased to be."

Though the charter recognized Rain Shine's divinity, reaffirming her union with Concord at her ascension when she emerged from the flames of her mother's funeral pyre, it also removed her ability to speak directly for Concord and rule by decree, instead forcing her to earn the Secretariat's consent before making a decision that would affect the Realm. While the Matriarch's court would remain open for petitioners, the matter of ruling would now be handled almost exclusively by the Morning Secretariat.\n\n"How foolish," Rising Sun said by Winter Frost's side. "To think mortals could bend a Goddess' divine will to their own uses... perhaps The Way of Fire has lost the way?"\n\n"Quiet, heretic," Winter Frost hissed at her. "I do not need you making today any more intolerable than it already is."\n\nRising Sun merely chuckled at that. "The Rising Fire supports our Matriarch," she said. "This charter is just an unfortunate stopgap for the challenges we face. Our way survived The Silence, and it will survive this too." She gave Winter a sly smile as she added, "Perhaps one day you and I will see eye to eye on these things. We need not be enemies, not when our way of life is at stake.""

kirin.15.d:0 "Fickle Current slowly marched up the stairs toward the burnt-out town hall, passing by scores of kirin quietly sitting amongst the ashes in protest, their glares turned toward the imperial guards gathered around the perimeter. It was only his third time visiting Fragrance, his family's ancestral hometown, but this time he came as an ally in the government, rather than an emigrant returning on family business.\n\nAs soon as the news of the unrest in Kiria's once-largest city reached Vermilion, Current had immediately volunteered his time to go and resolve the matter on the Matriarch's behalf. As the procession of automobiles navigated the dirt roads between Vermilion and Fragrance, he had taken the time to read up on any information from Fragrance he could get his hooves on. As far as the reports went, Vermilion's attempt to assert its authority over its distant urban centers had been met with resistance in Fragrance, where the city's elected council refused to cede power to the Vermilion envoys up to the moment they were forcibly removed by the envoys' guard detail. The bad blood between Fragrance and Vermilion, reaching back to the beginning of The Silence, had boiled over, and a few nirik transformations had reduced the town hall to cinders. Now, the kirin protested by peacefully sitting in the courtyard of the demolished town hall, but the conviction in their beliefs had not died down in the slightest.\n\nAfter asking around, Current shortly found himself directed to Cherry Blossom, the city's mayor and organizer behind the protests. She looked up from the papers on her table as Current approached and frowned at him. "If you're here from Vermilion, then you might as well turn around and tell the Matriarch that we won't talk until her lapdogs are gone," she growled. "Fragrance refuses to do business with the kirin that sent us from riches to rags a century ago."\n\n"What about a son of Fragrance who will turn your rags back into riches?" Current sat down across from her and set his hat down by his side. "My grandparents lost everything when The Silence ravaged our city, just like yours. But I'm back to make it right again. My friends are powerful, and they are the driving forces behind the repeal of The Silence and the return of Fragrance's industry. You have my word as a delegate of the Plenum and a devoted son of Fragrance that I will do everything in my power to return our city to its former glory by shaping Vermilion policy from within. All I ask of you is to stand back and stand by until our moment of glory comes."\n\nCherry Blossom scowled, but after a moment she nodded in agreement. "If you can save Fragrance, then by all means, do so," she said. "But know it will take a lot from Vermilion to undo a hundred years of suffering. Fragrance will not be humiliated a second time.""

kirin.16.d:0 "Autumn Blaze again touched the piece of paper rolled up and hidden inside one of the pockets in her vermilion and golden robes as she observed the festivities in the Garden of Tranquil Florescence. It had been her masterpiece of her time as premier so far, a sprawling and lively festival to welcome Kiria back into the modern world by inviting delegations from all across the world to witness the resurgence of kirin culture with the end of The Silence. Delegations from Equestria, Aquileia, Wingbardy, and the Griffonian Empire were all present, along with envoys from many other nations, all bedazzled by the spectacles of kirin folk songs and dances, pyrotechnics, gymnastics, the military drilling of the elite kirin banners, and of course, seemingly endless kirin cuisine. The past two days had all been an effort to butter up the delegates and please them before giving her speech, in which she would politely ask for assistance from foreign nations in modernizing the Realm—modernizing a nation as large and disparate as Kiria within a few years would be impossible without outside help, after all. Hopefully, the foreign envoys would be able to secure favorable terms with their governments if they left Kiria pleased and amazed with what they saw.\n\nBut as Autumn prepared to give the speech, she still found herself wrestling with how to request foreign aid. Winter Frost and the traditionalists had pressured her to take a more moderate approach, to advocate for the righteousness of The Way of Fire and its tenet of living in harmony with nature rather than conquering it. Fickle Current, however, had urged her to found her request on Kiria's abundance of natural resources, simply waiting for foreign capital to be exploited and traded around the world. It left Autumn in an uncomfortable position: should she ask for help based on good faith and favors, or exchange the resources of her home for the money of foreigners?"

kirin.17.t:0 "A Missive from Hyacinth"
kirin.17.d:0 "To Premier Autumn Blaze,\n\nI am sending you this urgent message requesting support for the kirin of Hyacinth in recovering from a pirate attack. According to the locals, about three days before our imperial delegation arrived in the city to reassert the Matriarch Superior's authority over the coastal town, a large pirate armada appeared on the horizon and quickly stormed the port. The pirates swiftly blockaded the port, disembarked from their ships, and stripped the town bare of any and all valuables the townsfolk possessed, even pressing some of the villagers into service aboard their ships before disembarking again. Such raids are not uncommon, the villagers tell me, and have been a somewhat regular occurrence for decades, ever since a large pirate haven was established on the Auburn Isle just off of Hyacinth's coast. The pirates do not kill or burn, I am told, as they treat the coastal villages like fruit bearing trees to be cultivated and harvested when the time is right, yet the frequent raids on these villages have stifled their growth and left them too weak to fend for themselves.\n\nEvery village I visited along the coast told similar stories. It is clear that something needs to be done, but until we can rebuild a navy of our own, it seems unlikely that anything CAN be done. How are we supposed to reassert the Matriarch's divine rule over all the Realm if we cannot protect those living on our coasts? One way or another, these pirates must be brought to heel and their armada disbanded. It is the only way to create peace and prosperity for the fishing villages and harbor towns along the coast. Until the pirate menace is dealt with, we will struggle to truly end The Silence in all of Kiria, and our efforts at modernization will never be successful.\n\nPlease bring this matter to the Matriarch Superior's attention at the first chance you get. Her subjects depend on it.\n\nOur Matriarch's loyal servant,\nFirecracker"

kirin.18.d:0 ""The Plenum now moves onto the matter of the evaluation of laws passed as part of The Silence's decrees," Autumn Blaze said, pulling the next proposal across her desk and skimming over the brief attached to it. "Fickle Current, since this is your proposal, how about you get us started off?"\n\n"Gladly," the industrialist said and, standing up, he took the podium to address his fellow delegates. "Members of the Plenum, we have already gone so far in revoking and repealing many of the ill-advised decrees that constituted the hundred year decay that brought our nation to where it stands today," he said. "The faults in these decrees were easy to see and were dismissed accordingly; likewise, the laws that filled in the spaces between Matriarch Noctilucent Charm's decrees should also be removed. Some of these laws explicitly ban little things like singing, dancing, and loud talking in public, and I think even priestess Winter Frost will agree with me that these measures are archaic and unnecessary in today's Kiria. Other laws, such as the banning of independent hierarchical organizations and capital punishment for nirik transformations, though seldom enforced, should likewise be removed. We must allow our society to grow with our nation, and these restrictions instead stunt it. Make nirik transformation a misdemeanor like public intoxication and do away with the rest, and we will be one step closer to a functional modern society."\n\nThough most kirin nodded in agreement, Winter Frost rose to voice her counterpoints, just as Autumn Blaze knew the priestess would. "While I may personally agree that some of these restrictions are trivial, were they not Concord's divine intention, passed through her previous avatar, Matriarch Charm?" she began. "Removing them would be blasphemy, and it is not up to us to decide what should be done. That is Matriarch Rain Shine's decision, not ours. But I must outright reject your proposal to remove the capital punishment on nirik transformations, Current, even if it has only been loosely enforced for the past few decades. We need a strong deterrent to prevent the transformation into the nirik state, now more than ever. Remove that and we only feed more fuel to the fire. Tempers will flare, and another bout of nirik transformations will be the calamity that sees all our progress permanently undone. It is not a risk we can afford to take, and so the only way to control it is to punish it with the harshest penalty imaginable. So, kirin of the Plenum, do we abandon the safeguards that prevented the complete destruction of our nation a century ago, or do we remember our traditions and the reasons why these safeguards were implemented in the first place?""

kirin.19.t:0 "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom"
kirin.19.d_1:0 "It was a nice change of pace, Autumn Blaze calmly noted, to be able to gather with the leaders of the other factions and enjoy dinner and drinks together after a hard day of hammering out policy and reform at the Plenum. It wasn't every day that the clique leaders could put aside their differences and enjoy a meal together—Winter Frost and Fickle Current certainly weren't inviting each other over for tea after a long day arguing—but on the rare days when the Plenum could pass its agenda nearly unanimously (or at least without heated arguments), Autumn liked to take the two out for dinner afterwards and relax. It helped to remind everykirin that they were all kirin and partners in this endeavor, not enemies to be defeated.\n\n"I think we can all agree that the ending of the Quiescence was for the betterment of our realm," Fickle Current said as they waited for their meals to be brought out to them. "One by one, we've rolled back Matriarch Noctilucent Charm's decrees that stifled our education system and banned the study of science, religion, and philosophy outside of what we already knew in 903. That's the mark of progress, right there."\n\n"The new freedom of information is helping us unravel more of Concord's mysteries," Winter Frost agreed. "Concord lives in science and philosophy as much as she does in our religion. The Way of Fire is not merely a matter of theology, it is the foundation of our society and everything that we do. Exploring how Concord's divinity influences the natural world around us is just as important as understanding how we can better strive to follow her teachings."\n\n"I recently read a report that came across my desk saying that the number of schools in the realm has multiplied a hundredfold in such a short time," Autumn added. "More kirin are gaining the gift of education than ever before, and at a higher quality than even we thought imaginable when we first started. That's cause for celebration, I think."\n\n"Agreed," Current said, and he lifted up his drink in his magic, prompting Autumn and Winter to do the same. "A toast, then, to Kiria's progress. We are making a dream that once seemed impossible into tomorrow's reality.""
kirin.19.d_2:0 "It was usually a nice change of pace, Autumn Blaze noted, to gather her fellow leaders of the Plenum together for dinner after a successful and (mostly) argument-free day. It was a good way to remind everykirin that they were all on the same team and all wanted to modernize Kiria; just because they had different ideas on how to go about it, they weren't supposed to be enemies in this process. She had hoped that today would be another one of those days, where Winter Frost and Fickle Current could stop going at each other's throats for an evening over a shared enjoyment of a good meal, but it was clear that things weren't going according to plan.\n\n"Repealing the Quiescence was supposed to be a good step forward," Winter Frost bemoaned. "Opening up the study of science, religion, and philosophy was supposed to foster a renewed vigor in the exploration of The Way of Fire. But Rising Sun and her heretics have hijacked it for their own agenda! They're using modern printing presses to print thousands of copies of Her Incandescent Will, a text that was banned for good reason before The Silence, under the guise of freedom of speech! They twist Concord's divine will to suit their own heretical interpretations of a communalistic society. Who knows how many righteous followers that harlot has corrupted with her blasphemy? She should have been run out of Vermilion the moment she showed her face in the Matriarch's holy presence!"\n\nFickle Current remained unsympathetic. "Perhaps if your fellow mystics did not shun progress, Rising Sun would not be outcompeting you," he said. "You fear printing presses and the inventions of modern society. You try to copy the teachings of The Way of Fire by hoof and horn with quill and ink, and act surprised when Rising Sun's followers print a thousand copies of her texts for every one of yours? Perhaps this is why The Way of Fire is losing influence while The Rising Fire grows ever stronger."\n\nWinter Frost slammed her hooves down on the table and abruptly stood up, glaring at Fickle Current. "If you will not support Concord's teachings and her holy will, then I will not share a meal with you," she growled, much to Autumn's dismay. "I am leaving." She turned to Autumn only to say "Good night, Premier," then stormed out of the restaurant without waiting for her meal to arrive. Fickle Current merely shrugged and watched her go, keeping his thoughts to himself."

She was about to set it aside and try again later when the door to her study opened and a brown kirin stepped in with a fresh stack of papers for the Premier to look at. When the newcomer saw Autumn's exasperation, however, she paused in the doorway and frowned. "Autumn? Is this a bad time?"\n\nAutumn sighed and waved the kirin in. "No, Cinder Glow, it's not. I've just been beating my face against the table for Concord knows how many hours now, and I've gotten basically nowhere with this draft of our new constitution!" She let out a groan and slouched back in her seat. "This is nothing like writing up musicals back in Massicot!"\n\nCinder Glow bit her lip and stepped closer. "What's the problem, then?" she asked her premier and party leader. "Read it out to me. Maybe that will help you figure some things out."\n\n"Well, it's worth a shot, at least." Autumn took a deep breath, sat upright, and pulled out her stack of notes. "I've been trying to work everykirin's concerns into the new constitution, and that's going fine, I guess. The executive power of our Matriarch, her court, and the Reform Bureau, which is my responsibility to lead, is pretty cut and dry. The Morning Secretariat's legislative abilities are fine too. But it's the whole thing with the courts. Back in the day, legal disputes were settled by priests who determined which party Concord favored, but you can imagine just how big of a problem that becomes if a priest isn't the most morally inclined of kirin. Current and his allies want to just import Griffonian judicial law wholesale, and he points to how it's been set up in Fragrance as an example of it in action. But Griffonian society is entirely different from kirin society; how can we just import that without considering our own heritage? And of course, Winter Frost wants things to stay exactly how they are..."\n\n"You might just have to favor one or the other as the starting point for the bill," Cinder Glow offered. "Either use The Way of Fire as the basis, or Griffonian law, and work backwards from there to reach a good enough compromise for kirin society. It'll definitely favor one side more than the other, but finding a compromise that makes everykirin happy ends up making nokirin happy, right?""

It was one of three early dreadnoughts that had formed the backbone of the Vermilion Armada before the Silence, and when it was scuttled along with its two sister ships, it had been one of the most advanced seafaring vessels in the world. Nowadays it would have been horrifically obsolete, of course, but some salvage and retrofitting would turn it into a serviceable, if outdated, foundation for a new Vermilion Armada.\n\nThe history of the ships was something that every foal of Fragrance knew well, and Current was no exception.

Soldiers from Vermilion had suppressed the mutiny and retook most of the mothballed ships, immediately scuttling them to prevent a second mutiny. It was just another insult in a long list from the imperial capital, and the message it sent was crystal clear: Vermilion expected Fragrance to quietly huddle up and die, and any attempts the city made to save itself were treason.

kirin.22.d:0 "Winter Frost tongued the inside of her cheek in contemplative thought as she watched the latest ship from Griffonia sail into port. It was a cargo freighter loaded with goods from the griffon lands, but Winter was more interested in the creatures on it. Some were griffons, a few were ponies, but most were kirin. They were all employed by the Sycee Trading House, one of Kiria's oldest trading houses, yet few of the kirin on board had ever seen their ancestral homelands. Sycee fled the Realm with its businesses when The Silence started, and had maintained its success overseas by employing members of the kirin diaspora to sail its ships and to protect them with their lives. It too was coming home, just like its employees, and Kiria had Fickle Current to thank for that.\n\nWinter herself wasn't as thankful as the rest of the Plenum about that. Sycee was brought back because it had experience fending off pirates and protecting its cargo with well-trained seafarer marines, and Kiria had a pirate problem on Auburn Isle. Kiria needed the return of Sycee's business to establish foreign trade and to use its marines as a stopgap measure until it could train its own army and navy. But this was Fickle Current's work, and everything that kirin did was done with his friends' best interests on his mind, interests that seemed to frequently overlap with making more money. While the marines might officially have been placed under the command of the Vermilion Banner Army, Winter doubted that their loyalties moved as quickly as their supposed allegiance. Were these kirin truly ready to serve their Matriarch, or were they still the Sycee Trading House's creatures? If push came to shove, Winter wasn't sure she wanted to be in the room when the Realm found out.\n\nOne thing was certain, she knew. Fickle and his cronies were strengthening their own position while addressing the Realm's problems. Winter and her fellow mystics would have to keep pace if they wanted to keep the heart and soul of Kiria firmly devoted to Concord and Her Matriarch."

They held signs and chanted slogans, and one of them had gathered a sizable pile of rocks that could easily be turned into missiles at a moment's notice. Though soot and smog hung in the Fragrance air, the factory behind them was unmistakably silent, the gears of modernity ground to a halt by the striking workers.\n\nCurrent frowned and stepped out of the car, moving along behind the cordon of private detectives and security staff that had assembled to face the striking workers. He found Cypress Snow watching from a vantage point, a similarly displeased look on his face. The two nodded at each other in greeting, and then both turned their attention to the striking workers. "They don't have any Rising Fire priests with them," Fickle noted.\n\n"It's not the communalist heretics this time," Cypress said, shaking his head. "It's just the workers unionizing and sharing subversive leftist literature. They most have gotten it from Stalliongrad, or Prywhen, or Skynavia. Where it came from, it doesn't matter. What does matter is that it's here now, and it's filling their heads with nonsense."\n\n"Then it looks like the Rising Fire has a modern competitor, and we have a nuisance to deal with." The sight of the protesting workers and the sounds of their chants took Current back to his days in Skyfall, where he had seen similar unrest play out before. "We know the playbook then. This is nothing we haven't dealt with in Skyfall."\n\n"Right. We bring in scabs from someplace rural and tell them they're getting good-paying jobs, which will let the factory get cheap replacement for the strikers. Then we kick the squatters out and crack some skulls if we have to. The company's pockets are deep enough to get some mercenaries together for a raid. Maybe Sycee will be willing to part with some of its marines for a bit." Cypress then turned to Fickle and frowned. "But we have to get control of this now and stamp the movement out before it gets worse. We know how this goes, because we've seen it before. We'll have to be proactive here, not reactive.

Setting it aside, the businesskirin climbed up to the top deck, dodging a few sailors hurriedly moving up and down the stairs leading into the ship's hull, and found a spot along the port side of the ship, where a marine squinted out over the waters with a frown. "Ships?" Current asked him, spotting three outdated junks sailing towards the steamer. "Are they pirates?"\n\n"We're close to Hyacinth, so aye, likely," the marine responded. "They aren't answering our signals, so they're likely part of the Nacre Armada. Not to worry, though. The forward gun on this ship can turn them all into splinters before we get in range of their muskets and cannons.\n\nFickle nodded, his ears flattening as the steamer's forward gun let loose a warning shot to ward off the approaching ships, the shell creating a plume of frothy white water where it landed. He supposed he should have expected some excitement during the trip from Fragrance to Hyacinth; the pirates were likely to be agitated with all the ship traffic sailing to the port in preparation for the attack on Auburn Isle. As he watched, the junks threw up the black flag, though one barely had a chance to raise it to the top of its mast before a kill shot from the steamer's gun crumpled the wooden hull in on itself. The marines let out a cheer, even as futile musket shot from the surviving junks began to splash the water off the steamer's port side, though that abruptly stopped when a booming clang rang out and the ship lurched to port, sending Fickle Current tumbling to the side.\n\n"Submarine!" somekirin yelled, but it was too late. The submarine had surfaced from directly underneath the steamer, and from its hatches burst forth a swarm of pirates, armed to the teeth with swords and antiquated firearms. Ropes flew up over the starboard rails, and the subsequent onslaught of the pirate boarding party overwhelmed the marines, who could only muster a token resistance before they lost the deck.\n\nFleeing from the carnage, Fickle stumbled through the steamer's narrow corridors, sighing in relief as he ran into a quartet of sailors armed with rifles and bayonets, prepared to fight on in a rearguard action belowdecks. But hurtling out of a side corridor was a mare garbed in splendid raiment with two swords held aloft in her magic, falling upon the unprepared sailors with her twirling blades and cutting them down in a flurry of steel. She grinned as Current tried to slide to a stop, and before he could run the other way, spun one of her swords around in her magical grip and smashed the pommel against the scales under his horn."

kirin.25.t:0 "The Matriarch of the Auburn Isle"
kirin.25.d:0 "Fickle Current sat in the corner of his dark cell, wondering how much time had passed since his last meal of stale bread and rice wine. He'd awoken in the black abyss convinced he was dead, and it wasn't until the heavy metal door opened for his first meal that he'd seen any light. But apart from when a slot in the door opened to give him his meals, it was barred shut. The walls of the cell were all brick, and the one time he had managed to work himself up into enough of a rage to try and tap into the nirik taboo to burn a way out of his cell, he couldn't find a flammable weak spot to set fire to. All he'd accomplished was burning away his suit to ashes, and the experience had left him dizzy, disoriented, and sick afterwards. Another attempt was off the table.\n\nHoofsteps approached, and Current looked up, turning to where he thought the door was supposed to be. Keys turned in the lock, and the door squealed on rusty hinges as it opened outwards. Torchlight blinded the stallion, and he had to cover his face for a few moments to let his eyes adjust to the sudden light. When he could see again, he looked up to see a kirin mare standing over him, and he quickly realized it was the same one who had knocked him out during the ambush. "You," he croaked, recoiling slightly from her. "What do you want? What happened to the crew? To the ship?"\n\nHis response was a biting slap across his face, hard enough to rattle his teeth together. "Quiet, and listen," the mare said, frowning at him. "My name is Roaring Fire. The pirates of the Auburn Isle sail under my command, and the kirin of Nacre call me their matriarch and protector. I have come to bargain." Roaring Fire gestured vaguely to the outside world. "Your friends in Fragrance paid your ransom, and so I am letting you go. A ship will take you back to Hyacinth, where your navy is waiting to put its hoof to my neck and break the back of my armada. That is a fight I cannot win. But I know you are also staring down a fight you cannot win, and so I want to make a deal." She squatted down and thought her next words over carefully, the jewelry in her mane jingling faintly in the darkness of the cell. "I don't just have buccaneers, I have spies. And I know what is happening back in the mainland. I know all about the reforms, the struggle, the strife... and I know what you want, Fickle Current. I know that the NAKP is training paramilitaries and preparing for the worst. And should the worst come to pass... wouldn't it be better to have more friends on your side than enemies?"\n\nShe dug through her robes and pulled out a white candle with a jade wick. "This candle has been enchanted by dragon fire. Burn a message in it, and I will receive it. Your navy will take Auburn Isle, but they will not find my armada here. But rest assured, I will answer the call, should you send it to me.""

kirin.26.d_1:0 "Fickle Current watched from the bow of an armored junk as the Fragrant Flotilla steamed into Nacre's harbor, their marines quickly seizing control of the docks and allowing the larger troop transports to dock and disgorge their troops. But he soon realized there was no fight to be had; the pirates were already long gone, just as Roaring Fire had promised, and not a shot was fired in the capture of the island. The prancing kirin banner of the Vermilion Realm soon replaced the black flag hanging from the flagpole in the center of Nacre, and the marines let out a cheer while the townsfolk sullenly watched their home fall to the invaders, their once mighty pirate armada having abandoned them.\n\n"Guess even pirates know when a fight's lost," the junk's captain remarked to Current from his side. "Smart move on their part. The Flotilla would have broken that fleet into driftwood, even if they had a submarine hiding in it. Without their base in Nacre, the armada's going to fracture and wither away. We'll have a couple more raids I'm sure, but their glory days are done."\n\nCurrent silently nodded along, remembering the offer Roaring Fire made him, and how he'd spurned it. She'd been enraged and had nearly turned nirik on him, but had enough common sense to realize when she was beat and to cut her losses and run. He doubted he'd seen the last of her, but even if he hadn't, it wouldn't be too long before somekirin did her in. The captain was right; without Nacre to supply her armada, Roaring Fire's days were numbered, hers and the rest of her pirate brethren.\n\nIt was another victory for the NAKP and the Realm as a whole."

Roaring Fire had let them take Nacre, on the assumption that she'd one day get it back. Doubtless that would be what she would ask for in return for her services to the NAKP; she'd make a useful governor at any rate, given how the kirin of Nacre loved her. In the meanwhile, she would take her armada to some other hideaway and lay low for a while, maybe sustaining herself off of raiding the Zebrides and the Zebrican southeast until Current called for her. He absentmindedly touched the small candle tucked away in his suit. One letter and a spark of fire, and he'd have the entirety of Roaring Fire's armada at his disposal.\n\nThe board was set and the pieces were in position.

kirin.27.d:0 "It only took Current a few moments to make up his mind, and he took the candle from Roaring Fire and snapped it in two with his magic before crushing the wax into the ground. "I am a proud son of Fragrance," he proclaimed, sternly scowling at Roaring Fire. "I am a reputable businesskirin and I will not stoop so low as to consorting with criminal scum to get what I need. I do not need you, and so I will not dirty myself with your help."\n\nRoaring Fire bared her teeth, and red flames began to lick at the edges of her mane. Her eyes turned piercing white, and her teeth elongated into vicious daggers as her rage started to consume her. "Insolent fool!" she growled, her voice taking on a demonic edge as she slipped closer to the nirik state. "I should flay you alive! Hammer nails under your scales and peel them off one by one! You will know pain when I am through with you!"\n\nBut Current stood his ground. "You would not dare hurt me," he stated. "If you lay a hoof on me, your armada will be hunted to the ends of the earth. You can flee from Nacre, but my friends will make sure every single one of your ships is found and sunk, and every single one of your pirates is executed for their crimes. Face it; the age of piracy is over. You are a dying breed, a last gasp of a lawless time. But I am the face of law and order in Kiria. I am the face of progress. I am the face of the future. And the future does not need you anymore."\n\nHe stood up and looked down his muzzle at the angry pirate captain before him. "You gambled everything on this, didn't you?" he asked her. "You wanted to kidnap me, to try and convince me of my own desperation so you could make a career change and be my mercenaries? We do not need more mercenaries. We can afford trained professionals should we need it, not an undisciplined pirate rabble. No, you will not save yourself this way. The only way you save yourself is to let me go, take your ransom, and try to start again somewhere else. I know it. You know it. Now let's stop dancing around the point anymore, shall we?"\n\nEven after all that, Current still harbored a little worry at seeing the half-transformed nirik in front of him, but after a few moments, the flames went out and Roaring Fire returned to her kirin form. "Fine," she spat, turning away from him. "Have it your way then. Pray that you never see me again, Current, because you do not want to see what happens when you trap a pirate like a caged animal.""

kirin.28.d:0 "Is something wrong, Premier? You've barely touched your tea." Fickle Current raised an eyebrow as Autumn Blaze held her teacup in her magic, staring at but not really drinking her oolong. "If something has come up that is bothering you, speak freely. You shoulder a great deal of responsibility as premier, yet you do not have to tackle everything alone. I may be able to offer advice."\n\nAutumn sighed and set her teacup down. "Kiria is about to fall into famine," she said in a dour tone. "Fragrance and Rhapsody have urbanized so rapidly with the returning diaspora that they're draining our granaries and warehouses months faster than originally planned. Our population is beginning to boom while fewer kirin work the fields now than they did in the Silence. Agricultural output isn't keeping up, and unless this year's harvest doubles last year's, kirin will starve come the winter."\n\n"We need to modernize our farming techniques alongside our society," Current swiftly concluded. "Neither you nor I are farmers, but I did learn of new techniques being developed in Griffonia before I left. One of the more interesting ones was close planting. Triple the density of seedlings in a plot, then double it once the first batch has had time to settle into the soil. The thought is that plants of the same species won't compete against each other, returning greater yields from smaller plots of land. Alongside that, we can try deep plowing the fields. The soil at the top of the earth is what crops use up year after year, draining it of fertility until it becomes barren dust. But plow deeper, and more fertile, untouched soil may be found. That would ensure healthy yields for our farmers."\n\nAutumn chewed on her lip as she tried to determine if what Current was saying was actually making sense. "Do you have any evidence that worked in Griffonia? At any rate, I don't want to make decisions about this without feedback from the Morning Secretariat. We should talk with kirin that know what they're dealing with."\n\n"Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't the first planting season start soon?" When Autumn nodded, he continued. "The Morning Secretariat is slow. Dreadfully so. I appreciate the merits in sussing out the finer details of the proposals that cross its floor, but it sounds like we don't have time to wait on them. If we're going to adopt these techniques, a decision needs to be made now before the farmers start planting. At any rate, the Sorghum Foundry owns large plots of farmland in Peace-and-Plenty. I can commandeer their farms to test the techniques for you before the second planting season.""

kirin.29.t:0 "Altering the Deal"
kirin.29.d_1:0 "Autumn Blaze cringed as she finished her plea to the plenum only to be drowned out by a chorus of unhappy voices. She had taken to the stand to ask for the Plenum's support in extending the Hyacinth Accords with Equestria, a deal that had been very helpful in funding the Three and a Half Year Plan so far, but was deeply unpopular with both Fickle Current's and Winter Frost's cliques. Now, after arguing that a renewal of the Accords would give Kiria more funding and more resources to successfully finish the Plan, she found herself met with nothing short of revolt by the other two parties in the Plenum.\n\n"You would give Equestria a greater share of our resources, a greater control over our nation's wealth, a greater influence in the lives of every kirin in this country?" Fickle Current asked her. "Our material wealth is precious to us, and when a nation has nothing left, it at least has the resources within its own lands. We will not be turned into beggars at the Equestrian table! I will not stand for it!"\n\n"And neither will I," Winter Frost cut in. "We are a nation supported by the strength of our faith in Concord and The Way of Fire. What we are lacking is not material tools, but faith! The Equestrians do not worship Concord; they do not believe in The Way of Fire. How are we supposed to create a righteous nation if we stray from the divine will of our goddess to do so?"\n\n"We are not sacrificing anything!" Autumn protested. "We are exchanging something we have plenty of for something we have little of! The Equestrians are honest, forthcoming, and reasonable. The Reform Bureau has already made great progress on preliminary talks! The terms the Equestrians offer us are generous and honest; they favor us more than they favor them. Do not turn your backs on help that we need because we are too proud to take it!"\n\nBut Autumn Blaze could do nothing now; she could tell that the kirin in the Plenum had already made up their minds. As delegates left their seats to cast their votes and a scribe tallied them up, Autumn could only gnaw on her hooves in worry and hope that she had been persuasive enough to sell the deal."

We've modernized faster than any nation in the world ever has, and that's a terrific accomplishment by itself. The life of every kirin in the Realm is growing better with each passing day as we shake off the last vestiges of the Silence. But I'm not going to sugarcoat it for anykirin here, though. Kiria is strained in a way it never has been before. There's so much social upheaval and cultural change that we're enduring that if we're not careful, the entire Realm could come crashing down around us. But I'm confident that we can do this without breaking our nation. We've come this far, and we won't trip and fall on our faces before we cross the finish line. With a renewed commitment to the Plenum and to Kiria, we can do this! I know we can! So please, don't give up yet! There's still so much work to do!"\n\nFickle Current quietly shook his head as Autumn's plea was met with a mild smattering of applause. "We'll never succeed with somekirin as incompetent as her in charge," he remarked to Cypress Snow, who sat next to him. "This project was too ambitious for a naive political newcomer like her. She only earned the position because she befriended the Matriarch. Rain Shine's foolish nepotism will be Kiria's undoing."\n\nCypress hummed in thought, but shook his head. "This is the most complex project perhaps any nation has undertaken in recorded history," Current's old mentor mused. "She may not be the right mare for the job, but I would be surprised if anykirin could have completed the plan in time. Faster and more efficiently, perhaps, but drawbacks like this are hardly unexpected. And to be fair to her, she has outperformed my expectations."\n\n"That won't be enough to save Kiria," Current countered. He frowned and leaned back in his seat as Autumn gathered up her papers and left the podium for the next speaker. "But I don't see a change happening any time soon.

It is my right as the chairkirin of the NAKP!"\n\nCypress flinched back and tapped his hooves together, noting the partial elongation of Current's fangs and the smoky flickering of his mane as his rage threatened to overwhelm him. "Breathe, Current," Cypress began, gently placing a hoof down on his desk. "Remember our exercises. The nirik state is unbefitting kirin like ourselves." As Current slowly calmed himself down, Cypress continued trying to soothe his former student's hurt pride. "You are still the leader of the NAKP in the Morning Secretariat. Nokirin is going to take that from you. Your party believes in you, and you have our absolute loyalty. At any rate, the appointment is not something that we can undo. Rain Shine's advisors are appointed and dismissed at her leisure. Give her time, state your case, and you may find yourself back by her right hoof in no time."\n\n"This should never have happened in the first place," Current fumed. "My authority is built on my skills and my value. What does it say about me and the NAKP if I am so easily replaced? I cannot hold our party together without the legal authority that comes from being Rain Shine's right hoof. I must have my seat back, or Kiria will move on without me.""

Her parents had been as thrilled and ecstatic about her accomplishments as ever, but even for the ever-talkative Autumn, she needed a little bit of time to herself to relax her mind and take a break. So, spying the hill she used to sled down in the winter, Autumn turned toward it and began to walk up its grassy slopes, humming to herself as she walked.\n\nIt had been an exhausting few weeks, but everywhere in Massicot, the decorations hung from buildings and strung between rooftops served as an easy reminder of the fruits of her labor. She had just finished a chaotic two weeks of trying to organize the mid-autumn festival as a national holiday, a task that, coupled with her usual duties, had left her mentally drained by the time the Matriarch had given her permission to return to Massicot and celebrate the festival with her family. The festival was in full swing, and the streets were filled with music and singing and laughter, but away from town, under the full moon, the world was quiet and peaceful.\n\nWhen she climbed the hill, however, she was surprised to find her friend Fern Flare sitting there, having a picnic dinner as she watched foals chase each other through the meadow with paper lanterns while their parents relaxed nearby. She didn't so much announce her presence as she did walk over to Fern's blanket and flop down onto it with a groan, and Fern only chuckled as she offered Autumn a mooncake. "Busy day, premier?"\n\n"Please, for the love of Concord, do not call me that tonight," Autumn groaned, taking the mooncake and biting into it. It was delicious, just as she remembered, and it put a little bit of energy back into her. But having Fern use her official title made her frown. "Fern? You ever feel like there's a huge weight on our shoulders that's gonna crush us flat if we take one wrong step? Because I do. All of Kiria is depending on me to hold things together. I'm the one standing between this happy night and civil war. I have nightmares about the Plenum erupting into a chaotic inferno, of riots in the streets, of our home burning to the ground. It's just... it's a lot, you know? It's almost too much for one mare to bear."\n\n"Then it's a good thing you're not just one mare, Autumn," Fern said. "We're all with you. You've got the Matriarch on your side. You can do this. If ever there was a mare for the job, it's you." Then she smiled at her. "Now come on, cheer up.

She trusted them to give her the news straight, and the looks on their faces told her that she wasn't going to like what they had to say.\n\n"The Realm is growing more unstable by the day," Fern Flare said. "Farmers are protesting against the rapid changes to society. Laborers are protesting that they aren't being treated fairly. The returning diaspora is protesting that we aren't modernizing fast enough for their liking. When those protests clash, riots start. And I think it goes without saying that where kirin are rioting, nirik soon appear. Urbanization and industrial projects are getting damaged by angry nirik setting fire to the construction zones, wasting investment money that we really need. Not to mention our bouts with famine, pollution, and pirates..."\n\n"I think she gets the point," Cinder Glow said, putting a hoof on Fern Flare's shoulder and shaking her head. Then she turned to Autumn. "In short, the realm is in turmoil. We have to do something to get cooler heads to prevail and get everykirin back on the same page. Everything we're doing is pulling our people apart into different tribes and factions. We need to remind them that we're all in this together, for the good of our country."\n\n"Yeah," Autumn said, rubbing her hoof against her nose scales as she thought.

"What's one thing we all share in common as kirin of the Realm? Our love for our Matriarch! The Realm wouldn't exist without her, and we owe her respect, not just because of the job she's doing, but because she's Concord's avatar in this world. I may have flunked out of mystic school, but even I know that Concord made Rain Shine one with her divinity when she ascended. So why don't we send her on tour across the Realm to visit the big cities and the little villages, and remind the kirin of Kiria that so long as Rain Shine walks among us, we still have Concord's favor!"\n\n"Do you really think it will work?" Fern Flare asked. "I don't see that solving all of our problems. For all her divinity and power, Matriarch Rain Shine can't simply wave her hoof and make the Realm's problems go away."\n\n"No, but it will buy us the time we need," Autumn said.

Cultural upheaval was everywhere and clashes between tradition and modernization were commonplace. The eastern coast, particularly the cities of Fragrance and Rhapsody, had practically turned into warzones between locals and the diaspora, with reports that nationalist paramilitaries had organized and orchestrated coups against the Matriarch's appointed governors, installing their leaders in their steads. But despite the chaos in the east, the populace their still paid lip service to Rain Shine as her subjects, unlike the west. There, in the rural and underdeveloped stretches of Kiria, the heretical sect of The Rising Fire had engaged in open rebellion against Rain Shine's rule. Clashes between imperial banners and local militias had put a dark mood over the Secretariat, and the situation only seemed to be growing more dire. And throughout it all, reports of nirik transformations and raging fires had come in from all across the nation. Kiria was dying.\n\nRain Shine excused herself from the Secretariat, having heard enough bad news for the day, and wandered the halls of her grand palace alone. She had done this to Kiria; she was the one responsible for this failure. She had tried to cram a century's worth of lost progress into three years of reform, and it had blown up in her face. She had created a dilemma worse than the one her mother faced, and now, for the first time, she understood why The Silence had been enacted at all.

Cultural upheaval was everywhere and clashes between tradition and modernization were commonplace. The eastern coast, particularly the cities of Fragrance and Rhapsody, had practically turned into warzones between locals and the diaspora, with reports that nationalist paramilitaries had organized and orchestrated coups against the Matriarch's appointed governors, installing their leaders in their steads.\n\nBut there was still a spark of hope in the Secretariat, one last spark that had yet to be snuffed out. That spark was Rising Sun as she took the podium before her peers. "The east may have forgotten who they are, but the west stands firm," she proclaimed. "The Rising Fire supports our Matriarch, and so long as I have a seat on this Secretariat, we will support Kiria. But time is of the essence if we want to do this right. The Realm is fracturing, and nirik transformations are becoming more commonplace. If we don't right the ship now, even I won't be able to satisfy the demands for reform coming from the west. Kiria will be broken within a month if we don't do something to fix it, so we must. For the good of the realm."\n\nRain Shine silently nodded along as Rising Sun's words stirred up one last bit of resolve in the Secretariat. There was still a chance to save Kiria. They couldn't afford to waste it."

kirin.102.t:0 "The Matriarch on Tour"
kirin.102.d_1:0 "It was good to be home, Rain Shine thought to herself as her servants set her palanquin down in the courtyard inside her palace. She had just returned from a successful tour of the Realm, the first she'd undertaken in her long life of seventy-some odd years, and had seen a whole new Realm she couldn't have imagined after spending almost all of those years inside the Vermilion palace. When her premier had brought the idea of a country tour to her she had at first been skeptical, but soon warmed to the idea. Now, she was glad that she had done it; the memories of what she'd seen would stick with her for the rest of her days, and they were happy memories as well.\n\nFrom Vermilion, Rain Shine had insisted on making the trek through the mountains to Rhapsody, along the path where the Vermilion Priestess and eventual first Matriarch Superior, Iridescent Dawn, had once walked on her journey to commune with Concord. From there, she traveled to Fragrance and up the Comely Cape until she boarded a steamer that took her to Hyacinth, allowing her to appreciate the marvels of modern engineering that Kiria had missed in its century-long stagnation. From Hyacinth she went to Massicot, then sailed down the Great Mellifluve to Sorghum and Vernant, with a detour to Chrysanthemum along the way. At every stop, she had been greeted by throngs of awed and overjoyed kirin, their emotion and faith in their Matriarch Superior overcoming the divides of status. Rich and poor, mystic and heretic, local or diaspora returnee, all gathered by along the roads, cheering their divine Matriarch and supplicating themselves before her.\n\nIt had been an overwhelming experience for the Matriarch, sure, but it had been worth it. Rain Shine had visited all the new advances happening under her watch, from new schools to modern hospitals to revitalized fire pagodas proclaiming a new dawn for The Way of Fire. She had seen firsthoof the rapid progress of modernization, the advancement of industry, the transformation of the poor kirin countryside into a land of rich opportunities, waiting for its moment to claim its glory under the sun. But she had also seen cracks in the facade, where the dark tendrils of strife wound its way between the growing cracks of kirin society and politics. For as far as the Realm had come under her watch, it still had much farther to go, and injustices beyond measure to rectify.\n\nBut rectify them she would, she knew. With the tour complete, she had seen what she needed to see in her Realm. She had seen the wheels of progress turning, and the conflict that strove to grind them to a halt. And, Concord willing, she would do everything in her power to drive them onwards. Her little kirin depended on it, after all, and Rain Shine was determined to never fail her subjects in the way her mother had once failed them."
kirin.102.d_2:0 "Rain Shine waved from her palanquin at the gathered crowds in the city of Persimon, full of kirin who had gathered along the streets just to catch a glimpse of their divine Matriarch Superior make her first journey outside of the Vermilion palace in all her life. At her premier's urging, Rain Shine and her palace staff had established an itinerary of cities to visit throughout the Realm to show the kirin of Kiria that their Matriarch still held the divine favor of Concord and looked admirably upon the work they were doing in the Great Leap Forward. So far, she had visited the cities of Rhapsody, Fragrance, Hyacinth, Massicot, and Sorghum, with stops at Verdant and Chrysanthemum yet to come. In a month, she would be back home in Vermilion, having seen more of her realm over the past several weeks than she had in her entire life.\n\nShe caught a commotion in the crowd out of the corner of her eye, and turned just in time to see a kirin mare shove her way to the front of the crowd and her horn light up. Before anykirin could react, she pulled a revolver from the inside of her coat and fired all six shots directly at the palanquin. Rain Shine felt something slice across her shoulder and some invisible force kick her in the back as the palanquin toppled over, her servants carrying it dropping it in shock and fear, their Matriarch falling into the dirt as screams of terror rang out throughout the crowd. Groaning, Rain Shine lifted herself up from the dirt, looking to her left just in time to see the would-be assassin end up skewered on the spear of one of her guards.\n\n"Matriarch! Concord's flames, you're hurt!" Her servants and guards swarmed around her, quickly righting the palanquin and all but dumping her into it as her procession beat a hasty retreat from the town. The awed worshippers that had lined the streets were gone, and Persimon found itself suffocating in eerie stillness, save for the distant wails that somekirin had killed the Matriarch. One of Rain Shine's servants tore up their own robes to bandage the Matriarch, and Rain Shine realized she'd been shot. One shot had barely grazed by her shoulder, missing her head only for the angle she had held her neck at when the assassin fired, and another had smashed into the armor on her back, breaking loose two of the scales and leaving bloody sores in their place. The injuries hurt, but the symbolism was far more painful to her. She was supposed to embody Concord's divinity in the mortal realm. And some kirin had tried to kill her. While scales would grow back and cuts would heal, she had been attacked, assaulted, and wounded. Those injuries would never go away; they had shattered her reputation and legitimacy as Concord's divine avatar on earth.\n\nForlorn, Rain Shine ordered the procession to take her back to Vermilion. It was too dangerous to continue with the tour. Who knew how many other assassins were lying in wait in the west, ready to strike down the Matriarch if given the chance?"

kirin_pirate.1.t:0 "Pirate Raids from the Auburn Isle" 
kirin_pirate.1.d:0 "Autumn Blaze skimmed through the last report attached to the Imperial Census of the southern coastline before setting it aside. So far, she had read fifteen reports from Imperial administrators who had visited the coastal towns to take stock of the situation along Kiria's coastline, and each of them had been largely the same. Punctuating all the droll figures on population numbers, tax determination, and analysis of the local economy were reports of pirate attacks and raids. Autumn knew that there was a strong pirate presence in Auburn Isles, where an entire armada of pirates operated out of the port of Nacre, and she had been aware that they somewhat regularly raided the coastline for goods and bodies to press into service. But the caveat that bothered her in each of these reports was that they were apparently getting more frequent and destructive. What had once become an irregular occurrence for these towns was beginning to happen with a concerning amount of regularity. Pirate attacks were surely increasing and growing more organized, and the red sails of the pirate junks had even been spotted prowling off the coast of the Great Mellifluve river, searching for ships to prey on carrying goods out of the kirin heartlands. It was a bold move given the number of ships that ventured across those waters, and Autumn didn't like that one bit.\n\nFor now, the pirates were still only raiding small fishing villages and coastal towns, and staying clear of more populated and patrolled locales. But it couldn't be denied that the increasing occurrence of attacks and the wider range the pirates seemed to be patrolling was a bad omen for things to come. If the pirates were growing bolder, then it would only be a matter of time before they started attacking more lucrative targets. And with the realm still struggling to pull itself out of the stagnation and decay of The Silence, the last thing it needed right now was a series of pirate attacks destabilizing the coastal economy. Something would have to be done to stop the pirates before this problem spiraled out of control, or the consequences would be severe."

As the Realm of Kiria undergoes its breakneck modernisation following the ending of The Silence, the pirates of Auburn Isle have lashed out with a desperate frenzy of raids and attacks, seeming as if they seek to delay the inevitable by seizing as much loot as they possibly can. As the problem spirals out of control, it is becoming increasingly clear that the waters around the Realm of Kiria are dangerous, and any ships sailing around Eastern Zebrica should be well-prepared to fend off attacks until the situation is brought under control."

It was swiftly set upon by the pirates, and the captain of the submarine surrendered the vessel, where it was towed back to Nacre with the crew in chains. After pressuring the crew into repairing their submarine, the pirates have begun to employ it in surprise attacks on merchant ships and convoys that wander too close to Auburn Isle with terrifying effectiveness.

It was just her in her little boat today; her father was ill at home, recovering from a bout of the flu, so she had had to venture out alone that morning. Now, with the red sails of the pirate junks baring down on her, she wished she at least had the protection of the rest of the fishing fleet with her. Even if she unfurled her square sail and rowed as hard as she could, she knew there was no way she'd be able to outrun the pirates. Instead, she could only brace herself for the inevitable.\n\nAs the fleet approached, one ship broke off from the others to intercept her dinghy while the rest continued on in the direction of Teak. Jade could only gulp and look up at the hulking ship soon looming over her, its rails lined with hardened kirin grinning down at her. The pirates tossed a rope ladder over the side, and one wolf-whistled down at her. "Why don't you make this easy for us, little lady?" one of the pirates shouted down to her. "Save us the effort so we can catch up with the rest of the fleet."\n\nFrightened beyond belief, yet still harboring a spark of defiance, Jade grabbed her wooden harpoon in her magic and pointed it up at the pirates. "Leave me alone!" she shouted back. "P-Please! I-I don't have anything to give you!"\n\n"Is that so?" Before Jade could react, two pirates jumped down onto her boat, rocking it back and forth and nearly tossing her overboard. She jabbed at one with her harpoon, but the pirate deflected it with her sword while the other one clubbed Jade on the back of her head. The mare groaned and fell to the floor, her vision swimming as the two pirates loomed over her.\n\n"She's a pretty one, isn't she?" the stallion remarked to his companion. "I think I'll take her back to Nacre and make her my wife." Then he knelt down in front of Jade and lifted her chin with his hoof, blowing a little kiss at her when she managed to focus on his face. "Don't worry, you poor thing. I'll take good care of you back home. I'll shower you with treasures and we'll make sweet love under the moonlight. You won't want for anything ever again. How does that sound?"\n\nJade had no response. With a final terrified sigh, her eyes rolled back into her skull, and darkness overcame her."

The fog was so thick that the electric lantern burning at the bow of the ship was little more than a yellow halo somewhere ahead of him. The mood of the crew on the ship was tense as the engines hummed and thrummed, churning the unsettled water and pushing the ship onwards through the haze.\n\nHe turned to his navigator, who scratched at the fringes of his lower mane as he pored over the maps in the bridge. "Are we past Auburn Isle yet?" he asked, trying to trace the progress his navigator had plotted on the map. "There's rocky shoals and some coral around it that I'd rather we not crash into. Not to mention the pirates. If that storm hadn't turned us closer inland, I would have preferred giving that island a wide berth. Sycee doesn't pay us well enough to tangle with pirates."\n\nn"We have marines to protect us, and they have modern guns," the navigator retorted. "At any rate, we should be almost around Auburn, if our instruments are correct. From there it should be smooth sailing to Verdant."\n\nCandlelight opened his mouth to reply, but the ship shook as something slammed into it from the side with a metallic clang. Shouts rang out through the fog, and Candlelight ran to the bridge windows to see kirin in salt-stained and mismatched garb jumping off of wooden vessels onto the deck from either side of his ship. Black powder weapons let out sharp reports with a flash of sparks, and as the first of the marines on deck fell in the ambush, the pirates snatched up their modern weapons and began firing on the rest. And every second, more and more jumped onto his ship...\n\nCandlelight's face paled. He knew the battle was over before it even began. The pirates must have followed his lantern through the fog, and with the wind on their side, they had glided in without making a sound. The ship and all of its goods were theirs, and he wasn't about to die to protect the Sycee Trading House's product.\n\nHe wasted no time in formally surrendering when the pirates stormed the bridge."

In the face of the mounting economic and political toll of the pirates' uncontested control of the East Kirin Sea, the newly-reorganised Kirin government at Vermilion risks domestic instability and foreign scrutiny for their continued inaction in addressing the pirate menace, having effectively surrendered control of their coastal waters and shipping lanes to the pirates of Auburn Isle."

kirin_pirate.7.d:0 "Pond Frog looked up from the flooded rows of the rice paddie as the hulking junks sailed into the mouth of the Great Mellifluve, using the southerly winds to force themselves about two hundred meters upstream before lowering their red sails and dropping anchor. The ships arrived in three ranks, with the first and third lines turning their bows toward the shore and arranging their broadsides up and down the river, and the second rank oriented north and south with their guns trained on the shore. There they sat and there they waited, their red hulls practically glowing like fire in the morning sun as the blockade settled in.\n\nIt did not take them long to ensnare their first victim. A merchant ship sailing down the river was forced to turn to port and drop its anchor to pivot before reaching the blockade, but before it could open its sails and catch the wind to sail upriver again, longships launched from the junks rowed out to it and swarmed the ship. Within minutes, the crew was subdued and the captured ship was sailed into the protective embrace of the pirate blockade, where it was anchored until a treasure fleet could be amassed and sailed away to safety. As the hours rolled on, ship after ship fell into the same trap, with even ships sailing up the river from the South Kirin Sea to Verdant falling victim. By the end of the day, and by the time Pond Frog finally was ready to go home, the pirates had amassed seventeen ships in their protective bubble.\n\nThe farmer simply shook his head as he packed up his tools and waded out of the flooded fields. At least the pirates had more valuable prizes to keep them entertained than rice. To the merchants and their ships, the appearance of a blockade in the Great Mellifluve had likely been a horrific surprise. But to Pond Frog, it was nothing new. Kiria had been a broken and defunct country when his father was a foal, and his father's father before him. Nothing had changed, despite all that talk coming out of the capital.

kirin_crisis.1.d:0 "The horrific reek of sewage and pollution struck Autumn Blaze like a slap to the face as soon as she stepped out of the train car in Verdant's train station. Even a few hundred meters from the shoreline, the Great Mellifluve stank like rotting fish and foul eggs. Cinder Glow gagged as she followed Autumn off the train, and she quickly pinched her nose shut with a cleft hoof. "That smells horrific!" she shouted over the hiss and whistle of the steam engine behind them. "What crawled up Concord's divine rear and died?"\n\n"This is terrible," Autumn said, wincing as she made her way from the train station toward the river. Sickly kirin dotted the streets, leaning against the walls and grimacing, while others briskly trotted to where they needed to go, noses covered with cloth masks to keep out the stench as best they could. When the delegation from Vermilion arrived on the shores of the Great Mellifluve, they found them covered with dead and rotting fish, the once blue waters of Kiria's lifeblood a sickly green and black. To their horror, they saw a few kirin on one of the island communes of Verdant dropping buckets into the poisoned water to bring back to their homes. It was little wonder Verdant was so full of sickly and starving kirin.\n\n"The factories upstream are causing this," Autumn said. "I read reports that they were dumping industrial waste into the Mellifluve, but I didn't imagine it was this bad!"\n\n"It's not just the factories either," Cinder remarked. "Farmers are dumping fertilizer into their fields, and it's all running off with the rain. And the cities are exploding in population. They don't have anything near robust enough sewage systems to deal with all the waste. All of that is getting dumped into the river, and it all flows downstream to Verdant."\n\n"We have to step in and do something to stop this," Autumn decided.

Clams are clean and tasty, the pollution can't get in their shells!"\n\nShe finally reached the mouth of the canal and turned left, making her way toward the Coruscating Lagoon, Verdant's largest water market. Hundreds of little boats bobbed in the green and black waters filled with countless peddlers like her selling their wares to kirin that sailed past. But today, the calls and cries of peddlers were silent, and hundreds of kirin watched from their boats and the shorelines as a tall stallion in fiery red and orange robes stood on a barge in the middle of the lagoon. Curious, Littlescale pushed her dinghy closer to hear what he was saying.\n\n"Verdant has been abandoned by Vermilion!" the stallion said, and Littlescale recognized him as a priest of the Rising Fire sect that dominated Verdant. "We have been left to rot in filth and sewage. We languish in the waste that they pollute the lifeblood of Kiria with! Our children and elderly are stick and starving, and the air hangs heavy with the stench of death and disease! Our beautiful waters, once as blue as sapphires, are now black with acid! Who is to blame for this? It is the greed of the northerners and the vanity of the east! Vermilion drags us into a new age, an age of marvelous modernization, or so they say. But look at what their industrial revolution has done to our home! We suffer and die because they chase greed and power. Greed and power! The Plenum in Vermilion has abandoned Concord's teachings. They have forgotten Her tenets! And worse yet, they have poisoned the mind of our beloved Matriarch, forcing her to chase progress and growth over a harmonious relationship with nature. It must end!"\n\nThe crowd murmured its approval, but the priest was not finished yet. "If we allow the greed and corruption in Vermilion to fester, then Kiria will be ruined in a few short decades. They must be stopped, and the corrupt hedonism of the so-called priests and mystics of The Way of Fire must be put to an end. So I ask you, kirin of Verdant, will you stand with me and my brothers and sisters as we take back what is ours? Will you stand with us as we save our home from pestilence and plague?

But as she prepared to sequester herself away in the morning room, she turned first to a page for her morning briefing of the day's events.\n\n"It is bad news, your Divinity," the page said, bowing his head low. "Last night's storm was the dying gasp of the terrible typhoon that struck our east coast two days ago. We spent all day yesterday assessing the damage, there was simply so much destruction wrought along the coastline. The heavy rainfall and strong winds caused massive flooding, landslides, and widespread damage to buildings, farms, and infrastructure. We don't know how many kirin lost their lives, but we expect it to be at least five hundred.

If there is any silver lining to be found in this catastrophe, it is that their funding and involvement will help to modernize the coastline now that the land has been cleared by the storm."\n\n"The Way of Fire and the diaspora rarely get along," Rain Shine observed.

Partisan fighting forced the bill to drag on and on, and while the Secretariat argued amongst themselves, the kirin living on the coast suffered in wait for help that was taking too long to arrive. It had taken Autumn bringing Rain Shine into the Secretariat and asking her to issue decrees to arbitrate on the relief plan that had finally started to get things moving, but it had been too little, too late. It seemed like every kirin in the capital soon started blaming the Plenum for the failure to aid with disaster relief, from the most conservative Way of Fire mystics to the most ardently supremacist diaspora returnees. Even farmers and laborers started to speak out against the government, and it became increasingly clear to all the members of the Plenum that the kirin of the Realm blamed them for the suffering along the coast.\n\nBut that was not the end of the bad news. As Autumn looked through her day's reports, she found a report from an aide traveling the region and detailing the situation. In lieu of proper governmental support, the Rising Fire religious sect had taken it upon themselves to step in and provide aid to those hit hardest by the typhoon. While this was good for the kirin along the coast, it foretold disaster for the authority of Vermilion over the Realm, as the Rising Fire grew in strength and support in the east to bolster their stronghold over the realm in the west.

Two hundred meters away, the train that had been carrying passengers from Sorghum to Chrysanthemum lay on its side, its windows broken and its frame crumpled. Even this long after the attack, one of the wheels on the caboose still turned lazily beneath the afternoon sun, the momentum from the crash still whiling away on well-greased bearings.\n\nAffairs quickly located the constable and pulled him aside to get the details right from the kirin who likely knew best what was going on. "What happened here?" he asked him. "Those rails were blasted apart. Was it bandits?"\n\n"Absolutely," the constable said. "Their bodies were littered all around the train. They got enough gunpowder to blow the rails and derail the train, but they only had swords and scythes, while the guards had rifles. They paid dearly for what they stole."\n\n"And what did they steal?" Affairs asked.\n\n"Chrysanthemum was expecting Lady Zenith Bloom to arrive today," the constable said. "The NAKP had dispatched her to the city to establish a western branch of her party in Chrysanthemum, or so we had been told. She brought a lot of gold bullion with her, too. Somehow the bandits found that out and laid their ambush. Lots of kirin died here today." The constable shrugged. "There were no survivors from the train. We haven't found Lady Zenith's body yet, but we assume she's among the dead somewhere. At any rate, this seems like the last hurrah for those bandits. Not likely to be many of them left after they tried rushing riflekirin with swords."\n\nAffairs nodded and thanked the constable for his time before he left. He could only look at the carnage around the rails and shake his head. Was this one final act of glory for the bandits of the west? Kiria was changing so quickly and so drastically that even bandits had to know their time was coming soon. Perhaps it was one final statement from a dying breed of kirin, one final chapter to their story for the world to remember them by.

"Peace-and-Plenty is in a famine? How could that be? When Fickle Current proposed implementing new farming techniques there, he said they would be limited to the Sorghum Foundry's private farmland. How can the entire breadbasket of Kiria be starving?"\n\n"Sorghum owns more farmland in the area than you think," the messenger explained. "They officially only own 300 acres of farmland around the city limits, but they forced several thousand more acres of farmland owned by independent farmers into sharecropping after they helped to create and then bought up titles to the land in the name of the Matriarch with the help of the NAKP. The farmers own and work the land at Sorghum's leisure, and earlier this season Sorghum forced them all to adopt new planting practices if they wanted to keep the land."\n\nAutumn Blaze was shocked and taken aback. Of course, Current had neglected to mention that little detail when he proposed his new farming techniques. And now that they had all failed, they were taking down Peace-and-Plenty with them. How was Kiria supposed to feed its people if its most fertile and prosperous farmland had failed? If Peace-and-Plenty was struck by famine, Autumn could scarcely imagine how terrible things were about to become for the rest of Kiria. "I... thank you, messenger," she said, staring off into space above the mare's head. "Leave the notes and you are dismissed. I will... I'll try to find some way to deal with this all... somehow..."

kirin_crisis.7.d:0 "There have been bread riots in Fragrance! says the messenger who had arrived in Autumn's office in the Reform Bureau. Fuck, says Autumn. Fickle Current warned me about this. What happened? because the surrounding countryside couldn't support Fragrance with enough food, they ended up having to buy food from other parts of the country and import it to the city, says the messenger. the price of basic staple foods became more expensive as a result. what's worse is that the city council decided not to impose price restrictions on food, so the prices just kept rising. out of desperation, somekirin beat a well-loved elderly bard to death to steal his food. the guards caught and executed a youth they said was responsible, but people thought that she was just a scapegoat. after the public execution, a mob stormed and looted the grain/rice warehouses and rioting broke out across the city, with fighting between the returnee communities and the dispossessed migrant worker underclass. things have quieted down a bit now but the government needs to intervene in Fragrance to implement price controls on food to restore law and order to the city."

Rain Shine tells Autumn that Fickle Current had approached her earlier in the day seeking her approval to declare a ban on the movement known as the 'Incendiaries'. loosely affiliated to the Rising Fire, the Incendiaries are fiercely and militantly opposed to the land requisitions by the central government. They have a substantial power base amongst the agrarian population of peasant farmers, many of whom are instinctively opposed to the government's expropriation of their land for factories, urban development, and other development. the radical ideas espoused by the Incendiaries include land justice, collective ownership of land, anti-modernity, pro-tradition and Way of Fire/Rising Fire (or at least their interpretations thereof). Akin to the Levellers/Diggers in England. the Incendiaries have been known to attack infrastructure and building projects they oppose. the scaffolding for a dam downriver of Chrysanthemum was attacked by several nirik and destroyed; a newly-built grain silo was burnt down the night before grain quotas were due from farmers in the settlement of Cornsilk; there have been several fires that have devastated the farmlands of peace-and-plenty that originated from nirik transformations, in Apricot Glen, a delegation of NAKP-employed land surveyors in their automobile were run off the road by a mob of farmers, dragged out, and beaten. obviously these Incendiaries have a point, says Rain Shine. I am somewhat sympathetic to their cause. But they seem misguided in their militancy, and my advisors tell me they might be being incited by the Rising Fire and other subversive elements. I want you to pay special attention to the Incendiaries' Movement. Once you have made a decision, come talk to me again, and we'll decide what I should say in my decree addressing the incendiaries."

But if we assert our authority by forcing the Sycee Trading House to curb the proliferation of their scrip, then we risk retarding the economic growth of the nothern powerhouses that are driving Kiria's modernisation. pride or pragmatism? in the case of the former, the Reform Bureau will take action to override the inevitable protests of the Morning Secretariat, asserting the dominance of the executive over the legislature."

As part of its beliefs, all kirin owe complete devotion and reverence to the Matriarch Superior, their divine leader who unites with Concord's godly divinity upon her ascension, and whose will is interpreted and executed by a robust caste of priests and mystics scattered throughout the Realm. Defiance of the Matriarch's decrees is considered blasphemy against Concord Herself, and so the Matriarchs of Kiria rule with absolute theocratic authority.

KIR_GREAT_LEAP_DECISION_DESCRIPTION_2:0 "the §YRealm of Kiria§! into an industrialized nation by the end of Year 1011. The Plan is the cornerstone of the §YAll-Kiria Plenum for National Revival§!, an assemblage of Kiria's best and brightest summoned to Vermilion, at the behest of Matriarch Superior §YRain Shine§!, to guide the Realm out of the Silence and into the modern era. Supported by Kiria's friends in Equestria, funded by the wealth of the returning Kirin diaspora, fueled by the resurgent flames of Kirin patriotism and driven by the indomitable will of the Kirin people, Premier Autumn Blaze believes that the Plan can succeed — but only if the Plenum learns to work together, in spite of their ideological differences, towards their shared goal of a strong, independent, and modernized Kiria."

### Diary Entries ###
KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_1:0 "I left Vermilion a few weeks ago to go visit the new steelworks that have been erected in Fragrance and Rhapsody, argued for and funded in large part by §YFickle Current§! and his like-minded business partners. I've traveled a little bit around the Realm as part of the job, and even a little bit before that when §YThe Silence§! still had our people locked in its grasp, but I've never been this far north. I thought all of our realm was like Vermilion or Massicot, either withering cities dwindling as they decayed, or small villages full of kirin trying to scratch out simple lives with no support or assistance from the government. But Fragrance and Rhapsody are nothing like that! They are still splendid cities, places that tried so very hard to resist the economic and societal collapses of The Silence, and managed to save some of our culture and way of life from before The Silence brought everything to a standstill. I don't know how better I could describe it. The kirin in these cities still have life and color in them, a sense of optimism that tomorrow is going to be a §Ybetter day.§! That's something I share with them, and it made me oh so happy to see it during my travels.\n\nOh, shoot, I'm getting off topic. Or am I? I don't know. Anyway, the §Ysteelworks§! that Fickle Current's clique funded are an amazing sight to behold. These aren't just workshops where blacksmiths forge steel and work their craft; this is something else entirely, a §Ymodern revolution§! that was smothered in Kiria a century ago, but was refined and perfected by the griffons of Griffonia and the ponies of Equus. These are entire factories filled with heavy machinery powered by electricity (another invention from over the seas; it makes me realize just how small my world was growing up in The Silence!) and guided along by workers who pull levers, hit buttons and somehow wrangle these machines into doing all the work for them. And the results can't even be compared to the work of smithy workshops and guilds; these factories can produce §Yin a day§! what an entire guild of talented blacksmiths can produce in a year! Sure, it loses some of that personal touch, but when we're trying to drag our entire nation into the modern era after a century of sitting on our hooves, this industrialization is practically a blessing sent by §YConcord§! herself. Current and his friends might be a little too cynical and greedy for my tastes, but the inventions they're bringing in from overseas, and the capital they're investing in setting up our industry, more than makes up for it. I can only hope that some of the fruits of their labor can make its way down to the ponies working in the steel mills; those I talked to said they worked §Yten or twelve hours a day§! in the scorching heat, with only a few breaks throughout the day. But it pays better than farming (so I've been told), and besides, we kirin like the heat anyway. It's a rough start for many of these workers, but I feel that given enough time and hardwork, this will all pay off for them like it will for the rest of us. We just have to believe in the future we're all building §Ytogether.§!\n\nI believe in that future, and in the Matriarch Superior, and in Concord's blessings. To some extent, I believe in Fickle Current and his compatriots too. We just have to work together to make the best use of the blessings Kiria has been given, and we can shape our future into anything we want it to be. And I'm going to do §Yeverything§! I can to help make it happen!"

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_2:0 "Reform, reform, reform! I don't know how many times I had to say that word during the first meeting of §YThe Reform Bureau§! (oh darn I just did it again!), but today was a very busy day! Since the Matriarch Superior made me the premier of the §YPlenum§! (I still don't know why she trusts me with that much responsibility), I was automatically made the head of the Reform Bureau, which is just basically a fancy way of saying I have to be responsible for getting all the influential delegates from the Plenum into one place where we can discuss the specifics of how we want to enact things that get passed on the debate floor. We are, essentially, the §Ycentral government§! of Kiria, and we act with a limited amount of imperial mandate that Rain Shine blessed us with. That's a lot of responsibility for a young mare from Massicot to handle, but I'll do my best to save the Realm and not let the Matriarch down!\n\nUnfortunately, trying to get everykirin to work together is like herding cats, and I've never had a pet cat before, let alone two or three or four, so I'm a little short on experience. §YFickle Current§! brought in a lot of his buddies from overseas, and though the capitalists are providing a lot of the capital and ideas we need to get this whole modernization thing moving, I feel like I have to stop them from reshaping Kiria to §Ysuit their interests§! over those of the common kirin. At least I have somewhat of an ally in that in §YPriestess Winter Frost§!, who is wary about how rapid modernization will alter the social fabric of the kirin species, but I often feel like she goes a little too far. If you try to suggest anything that changes the way kirin society functioned during The Silence, she usually §Ypushes back hard on it§!, afraid of how any hint of modernization could possibly weaken the influence of §YThe Way of Fire§! in our culture. I had to end up playing middlemare between the two and finding a §Ycompromise that helps out everykirin§!, but I don't know how much longer I can keep that up if Winter and Fickle don't get on the same page. It's exhausting! Oh, how I wish I had Applejack and Fluttershy here to help show us how to follow §Ythe Equestrian model of Harmony...§!\n\nBut I'm not going to give up, not at all. Even if it is exhausting and draining, I'm going to keep going back into the Bureau and doing my best to move things along for the good of all the Realm. Hopefully, as we keep working together, we'll be able to get everykirin to have fair and honest debates about how we're going to modernize the country. We all have a common goal, afterall. It falls on us to figure out how to get to it. I'm confident we'll find a way to make that happen!"

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_3:0 "I do not think that I am a good Premier.\n\nOh, how do I even begin? Today's assembly at the court was a complete and total disaster. In the midst of our bickering, a procession of kirin following the religious doctrine they call §YThe Rising Fire§! entered the court, led by a mare who calls herself Rising Sun, and asked to join in on the Plenum. I wanted to let them join, as every kirin should have a voice in determining §Ythe future of the Realm§!, but I let myself be bowled over by §YWinter Frost§! and §YFickle Current§!, who immediately opposed Rising Sun and her followers from joining in. Winter despises The Rising Fire, calling it and its followers §Yheretics§!, and I'm pretty sure she'd toss them all into the sea if she could. Current and his pals don't like the ideas of a §Ycommunalist society§!, because they feel it's a threat to the industry and capitalism they're trying to set up in the Realm. And me? I don't know what happened in court. I felt like I wasn't sure if letting Rising Sun and her followers join the Plenum was the right idea. §YEquestria§! once had a problem with ponies who had a similar mindset to Rising Sun and her sect, and it caused so much misery up there. Maybe I just didn't want the same thing to happen here in the Realm.\n\nBut Rising Sun and her followers are gone now. When I refused to welcome them to the Plenum, they were §Ychased out of the city§! by supporters of Fickle and Winter... and even some of my supporters as well. Instead of talking things out with Rising Sun, we refused to listen to what she had to say and used force to make her go away. And you know what scares me the most? Winter and Current were §Ymore than happy§! to use force to get what they wanted. I'm starting to think that not every debate and problem we're going to encounter at the Plenum can be solved with §Ywords and compromise§!. Force of will and personality (and, I hope, only those two kinds of force) will be what drags this Plenum across the finish line. I don't know if I have the mettle to stand up to Current and Frost when it counts. If I did, maybe I would have made sure that Rising Sun and her delegation had a seat at the Plenum to contribute ideas for the revitalization of our nation.\n\n§YThings are going badly§!, I feel, and this whole ordeal is turning out to be less fulfilling and uplifting than I thought it was going to be when I agreed to be the Matriarch's premier at the start of it all. But it's too late to back out of this now or feel sorry for myself. I have to push on and keep doing my job, no matter what it takes. §YAll of Kiria depends on it.§!"

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_2_entry_1:0 "Praise be to Concord that in Her divine wisdom, She has seen fit to end The Silence that has blanketed our realm for too long. The kirin people have had §Yone hundred years§! to repent and reflect on the sins of modernization that nearly undid all the hard work of The Way of Fire in unifying our scattered and quarrelsome race centuries ago, and I feel that our society and culture has learned a great deal from the experience. Concord imparted Her will to punish Her errant children through §YMatriarch Noctilucent Charm§!, and now She has decided to forgive us through §YMatriarch Rain Shine§!. Now the only question is this: did we learn our lesson the first time?\n\nDuring Matriarch Charm's reign, §Yunchecked and unfettered modernization§! nearly collapsed our society, as the hedonism of modern conveniences turned our society away from the simple truths of The Way of Fire. We, our parents, our grandparents, and even our great grandparents have atoned for these mistakes. As proudly supportive of tradition as I am, and naturally wary of any change that could undermine Concord's divine authority in our lives, I nevertheless believe that we can safely bring the Realm out of The Silence and into the modern era through careful reflection and consideration of how our choices align with Concord's will. We cannot be willing to blindly turn our faith from our Matriarch to enlightenment and luxury, for then we lose sight of Concord's vision. Foreigners like Fickle Current and his capitalists have been born and raised without Concord's guidance in their lives; they are no followers of The Way of Fire, and they should not be allowed to dictate the future of kirin society. But their money and innovations can serve Kiria in Her vision all the same. One example is the §Yexpansion of roads§! that many of my fellow priests and mystics have volunteered to organize and lead. All across the Realm, my fellow spiritual leaders are recruiting peasants from the fields to repair and renew the roads linking the Realm together, roads that have long fallen into disrepair and disuse throughout The Silence. It is important work that needs to be done, and this modernization will allow us to once again §Yreassert Concord's will§! across the Realm. It is a truly noble project, and just one of many ways we can use the tools of the modern time to reinforce our tradition and our heritage.\n\nBut such a venture also comes with its own risks. The disconnectedness of The Silence was a test placed by Concord to measure our devotion and reward our faith in Her. But now that we are reconnecting the realm, it is clear that some have failed the test. §YHotbeds of heresy§! have sprung up in the west, even in cities such as Verdant and Chrysanthemum, where the mystics and their followers have turned away from The Way of Fire to adopt their own set of heretical beliefs. Connecting Vermilion to these cities is not a one way street; just as they allow the Matriarch to reassert her authority over the west, they allow the heretics to spread their lies and falsehoods further into the east. Such heresy is §Yunacceptable§!, and I will do everything in my power to stamp it out before its corruption can ensnare Vermilion. Such is Concord's will, and as one of Her priestesses, I am Her instrument. I will not fail my Goddess, nor will I fail my Matriarch. I will be the voice of tradition and heritage that Kiria needs me to be, for the good of the Realm."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_2_entry_2:0 "Concord, my Goddess, if You have seen fit to challenge me in such a way, please lend me the strength to pass Your test.\n\n§YThe Way of Fire§! is beset by heretics and traitors at every corner. Today, Fickle Current and his cronies orchestrated a takeover of the government through paper and honeyed words. They stole the divine authority that Concord blesses our Matriarchs with for themselves, turning the Morning Secretariat into the central governing body of the Realm, and removing Matriarch Rain Shine's ability to rule by imperial decree, as has been done in the Realm for centuries. All of this was done under the pretense of codifying laws and political power, but it is nothing more than attempting to put the rule of mortals over the §Ydivine will of Concord§!. The Realm is slowly losing the religious foundations that made it so wonderful and stable, and nokirin outside of my followers seems to care. We were a squabbling mess of petty tribes and villages before The Way of Fire saved us all. What is to stop us from returning to this dreadful way of life should we forget the importance of its five tenets?\n\nIn time, I believe the kirin of Kiria will see the truth of what Fickle Current and his allies are: corrupt and godless businesskirin §Yonly in it for themselves§!. The people of Kiria will stop them from turning the Realm into their plaything, of that, I am sure. But what I am less sure about is the subversive activities of the heretic, §YRising Sun§!. From the moment she entered Vermilion, I knew that she had but one goal on her mind: to destroy The Way of Fire and replace it with her own heresy that she calls §YThe Rising Fire§!. She and her misguided followers believe that their individual communities share a deeper connection with Concord than our divine Matriarch, that the word of the Goddess Herself can be deciphered by the common kirin instead of needing the interpretation of educated and trained priests and scholars. Though she did her best to hide it today, I am sure that this harlot sees the weakening of our Matriarch's authority as a blessing, a way to weaken the righteous grasp of The Way of Fire over the Realm, allowing her to spread her heresy far and wide.\n\nWhat concerns me most about Rising Fire is her §Ycunning§!. Any sensible and respectable kirin would immediately denounce heresy against Concord, but Rising Sun has managed to trick countless thousands of kirin into following her beliefs. Her mind is sharp, her tongue quick, and her eyes seem to see everything at once. I have seen her work at the Plenum ever since our §Yhopeless Premier§! mistakenly saw fit to allow her delegation to participate. She is shrewd and cunning, and plays off of the other delegations to get what she wants. She pretends to support The Way of Fire and the Matriarch when it is convenient, and abandons them when it is not. All the while, her supporters campaign in the city, ever-deepening their entrenchment in the capital of the Realm. Were that I had the power of the first Matriarch, §YIridescent Dawn§!, who could subdue foes with her words and whose talents of theology and rhetoric were unmatched in all the Realm, who could talk a nirik out of their rage when all other methods fail. Were that I could use her skills to dismantle this heretic sect on the Plenum floor, to make the rest of the Realm see how close we are to falling to heresy. Every second that we entertain The Rising Fire is another moment it has to strengthen its position. Something has to be done sooner rather than later. Otherwise, §Yall is lost§!."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_2_entry_3:0 "Winter Frost reflects on the day's events: she had returned to her monastery home in the mountains of the Vermilion Basin. in the village near the monastery, she gave Concord's blessing to a group of kirin youths who had heeded Vermilion's call for aspirant Vanguards, and were going to be headed to the distant Noctilucent Forest for intensive and brutal training. She had watched these youths grow up; strong, clumsy, but kind (name here), lithe and cunning (name here), brother and sister (names here) etc. Humanise Winter Frost; she is a maternal figure to these hopeful kirin youth looking to serve the country. undertone of religious fundamentalism; before seeing them on their way she asks them, for whose glory do you fight for? Concord's, of course - not the merchants of Fragrance, nor the squabbling and divided Plenum, nor the factional Morning Secretariat, and certainly not the heretics of the Rising Fire. she had given them each a hoofwritten anthology of the Way of Fire's most important scriptures. she really cares for them, and they will die fighting for the ideals she has instilled into them since childhood (don't state the latter part of this outright though - we don't want her to come off as cynical/manipulative/insincere in her faith and in her affection for the youths)."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_3_entry_1:0 "It is still surreal to me that I am now living in my ancestral homeland. I may have been born in Skyfall and spent the better part of 54 years of my life in Griffonia and Equus, but §YKiria§! has always tugged at my heart from afar. I grew up hearing stories from my grandfather about the country he left behind and the family he had to say goodbye to, and though those memories are tinted rose with the passage of time, the stories he told were not happy ones. §YThe Silence§! destroyed his successful trading company and uprooted so many kirin like him, kirin who fled across the world to find a better life than the life the Matriarch and The Way of Fire forced upon them at home. Those who did not flee were left destitute in the apocalyptic aftermath of economic suicide; who knows how many relatives my family once had who have faded into §Yobscurity and squalor§! because they could not flee to Griffonia like my grandfather did? I have thought many times about reconnecting with distant relatives who spent their entire lives living in The Silence instead of abroad, but always decided against it. What family I have lived in Griffonia with me, not in Kiria, and those that lived here would only be asking for handouts from a §Ysuccessful businesskirin§! who made his fortune in more opportune places.\n\nBut now that I have returned to Kiria, there is much work to be done. Foremost among these tasks is bringing back §Ythe diaspora§! and making sure that their voices will be heard in the reconstruction of our nation. Kiria is hopeless without her foals educated abroad, foals who have gone on to be successful capitalists, industrialists, scientists, inventors, entrepreneurs, and more in nations that appreciated their talents. From the moment I arrived in Kiria, I have spent as much time as I can afford trying to reach out to the diaspora and §Ybring them home§!, and my labors have thus far borne many fruits. Just last night, I concluded a party in Fragrance where I brushed shoulders and exchanged words and promises with many of these lost sons and daughters of Kiria. In exchange for their financial support, I promised them §Ylucrative contracts§! and business deals in the resurgent Realm to make their time and money worth the investment. I have indebted myself under a mountain of favors, but like any good businesscreature, I am good at finding ways to get others to foot the bill. §YMatriarch Rain Shine§! and the rest of the government will make excellent patrons to exchange these favors with; after all, everything I do for the Realm benefits them greatly.\n\nSoon, my vision, and the vision of the Realm's lost foals, will emerge triumphant over this period of reform. We are all organized, disciplined, connected, and funded in a way that no other kirin in this Realm is, even our Matriarch. We will be Kiria's saviors, and as such, we will make sure that we are amply rewarded... §Ywhen the time comes§!."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_3_entry_2:0 "It pleases me to see the progress we've made in modernizing the Realm when we have the right kirin to guide the process. Our latest victory was the §YCharter of Rights§! that I saw passed through the Plenum. Kiria's legal system was a mess, but what is to be expected of a §Yhopeless theocracy§!? The nation was held together by hundreds if not thousands of vague religious rulings and conflicting interpretations of Concord's divine will. This made it very hard for any enterprising kirin to maneuver in the system; what one mystic thinks is acceptable may be completely unacceptable to another, and in disputes such as these, mystics and priests immediately defer to their higher authority without question. In most cases, that ends up being the §YMatriarch Superior§!, giving her ultimate decision making authority over the Realm. But now with the Charter of Rights passed, §YThe Way of Fire§! no longer holds such absolute authority over the land. The Charter is a single codified document free of confusing and vague religious statutes that explicitly lays down the word of law. Of course, I made sure that such a Charter was not §Ytoo restricting§! in its legalese. There is space to maneuver, semantics to exploit, and technicalities to find, all perfectly legal within the law for a kirin clever enough to find them. I even managed to score crucial victories for §Yprivate property rights§!, freeing much of a kirin's wealth and assets from mandatory tithes to The Way of Fire, a useless tax that would cripple investments and incentives for any business trying to operate in the Realm. This has been, undeniably, a win for §Ycapitalism§!, and the future of Kiria is looking bright.\n\nBut there is always room to improve. A good businesskirin will not settle for reducing their taxes to 20%, when they could instead be 15% with enough pushing and prodding. Despite the influence I wielded over the Charter, §YPremier Autumn Blaze§! and her allies still managed to include provisions for labor rights and civic freedoms. These are the sort of things that are good to have in a developed nation where they can be afforded, but Kiria is not a developed nation. We are poor and agrarian, and these reforms §Ystand in the way of progress§!. But at any rate, I only see them as temporary obstacles. Autumn is hopelessly outclassed by her job, and I cannot help but feel sorry for the poor mare. She is young and clueless to how the world works; she only earned the position because Matriarch Rain Shine feels §Yindebted§! to her for some reason. I fully expect her support to evaporate as she continues to blunder her way through the Plenum, and when that happens, I have enough support to replace her as the §Ynext premier§!. I'd do a much better job than her; that is something everykirin can agree with. And that also affords me the opportunity to make a few changes that benefit those who have given the most for the modernization of the Realm. I know many partners and connections who would benefit greatly if those labor rights were §Yremoved§! from the Charter, for instance..."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_3_entry_3:0 "Today, my friends in Fragrance Shipyards and myself met with the Equestrian delegation over the transfer of §Yship schematics§! and blueprints into our hooves. While the designs of the ships they gave us were outdated by their standards, and the fire control systems and battery schematics were similarly antiquated to the modern world, they obsolete the three ships we raised from Fragrance's harbor to the point where they'd only serve well as training dummies. But this transfer of knowledge wouldn't even be possible without the efforts of our §Ymisguided premier§! in befriending the Equestrians. Even though she may be hopelessly outclassed by the requirements of her job, even a broken clock is right twice a day, as they say. The deal is not perfect, of course; in exchange for these blueprints and schematics, we had to agree to give Equestria §Yprospecting rights§! for any resources that they find in Kiria, so in exchange for a one-time gift of obsolete knowledge, they earned themselves a steady stream of valuable raw materials to siphon out of our nation. This won't hurt us in the short term, as Kiria is so underdeveloped and improperly exploited that we do not have a lot of resources immediately on hoof for delivery. In essence, we're only exchanging a small fraction of an already pitifully small potential in this deal. But we will be stung in the §Ylong term§! if we do not find a way to renegotiate or renege on the deal as we properly exploit the resources of our lands. Equestria will gain an ever-growing share of our material output, sapping us of what should be ours by right.\n\nWhile the deal itself went off without any complications, I had an unfortunate encounter with the delegate by the name of §YApplejack§!, one of Autumn Blaze's friends and supposedly a member of the so-called §YElements of Harmony§!. I think she was supposed to represent Honesty if I recall correctly, which is a useful trait to have when negotiating a business deal, though I did not care all that much to properly commit it to memory. Magic artifacts are useful tools but their importance is increasingly diminishing in a modern era of technology and science. At any rate, the mare pulled me aside after the meaning and tried to give me a lecture about §Yproper cooperation§! with the other leaders of the Plenum. And though she did not outright say it, she implicitly accused me of using the Plenum for the benefit of my friends and myself over the benefit of the Realm. While she is correct that the path of modernization I wish to take Kiria on does directly benefit the returning diaspora like myself, it also stands to greatly benefit the Realm as a whole, and cooperation with my colleagues only comes when they meet me halfway. It is not fair for one party to bend over backwards to please an uncompromising partner, after all. I did try to explain this to her, but the mare must be part donkey—that would explain her stubbornness, at least. It seems that the only system she's willing to accept and understand is one that directly mimics the §YEquestrian model of Harmony§!, and anything else is completely foreign to her. Now, at least, I understand where Autumn Blaze learned her hopeless idealism from.\n\nProper cooperation with my peers does still remain an elusive ideal, I will admit, and not one that I can easily reach. Many of the ideas of the other cliques are §Ysimply incompatible§! with a modern Kiria, particularly the traditionalist nonsense that priestess Winter Frost spouts out during every session of the Plenum. I cannot afford to compromise with her too much, else I will lose the backing of my followers and supporters. They wish to see a §Yproperly modernized§! Kiria, not one laden with the burden of outdated religious philosophy, and if I am perceived to be too weak, then I will be ousted as the NAKP's leader. Even in this, life is like a business, and an incapable executive must be replaced for the good of the company. Only in this case, the company is the country, and it cannot have a weak executive board if it is to prosper and be profitable. I will have to be careful to find the right balance between §Ycompromise and dissent§! if I am to steer the fortunes of both Kiria and myself to a more profitable tomorrow."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_4_entry_1:0 "There is perhaps nothing quite so refreshing and relaxing as traveling the roads of our splendid nation—especially when those roads are §Yfreshly laid§!, no less.\n\nIt is a humbling experience that truly brings one closer to Concord, and it is a communion that can be shared with one's company and the kirin that she crosses paths with along the way. My fellow mystics and I have spent the past several weeks traveling along the new roads laid down in the §Yrural west§! of our realm, spreading the glorious news about §YThe Rising Fire§! and how we must adapt the tenets of Concord's faith to a new day. The Silence has taught all of us who follow The Rising Fire important lessons; namely, that we do not need a pyramidal religious order to understand her intentions, that we do not need the temptations of the modern age that turn us away from her glory, that we do not need the legal codes and shackles of some foreigner's ideas of governance to run our nation in defiance of Concord's will. Verdant and Chrysanthemum §Ythrived§! during The Silence, because we learned how to properly interpret and adapt Concord's intentions to the century of communal isolation that it bestowed on the realm. Common kirin organized in their communities, each finding their own meaning in Concord's creations, and working together for a truly classless and equal society can do more good for Kiria than §YThe Way of Fire§! ever could in the modern era. The doctrines of yesteryear belong in yesteryear, and they must modernize too along with the times if they are to hold sway in the future we proudly strive towards.\n\nWe have spread the news and beliefs of our doctrine to §Ycountless kirin§! on the roads we have traveled, and we have been repaid amply in the kindness of strangers and even by the government officials of our Matriarch Superior. Wherever we travel, somekirin is willing to offer us a place to stay for the night and a warm meal, as it is well known that to treat one of Concord's priests with kindness §Yinvites her blessings upon your household§!. And government officials give us alms and gifts, encouraging us to continue to spread the word about the end of The Silence and motivate the populace to rejoice. Though most do so perhaps mistakenly; they believe that we are priests of the old tenets of The Way of Fire, not mystics of The Rising Fire, and doubtless we would get into heated confrontations with them if they knew the truth; most officials from Vermilion I have gotten to know are §Yfairly dogmatic§! in their old beliefs, and would not react well to anykirin professing something some would see as §Yheretical§!. But what they do not know will not harm them, and it will make our lives easier as we continue to spread the word.\n\nWe have enlightened many converts today, just as we did the day before, and as we will continue to do tomorrow. We are the §Yforefront of a movement§!, the tip of the spear, and the fruits of our labor will one day be sweet to savor. Until then, we must do our best to make sure Concord's true divine will is heard throughout the nation."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_4_entry_2:0 "The wonders of modern technology are truly a blessing from Concord. Where once we roamed from town to town and village to village by hoof, the advent of modern transportation in the form of §Ythe railroad§! has greatly aided us in spreading the beliefs of The Rising Fire to the kirin of the realm. We can visit several towns in a day, whereas before we could only visit one town in several days, stopping at inns or farms along the road and speaking to only a hoofful of kirin before moving on. With such an efficient vector for proselytisation as the railroad, the Rising Fire is spreading §Yfaster than ever§!, and more and more kirin in more and more towns are finding the truth in our teachings. This is truly one of the greatest boons our movement has ever seen, and proves that modernization and The Rising Fire are made for each other.\n\nWhen night falls and the day's tracklaying has ceased, miniature shantytowns spring up at the end of the line. They are populated by an §Yentirely new class§! of kirin who are more than eager to embrace The Rising Fire. On any given day, I speak to tracklayers, coal miners, mechanics, and even sex workers who populate these transient railside camps. Many are pleased to have a job free of the dull monotony of farming and fishing, but they also feel §Yinadequately rewarded§! for the services they provide by the foreign businesskirin who employ them. The work they do is backbreaking and dangerous, and yet they barely earn more than farmers and fishers do for their labors. The Way of Fire does not care for them, and would rather that they §Ynot exist at all§!, as the traditionalist mystics and priests are wary of the new developments happening in the Realm. But §YThe Rising Fire supports them§!; they provide important labor for their communities, and in the eyes of Concord, they are favored by her divine blessing. Under our teachings and guidance, they are helping to build communities that will appreciate their work and reward them amply. We will do what the leaders of the realm will not do: acknowledge them, recognize their troubles, and treat them as equals. Such is Concord's will, and such is my purpose on this earth. As her faithful servant, I will not rest until §Yher will is fully realized.§!"

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_4_entry_3:0 "As of late, I've spent less time traveling the roads than I have staying in one place and writing letters. It is a queer transition and one that I'm not used to, but it is proving to be more effective. Since the §YTransmission Office§! was opened to receive petitions from kirin all across the realm, my followers and I have spent our time writing letters on behalf of the common kirin throughout the Realm, acting as their representatives to petition the Matriarch Superior through the office. It is a change that benefits the common kirin more than their leaders at the §YPlenum§! would believe. The Office of Transmission is designed to serve as a direct interface for the Matriarch to hear from her subjects when they cannot make the journey to Vermilion to petition her in person, but a large portion of our nation is still §Yilliterate§!, meaning it is useless to them. My fellow mystics and I are all literate by our training and education, and so we visit these kirin, put their complaints and desires onto paper for them, and make sure that they are received by the §YMatriarch herself§!.\n\nThis has been a great boon to the commoners, as otherwise, they lack the necessary influence to make their voices heard, especially by the leaders of the Plenum. Priestess Winter Frost is insular and myopic, and sees any kirin speaking out about how The Way of Fire has failed them as §Yheretic rabble to be ignored§!. Fickle Current is indifferent; he is foreign-born and foreign-educated, and sees himself above the afflictions and desires of the commoners, viewing them only as §Ytools to be used§! for his own personal gain. And Premier Autumn Blaze, though well-intentioned and caring, is naive and inexperienced, and simply §Ylacks the awareness and knowhow§! to address this problem. The harsh realities of modernization are leaving us common kirin behind, and so somekirin must serve as their herald and their champion. Just as I have always faithfully served §YConcord§!, so too shall I serve §Ythe poor and downtrodden§! of Kiria. And as they realize their voices are being heard and their complaints are being addressed, the common kirin of the Realm will remember who listened to them and who fought on their behalf, and they will remember that it was The Rising Fire that saved them—not §The Way of Fire§!."

KIR_rain_shine_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 2 April 945 in Vermilion\n\n§YBiography:§!: Matriarch Superior Rain Shine has lived her entire life upholding the imperial decrees that instituted the societal and cultural stagnation and decay of the Realm of Kiria, and never once did she imagine that she would be the kirin to undo them. The decrees had been issued by her mother, Matriarch Superior Noctilucent Charm, in 902, and when she passed in 971, Rain Shine swore upon her ascension pyre that she would maintain her mother's policies and devote her life to studying the Way of Fire and the teachings of the fire goddess, Concord, to protect Kiria.\n\nHowever, in 1006, an unexpected diplomatic mission from Equestria ventured into the isolated nation and reached Rain Shine's court in Vermilion. There, two bearers of the Elements of Harmony, Fluttershy and Applejack, argued that they had seen kirin living in poverty and squalor all throughout the realm as a result of The Silence, and while it was effective in preventing nirik transformations, it needed to end for the good of all kirinkind. They offered Equestrian aid in getting the nation back on its hooves, and Rain Shine, isolated from her subjects in the royal palace and oblivious to their plights, realized that continuing The Silence would only spell doom for her subjects in the long run. Though she had sworn to uphold her mother's policies, once Rain Shine learned of the terrible cost The Silence had on the people of Kiria, she agreed to repeal her mother's decrees and end it once and for all.\n\nNow, with The Silence ending in Kiria, Rain Shine has pledged to make up for her mother's mistakes and bring the kirin species into the modern age. But after 60 years of seclusion in Vermilion, Rain Shine may find that her authority is nowhere near as strong as her mother's was a century ago.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! Twotail813"

KIR_autumn_blaze_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 20 September 977 in Massicot\n\n§YBiography:§!: Autumn Blaze was never meant to rise as far as she has in her life, born the daughter to poor farmers in Massicot. Though originally destined for a life of the same hardships and meagre living as her parents, Autumn's family managed to get their daughter residence in a temple to Concord in Massicot at the age of seven, where she studied for five years before dropping out and returning to the family farm. In those five years, however, Autumn learned how to read and write, how to perform arithmetic, and perhaps most importantly of all, how to study and interpret the teachings of the fire goddess Concord in religious texts. Though she would never use that particular skill in service to The Way of Fire, Autumn made excellent use of her command over words as both a sword to attack with and a shield to defend against, allowing her to use it as a tool to carve her own path in life. Though she originally put it toward making musicals, plays, and even thought-provoking comedic dissections of the stagnation of kirin life under The Silence, it would serve her the best in 1006, when the Equestrian delegation to Kiria wandered into Massicot.\n\nBeing one of the only kirin in Massicot who knew Equiish because of her studies, Autumn was able to guide the Equestrians, two ponies named Fluttershy and Applejack, to Vermilion, where they sought to make contact with Kiria's Matriarch Superior, Rain Shine, and establish diplomatic ties. Because of her efforts, they were successful, and Autumn ultimately formed a close friendship with Rain Shine when all was said and done. That friendship led her to become Rain Shine's first premier, and guided her through the All-Kirin Plenum for National Revival as its steadfast and enthusiastic leader.\n\nNow, with her like-minded Harmonists in secure control over Kiria, Autumn can extend her influence once more, having learned many hard lessons from the Plenum. With the country in her hooves, she seeks to reconcile Kiria's traditionalist and theocratic past with a vision of a modern Harmonic nation like Equestria. Time will tell if she is successful.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! Twotail813"
KIR_rising_sun_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 13 July 969 in Chrysanthemum\n\n§YBiography:§!: Not much is known about the mare who calls herself Rising Sun, and what is known paints only a vague picture at best. By her own admission, Rising Sun was born in Chrysanthemum and studied to become a priestess in the Way of Fire, as such a lifestyle was the only way to escape the utter stagnation of The Silence while it still held Kiria in its stranglehold. But even as a priestess of The Way of Fire, the mare was often regarded by her peers as too smart for her own good and twice as cunning as the most mischievous fox. She would regularly debate her senior priests about the merits and drawbacks of strictly adhering to the Matriarch Superior's decrees when all they brought about was suffering and ruin for the people of Kiria, and was regularly chastised for it. For the mare who was too smart by half for the lifestyle she had chosen, Rising Sun had reached a frustrating theological dead end to the problems surrounding Kiria.\n\nRealizing that she would never advance as a priestess in The Way of Fire, Rising Sun sailed down the Mellifluve where she ultimately ended up in Verdant at the age of 20. Once there, she quickly realized that Verdant was prospering where Chrysanthemum languished. The Silence was still in full swing over the city, but the many island communities of Verdant had formed their own cooperative communes that worked together to the benefit of all without breaking any of the Matriarch's decrees. Additionally, there was no rigid religious structure that dominate the everyday lives of the kirin in the city, only an individual communion between the average kirin and Concord, with spiritual leaders to aid their followers along toward their own revelations. Rising Sun quickly immersed herself in these beliefs, and in no time at all, had risen to the top of this new sect of The Way of Fire. Naming her sect the Rising Fire, Rising Sun would return to Chrysanthemum to spread her new teachings to the kirin of the west, and made many visits to towns and workshops around Kiria before ultimately ending up in Vermilion as the Great Leap Forward progressed to bring her teachings to a new level of national awareness.\n\nNow, Rising Sun finds herself on top of the Realm's food chain, in a position of almost unlimited authority and power. The Rising Fire has risen with her as well, and her beliefs are ready to be shared across the Realm. The Rising Fire is grappling with The Way of Fire, and Rising Sun will be the one to bring about a new era of theology and change to Kiria, one it never could have imagined before.\n\n§YPortrait by:§!

During that time, she travelled around the world, venturing throughout Zebrica and Equus and learning many things about more modern societies. After the Silence was lifted, she returned to her homeland and joined the army, eagerly telling others of what she had seen. Already, she has risen to a high rank and wishes for the army to be modernized.\n\nShe is a friendly and affectionate kirin who is curious about the world and loves meeting members of other races. As her name suggests, she is skilled in ice magic and her Nirik form has blue flame.§!"
