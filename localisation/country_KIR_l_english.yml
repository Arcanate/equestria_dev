### Events ###
kirin.1.t:0 "Daybreak Over Vermilion"
kirin.1.d:0 "Matriarch Superior Rain Shine set her brush aside and watched as the last of the black ink dried on the flattened scroll of parchment before her. It had taken her weeks to get to this point, but now, for the first time in her 46 years of rule, she had signed an Imperial decree that would be read all throughout the Realm of Kiria. With that final brushstroke, and with the copies that the scribes would make in the morning and distribute to the far reaches of the country, The Silence, her mother's legacy, would come to an end after over a century of stagnation and decay.\n\nIt did not make her happy. If anything, Rain Shine felt nervous, wondering if what she was doing was the right thing for her subjects — subjects she had never met before. But her thoughts were stolen away from that when a servant entered and announced that Autumn Blaze was waiting to see her, and the mare in question entered a few moments later at Rain Shine's behest. Autumn bowed before her Matriarch, though Rain Shine keenly noted the awe and reverence the lesser kirin offered her at witnessing her regal body, and stood up. "You wished to see me, Matriarch?" Autumn asked.\n\n"I did," Rain Shine said, and her magic lifted a separate scroll off of her desk, neatly wrapped in a vermilion ribbon, and passed it to Autumn Blaze, who took it in her own telekinetic grip. "With The Silence ending, I am bringing together kirin from all across the Realm to discuss how we can rebuild our nation and bring it into the modern age. I am calling the first All-Kirin Plenum for National Revival... and as the mare who was so instrumental in helping the Equestrian delegation reach Vermilion, I want you to be its Premier."\n\nAutumn Blaze looked shocked at the sudden responsibility, but she nevertheless nodded and bowed again. "I... I'm not sure if I'm ready for that responsibility, Matriarch, but if you think so..."\n\nRain Shine cut her off with a wave of her hoof and an assuring smile."
kirin.1.a:0 ""You will do well, Autumn. I know this much.""

kirin.2.t:0 "Newcomers to the Imperial Court"
kirin.2.d:0 "Notable kirin from all across the Realm of Kiria, and even some from beyond its borders, have begun to arrive in the Imperial capital of Vermilion, heeding Matriarch Superior Rain Shine's calls to assemble delegates for the first All-Kirin Plenum for National Revival. The Plenum seeks to undo the damage wrought by a century of imperial decrees collectively known as The Silence that led to the stagnation and collapse of kirin society, and find new ways to rejuvenate the nation while avoiding the uncontrolled modernization that led to the necessity of The Silence a hundred years ago. For the first time since 903, Vermilion is waking up.\n\nMatriarch Superior Rain Shine has made it a personal note to greet and welcome all of the delegates as they arrive in the capital, and for most kirin, this is the first time ever seeing their Matriarch, who has until this moment remained largely self-isolated to the Imperial palace and its surrounding grounds and gardens. A sense of excitement and euphoria hangs in the air as this dark chapter of kirin history closes, and a new one can now be penned.\n\nYet as the delegates begin to assemble in the capital, tense lines are already being drawn between cliques with very different ideas on how their nation is to modernize. One clique, a traditionalist sect led by a prominent priestess of the Way of Fire by the name of Winter Frost, seeks to reaffirm the authority and devotion owed to Matriarch Rain Shine, as it was to her mother, Noctilucent Charm, before The Silence began. Another, led by Fickle Current, the grandson of once-prominent businesskirin who fled the city of Fragrance upon the imposition of The Silence, seeks to remake the nation through the lens of modern capitalism and industrialization, perfected by the griffons of Griffonia. Even the entrances of these two cliques could not have been more different. Winter Frost's fellow mystics arrived on hoof, many having walked hundreds of miles just to partake in the Plenum. Fickle Current and his compatriots, meanwhile, arrived via motorcar, the vehicles imported from Griffonia, dazzling the common kirin who had never seen such machines before.\n\nDespite the fact the two cliques stand at stark contrast to each other in their goals and ideas, both cliques have begun to clash with the kirin who have started to assemble themselves around Premier Autumn Blaze, who wishes to revitalize kirin society through the Equestrian model of modern peace and harmony. As more delegates enter the capital and the cliques attract more members and harden their beliefs, what has started as a hopeful new era for the Realm of Kiria could quickly turn into the next chapter of The Silence's dark legacy."
kirin.2.a:0 "Hopefully cooler heads will prevail."

kirin.3.t:0 "Messengers from Vermilion"
kirin.3.d:0 "Over the past few weeks, imperial heralds and envoys have fanned out across the Realm of Kiria, each carrying with them dozens of copies of Matriarch Superior Rain Shine's first imperial decree. Kirin all over the Realm are learning that The Silence is over, its imperial decrees repealed, and that Rain Shine is reasserting the authority of the Vermilion Dynasty over her realm once more. No longer will kirin have to live in poverty and squalor, suffering in stagnation as the cultural wheels of kirin society lay rusted in place. New ideas may be discussed again, currency will soon have a reestablished value, and diplomatic connections with foreign nations will be established once more. Additionally, the imperial heralds invited any kirin who were interested or able to attend the All-Kirin Plenum for National Revival in Vermilion, where the Matriarch Superior has undertaken an impressive effort to overhaul the nation and peacefully bring it into the modern age. The ideas of the common kirin are to be valued, not suppressed, and together, the kirin of Kiria can forge a new chapter in their species' history.\n\nThe news has been met with mixed, though optimistic, reactions throughout the Realm. The younger generations and those living like ghosts in the depopulated urban centers have rejoiced at the news, seeing it as a way to make their nation great once more. The older generations and those who fervently follow The Way of Fire, however, are far more wary. For them, The Silence has led to peace and stability in the Realm; nirik transformations are almost unheard of. Many still remember the reasons why The Silence was implemented in the first place, of the terrible fires that nearly destroyed Vermilion in 902, and the class warfare that erupted between peasants and industrialists and the violent mass nirik transformations it spawned. Kiria already tried to modernize once and almost went down in flames; how will this attempt lead to a different result?\n\nRegardless of the opinions of the populace, only one thing is certain: The Silence is over. As of yet, nokirin knows whether that will be Kiria's salvation or its undoing."

kirin.6.t:0 "The All-Kiria Collegium"
kirin.6.d:0 "Autumn Blaze let out a sigh of relief and stretched her sore legs as the last of the bills to lay the foundation of the All-Kiria Collegium, Kiria's first modern university and heavily inspired by academics from Yale, finally passed the floor by a razor thin margin. The contentious issue that had turned what should have been a good idea everykirin could agree on into a parliamentary nightmare had been the university's stance on religion: the university was officially secular, and would not make mandatory the attendance of sermons and the observance of holy days that were crucial to The Way of Fire. Winter Frost's religious clique had fought tooth and nail to reject the proposed university's secularism, claiming that it would corrupt kirin intellectuals for generations to come and only breed heresy and disrespect for Concord, while Fickle Current and his proposed dean of the new school, Cypress Snow, had claimed that removing religion from the lecture hall would allow new ideas to grow without the shackles of tradition and mysticism to hold them down. The debate had been furious and lasted for hours, and in the end, it fell on Rain Shine and her supporters to decide the matter in Current's favor. The university would be secular, and Cypress Snow would be its dean.\n\nBut that had not been the end of it. As soon as the floor cleared from the vote, Winter Frost stood up in her booth and put her hooves on the vermilion rail separating the seats from the plenum center. "If we are going to plant the seeds of heresy in our garden, we must at least have somekirin to watch over it and pluck the weeds as necessary," she began. "I motion that the Collegium be placed under the jurisdiction of the Reform Bureau. This kind of right-wing radicalism that Current and his cronies bathe in must not be allowed to breed at our academic centers, or we will have turned our backs on Concord and the Matriarch Superior!"\n\nFickle Current was quick to respond, hopping to his hooves after only having taken his seat moments before. "You lost the fight over the university, and now you wish to cripple what you cannot control!" he spat back at her. "The traditionalists control the Reform Bureau; you would stifle our academics instead of letting them grow and blossom." Before Frost could respond, he turned to Autumn Blaze and addressed her directly. "Premier, your faction decided the last vote, so put an end to this one as well. Do not let Winter Frost and her traditionalists censor this university, or the future of the kirin literati will suffer for it.""
kirin.6.a:0 "The Collegium must be independent!"
kirin.6.b:0 "The Reform Bureau will curtail the spread of radical ideas."

kirin.7.t:0 "Verdant in Bloom"
kirin.7.d:0 ""There is another issue I want to talk to you about."\n\nAutumn Blaze looked up from her tea at Fickle Current, a small frown curving her lips as she met Fickle Current's eyes. The businesskirin always wore a suit, and today was no different, even in the heat outdoors. It made him look intelligent and sharp, but also marked him as an outsider, somekirin who hadn't lived in the Realm during The Silence, instead thriving in Griffonia until the time was right to return to the home of his grandparents. Every time he said something, Autumn had to remind herself that the two of them might as well be different species; the only thing they had in common was their race, and their hopes for bringing the Realm out of the dark century of The Silence—though even in that, they differed.\n\n"These 'Rising Fire' heretics... they're growing ever more powerful in Verdant," Current continued, unaware of or simply indifferent about Autumn's frown. "Communalists who think that The Silence was a beneficial realignment of kirin society, and that our treasured Way of Fire has failed us. They've even started attracting Marksists and Stallionists to their numbers. You know what those are, correct? A violent revolutionary ideology that thrives in toppling monarchy and castrating the beneficial ventures of capitalism?"\n\n"In some opinions, yes," Autumn demurred. "But I believe in the Great Leap Forward. We can incorporate everykirin's ideas into rebuilding our nation. Cooperation makes us stronger."\n\n"And divisions make us weaker. They must be stopped, and they must be crushed now before it is too late," Current urged her. "Use the power of your position to officially denounce and disperse this filthy corner of our society. Do it now, before their heresy grows, and our Matriarch Superior is the next monarch to be overthrown.""
kirin.7.a:0 ""I believe in the Great Leap Forward. How can we leap forward if we leave kirin behind?""

kirin.9.t:0 "Harmony, Heritage, Homeland"
kirin.9.d:0 "As the All-Kirin Plenum for National Revival goes on, what was originally a call for reform—Harmony, Heritage, Homeland—has become a rallying cry for the three cliques that have swiftly formed with the Plenum's maturation. Premier Autumn Blaze and her supporters advocate for Harmony, a platform of liberal reformism that seeks to align the Realm of Kiria with the ideas and tenets of the Equestrian model. Renowned priestess Winter Frost and the religious sect of the Plenum believe in the kirin heritage, seeking to remember the traditions that once made Kiria a wonderful and prosperous nation, and to remember the Way of Fire and the fire goddess Concord for bringing the oftentimes violent kirin race together into a peaceful theocracy, an ideal once thought impossible six centuries ago. Those who have made Homeland their rallying cry are led by Fickle Current, the grandson of businesskirin who fled the Realm a century ago when The Silence began, and who has now become the leading voice for the return of the kirin diaspora and literati. All three have very different ideas of how to modernize the nation and shake off the vestiges of The Silence, and in many aspects, their ideas are incompatible with each other's. As the debates and deliberations drag on, one of these factions will eventually find an edge over their competitors and win more delegates over to their side. The question now becomes the following: which faction is the one truly blessed by Concord's divine wisdom?"
kirin.9.a:0 "Premier Autumn Blaze's liberal reformism!"
kirin.9.b:0 "Winter Frost's conservative traditionalism!"
kirin.9.c:0 "Fickle Current's nationalist revivalism!"

kirin.10.t:0 "In the Hall of the Matriarch Superior"
kirin.10.d:0 "Matriarch Superior Rain Shine watched the delegates assemble in their seats for the day's session of the Plenum with a note of concern. What had started out as a heterogenous mixture of kirin and their ideas at the beginning of the plenum had differentiated itself into three homogenous groups as time went on, with kirin attaching themselves to cliques of like-minded individuals and all sitting grouped together. Slowly but surely, discussion and mingling between all the delegates had all but ceased, and now the delegates had firmly attached themselves to their preferred leader and ideals: Premier Autumn Blaze and her liberal reformists, Priestess Winter Frost and her traditionalist sect, and the businesskirin Fickle Current and his cabal of industrialists and literati. Those three factions had turned the free-flowing exchange of ideas into hard-fought political debates, most of which were only resolved when two cliques ganged up on the third to enforce their compromise over the other party. Her presence as Matriarch Superior forced her delegates to take a step back and calm down when they began to get angry, lest one transform into a nirik in the presence of their Matriarch, yet even still, tempers readily flared.\n\nBut even her powerful and respected presence nearly failed in controlling the assembly when the doors opened and a large procession of priests and mystics in vibrant red and gold robes entered the hall, followed by a score of poor farmers. They had barely begun to fill out a bank of empty seats before Winter Frost jumped to her hooves and spat in their direction. "Heretic!" the priestess raged, pointing a hoof directly at the fiery mare who led the procession in. "Your twisted mockery of the Way of Fire is not welcome before the sacred presence of our Matriarch Superior! Leave now, or I will drag you down the palace steps and toss you out of Vermilion myself!"\n\nWinter Frost's fellow mystics joined their voices to hers, and even some of Fickle Current's clique and Autumn Blaze's allies began to boo and hiss as the Premier struggled for control. Yet none of that seemed to disturb the newcomers' leader, who simply turned about to face Rain Shine directly and bowed low. "Divine Matriarch, my name is Rising Sun, and my followers have traveled a long way to meet you," she said. Her voice was shrewd and sweet, and when Rain Shine looked into the mare's eyes, she saw a cunning cleverness hiding in their fiery depths. "You have called, and the kirin of the west have answered. The order of the Rising Fire is here to participate in this renewal of our great nation... despite the wishes of our misguided contemporaries." At that, she raised her head from the ground and smirked at Winter Frost, whose mane had already begun to smolder as pink and red embers danced among her eyelashes. Rain Shine knew she would have to be decisive and pick her words carefully, lest the Plenum turn into a mass nirik event that hadn't been seen in a hundred years."
kirin.10.a:0 "The kirin of the west shall be allowed to stay."
kirin.10.b:0 "We cannot give heretics a voice in Vermilion."

kirin.11.d_1:0 ""And now we move onto the next topic: the revitalization of the Morning Secretariat, as official advisors to the Matriarch Superior on matters of state."\n\nAutumn Blaze looked around the Plenum, trying to assess the thoughts and feelings of her peers as they brought the topic to table. She didn't have to wait long for Winter Frost to speak, and frowned when the priestess waved a dismissive hoof. "The Morning Secretariat has continued to serve its function unperturbed by The Silence. The mystics have served our Matriarch Superior well, as I'm sure she can attest, and her mother before her. I move we dismiss this topic and focus on more important matters at hoof."\n\nAutumn quickly shook her head and launched into her retort. "The mystics of the Way of Fire have had sole representation to our Matriarchs for hundreds of years. During The Silence, they were so focused on meditation and spirituality that they failed to clue the Matriarch in on how the common kirin suffered under her mother's decrees. I mean, I'm pretty sure everykirin who isn't wearing robes and doesn't spend their time reading books and staring at mountains trying to figure out what Concord is trying to tell them thought it was a pretty awful time. I sure did! And The Silence wouldn't have lasted this long had the Morning Secretariat had a few voices who weren't obsessed with the Way of Fire on it. We need more diverse representation. I move that we elect a new Morning Secretariat from the members gathered here in the Plenum, to advise the Matriarch on matters of our rapidly changing state as we modernize."\n\n"I agree," Fickle Current cut in from across the room. "Our Matriarch, blessed as she is with Concord's wisdom, will not be well served by traditionalists stuck in the past, when the Realm's future is in the... well, future. I will support your plan, Premier, but in return, I ask a favor." The businesskirin made a show of clearing his throat and raised his voice to make his words clear to the rest of the Plenum. "Ever since the tragedy of 902, the merchant class has been banned from seeking audiences with the Matriarch, let alone approach her in any official capacity as an advisor. My grandparents and great-grandparents were scapegoats for what befell our nation; now, the Realm needs kirin like them, kirin like me, merchants who can provide the knowledge and capital to forge our path forward. I ask that the merchant class be allowed to serve on the Secretariat, and additionally, ten of the seventy seats will be reserved for business and industry representatives. It is they, after all, who are providing the backbone for the Realm's modernization.""

Rain Shine steps up and, in a display of regal authoritativeness, commands the Secretariat to calm themselves. She then looks to Autumn Blaze for judgement upon the matter of the role of the way of fire within the modernising Kirin state."

Autumn Blaze notes that Rising Sun has taken great care not to invoke the name of the Rising Fire in her speech. (implication: Rising Sun is actually a very shrewd politician, moderating her rhetoric so as to gain political concessions.) After Rising Sun's speech, much of the Secretariat -- the communalists, most of the harmonists, and some of the traditionalists -- are in support of Rising's proposal."

### Diary Entries ###
KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_1:0 "I left Vermilion a few weeks ago to go visit the new steelworks that have been erected in Fragrance and Rhapsody, argued for and funded in large part by §YFickle Current§! and his like-minded business partners. I've traveled a little bit around the Realm as part of the job, and even a little bit before that when §YThe Silence§! still had our people locked in its grasp, but I've never been this far north. I thought all of our realm was like Vermilion or Massicot, either withering cities dwindling as they decayed, or small villages full of kirin trying to scratch out simple lives with no support or assistance from the government. But Fragrance and Rhapsody are nothing like that! They are still splendid cities, places that tried so very hard to resist the economic and societal collapses of The Silence, and managed to save some of our culture and way of life from before The Silence brought everything to a standstill. I don't know how better I could describe it. The kirin in these cities still have life and color in them, a sense of optimism that tomorrow is going to be a §Ybetter day.§! That's something I share with them, and it made me oh so happy to see it during my travels.\n\nOh, shoot, I'm getting off topic. Or am I? I don't know. Anyway, the §Ysteelworks§! that Fickle Current's clique funded are an amazing sight to behold. These aren't just workshops where blacksmiths forge steel and work their craft; this is something else entirely, a §Ymodern revolution§! that was smothered in Kiria a century ago, but was refined and perfected by the griffons of Griffonia and the ponies of Equus. These are entire factories filled with heavy machinery powered by electricity (another invention from over the seas; it makes me realize just how small my world was growing up in The Silence!) and guided along by workers who pull levers, hit buttons and somehow wrangle these machines into doing all the work for them. And the results can't even be compared to the work of smithy workshops and guilds; these factories can produce §Yin a day§! what an entire guild of talented blacksmiths can produce in a year! Sure, it loses some of that personal touch, but when we're trying to drag our entire nation into the modern era after a century of sitting on our hooves, this industrialization is practically a blessing sent by §YConcord§! herself. Current and his friends might be a little too cynical and greedy for my tastes, but the inventions they're bringing in from overseas, and the capital they're investing in setting up our industry, more than makes up for it. I can only hope that some of the fruits of their labor can make its way down to the ponies working in the steel mills; those I talked to said they worked §Yten or twelve hours a day§! in the scorching heat, with only a few breaks throughout the day. But it pays better than farming (so I've been told), and besides, we kirin like the heat anyway. It's a rough start for many of these workers, but I feel that given enough time and hardwork, this will all pay off for them like it will for the rest of us. We just have to believe in the future we're all building §Ytogether.§!\n\nI believe in that future, and in the Matriarch Superior, and in Concord's blessings. To some extent, I believe in Fickle Current and his compatriots too. We just have to work together to make the best use of the blessings Kiria has been given, and we can shape our future into anything we want it to be. And I'm going to do §Yeverything§! I can to help make it happen!"
KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_2:0 "Imperial Premier Autumn Blaze organising the first meeting of the Reform Bureau, which she heads. the Reform Bureau is effectively the entire government of Kiria, exercising centralised power with an imperial mandate. there are no other central governance bodies. Reform reform reform! But Fickle's capitalists and Winter's reactionary opposition will make things difficult. But Autumn remains optimistic, that everykirin will work together towards modernisation."
KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_3:0 "Autumn Blaze is shook. The furore in the Vermilion Court that culminated in the forceful explusion of the Rising Fire delegates has rattled her deeply. She has seen first hoof the ideological mettle of Fickle Current and Winter Frost, and she is no longer sure in her belief that every dispute can be peacefully resolved through dialogue and compromise. She becomes more wary and less trusting of the goals of Winter Frost and Fickle Current. She feels that she might not have been authoritative enough as Premier; maybe she should have ordered that the Rising Fire delegates be allowed to stay."

KIR_rain_shine_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 2 April 945 in Vermilion\n\n§YBiography:§!: Matriarch Superior Rain Shine has lived her entire life upholding the imperial decrees that instituted the societal and cultural stagnation and decay of the Realm of Kiria, and never once did she imagine that she would be the kirin to undo them. The decrees had been issued by her mother, Empress Noctilucent Charm, in 902, and when she passed in 971, Rain Shine swore upon her ascension pyre that she would maintain her mother's policies and devote her life to studying the Way of Fire and the teachings of the fire goddess, Concord, to protect Kiria.\n\nHowever, in 1006, an unexpected diplomatic mission from Equestria ventured into the isolated nation and reached Rain Shine's court in Vermilion. There, two bearers of the Elements of Harmony, Fluttershy and Applejack, argued that they had seen kirin living in poverty and squalor all throughout the realm as a result of The Silence, and while it was effective in preventing nirik transformations, it needed to end for the good of all kirinkind. They offered Equestrian aid in getting the nation back on its hooves, and Rain Shine, isolated from her subjects in the royal palace and oblivious to their plights, realized that continuing The Silence would only spell doom for her subjects in the long run. Though she had sworn to uphold her mother's policies, once Rain Shine learned of the terrible cost The Silence had on the people of Kiria, she agreed to repeal her mother's decrees and end it once and for all.\n\nNow, with The Silence ending in Kiria, Rain Shine has pledged to make up for her mother's mistakes and bring the kirin species into the modern age. But after 60 years of seclusion in Vermilion, Rain Shine may find that her authority is nowhere near as strong as her mother's was a century ago.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! Twotail813"
