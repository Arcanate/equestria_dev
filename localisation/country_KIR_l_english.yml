### Events ###
kirin.1.t:0 "Daybreak Over Vermilion"
kirin.1.d:0 "Matriarch Superior Rain Shine set her brush aside and watched as the last of the black ink dried on the flattened scroll of parchment before her. It had taken her weeks to get to this point, but now, for the first time in her 46 years of rule, she had signed an Imperial decree that would be read all throughout the Realm of Kiria. With that final brushstroke, and with the copies that the scribes would make in the morning and distribute to the far reaches of the country, The Silence, her mother's legacy, would come to an end after over a century of stagnation and decay.\n\nIt did not make her happy. If anything, Rain Shine felt nervous, wondering if what she was doing was the right thing for her subjects — subjects she had never met before. But her thoughts were stolen away from that when a servant entered and announced that Autumn Blaze was waiting to see her, and the mare in question entered a few moments later at Rain Shine's behest. Autumn bowed before her Matriarch, though Rain Shine keenly noted the awe and reverence the lesser kirin offered her at witnessing her regal body, and stood up. "You wished to see me, Matriarch?" Autumn asked.\n\n"I did," Rain Shine said, and her magic lifted a separate scroll off of her desk, neatly wrapped in a vermilion ribbon, and passed it to Autumn Blaze, who took it in her own telekinetic grip. "With The Silence ending, I am bringing together kirin from all across the Realm to discuss how we can rebuild our nation and bring it into the modern age. I am calling the first All-Kirin Plenum for National Revival... and as the mare who was so instrumental in helping the Equestrian delegation reach Vermilion, I want you to be its Premier."\n\nAutumn Blaze looked shocked at the sudden responsibility, but she nevertheless nodded and bowed again. "I... I'm not sure if I'm ready for that responsibility, Matriarch, but if you think so..."\n\nRain Shine cut her off with a wave of her hoof and an assuring smile."
kirin.1.a:0 ""You will do well, Autumn. I know this much.""

kirin.2.t:0 "A Letter from Autumn Blaze"
kirin.2.d:0 "Dear Applejack and Fluttershy,\n\nOh, I hope this letter reaches you two; it's not like Kiria hasn't had a functional postal system in a century, right? The hoops I had to go through just to send a piece of paper halfway across the world... \n\nI got a new job! Matriarch Superior Rain Shine (you remember her, right? The really tall kirin?) decided to call kirin from all across the realm to Vermilion to participate in the All-Kirin Plenum for National Revival, and she made ME its premier! Talk about a leap in responsibility, right? I've never led anything before, but I guess the Matriarch saw something in me when I helped you two make the last leg of the journey from Massicot to Vermilion. It's a lot to take on, and I'm not sure I'm the best kirin for the job, but I'll give it my best regardless!\n\nBut you should see Vermilion now! When you left, it was like a sleepy teenager asking for five more minutes of sleep, but now the city is absolutely bustling. I've never seen anything like it before! There are so many kirin from all over the realm pouring in every day to attend the Plenum, and there's this wonderful, colorful feeling of hope and excitement just buzzing through the air. I've spent a LOT of time meeting all the delegates I'll be working with during the Plenum, and two in particular really stuck out. The first is Winter Frost, one of our Way of Fire priestesses from Rhapsody, who's a bit of a stickler for tradition and knows way more about our fire goddess, Concord, than I could ever hope to learn. She's brought a whole bunch of priests and mystics in from across the realm to participate in the Plenum, and though I didn't do too well at my religious studies when I briefly considered considered becoming a mystic back in the day, I'm sure we'll have lots to talk about. The other kirin is a fellow called Fickle Current who's been living in Griffonia all his life. I didn't even know what Griffonia was until last month! But he's the grandson of some businesskirin who fled the realm when The Silence started, and he brought a lot of the kirin diaspora back with him to start fixing up the homeland. They even arrived at the capital in automobiles imported from Griffonia, which pretty much nokirin in the capital had ever seen before. To say he made a grand entrance would be an understatement, though I think that rubbed Winter Frost and her mystics the wrong way; the two of them don't seem like the got off on the right hoof, so to say. But I'm confident with time we'll be able to smooth those issues out at the Plenum. After all, we're all working together to better our nation, right?\n\nI hope you're doing well! Wish us the best of luck for the Plenum, because we're gonna need it!"
kirin.2.a:0 "Your friend, Premier Autumn Blaze"

kirin.3.t:0 "A Letter from the Premier"
kirin.3.d:0 "Most Divine Matriarch Superior,\n\nToday marks a week since you decreed that the imperial heralds would fan out across the realm and deliver the news of the All-Kirin Plenum for National Revival to the kirin of your domain. I'm pleased to report that the decree is proceeding swimmingly, apart from a few hiccups here and there, and your subjects are finally learning that The Silence is over. I've already been receiving reports from the envoys in the field that many towns and settlements are taking to the streets with joy and excitement, and I understand their feelings perfectly. You, Matriarch, are blessed with a lifespan that lasts twice as long as the rest of us, thanks to Concord's divine favor, so time must seem to feel twice as fast. Sixty years is hardly half your strengthened lifespan, but an entire generation of kirin has been born, raised, grown old, and is now passing on in that same time, having only known The Silence their entire lives. In a century from now, The Silence will have only been a fraction of your life, while it has come to dominate the lives of all of your subjects; ending it now and starting a new chapter for the kirin species fills all of us with joy and excitement at what tomorrow brings. The hardships we all were born into and lived through will soon feel like a distant memory now that we all, together, get to shape our destiny, and for that, you have won the undying love and devotion of all your subjects. I don't think I can possibly overstate just how great of a change this will be for all of us.\n\nEven still, I know this won't be easy, nor will the future we create for Kiria be what everykirin desires. Some kirin want to rapidly modernize us to catch up to the rest of the world, while others are far more cautious, remembering the disasters of modernization under your mother's rule. There will probably be bickering and arguing and fighting, but good things don't come to those who wait. They have to be fought for, and that's what we'll all be doing at the Plenum. With your guidance, I know we can create a bright new future for all kirin, and I'm thrilled to serve by your side.\n\nLet's do this together, and let's do it right."
kirin.3.a:0 "Your devoted servant, Premier Autumn Blaze"

kirin.4.t:0 "The Great Leap Forward"
kirin.4.d:0 "Matriarch Superior Rain Shine momentarily hesitated as she took to the podium placed on the steps before the imperial palace. Her red eyes shifted downwards and scanned over the hundreds... no, thousands of faces staring up at her. She had to remind herself that this was the first time most of her subjects had ever seen her in person. Rarely had she ventured outside of the palace walls all her life, and even rarer still had been any occasions to speak to her subjects, or let them speak to her. Her ascension through her mother's funeral pyre had been a quiet and closed affair within the palace walls, and only imperial proclamations to the kirin of Vermilion would have let any know that a change in leadership had taken place 36 years ago. Now, she stood before them as their new Matriarch Superior, ready to lead them out of the darkness of The Silence that had stifled kirin society for so long.\n\n"My faithful and loyal subjects," Rain Shine began, glancing down at the prepared speech in front of her and then back at the crowd. "I know this is the first time most of you have ever seen your Matriarch. I know this is the first time you have ever heard my voice. But a new era for Kiria could not begin without allowing you to meet me. I am not my mother. I am not the mare who created the decrees and laws that created what we call today The Silence. I am not Noctilucent Charm, but I am her daughter. And today, I will begin the atonement for my mother's mistakes."\n\nSurprised murmuring passed through the crowd, and Rain Shine let that proclamation sink in before continuing. "I have set in motion a series of decrees and appointments that will bring about the end of The Silence," she said. "Today is the beginning of a new era for Kiria. But I alone cannot forge our future. It is time for all the kirin of the Realm to join me in this future we create together. The kirin people must join me on a great leap forwards, a leap that will see us modernize our industry, our technology, our agriculture, and our science. This realm that has been entrusted to us by Concord is blessed by her wisdom and favor. We kirin are an ingenious people, a people who are intimately familiar with the creative and destructive force of fire. We will use our gifts to make the most of Concord's blessing. Through hard work, grit, and fervent devotion to the fire goddess, the Realm of Kiria WILL emerge from The Silence to become a world power within a decade. There is nothing that we cannot accomplish together!\n\n"So I ask of you, kirin of the Realm... will you join me in The Great Leap Forward?"\n\nThunderous applause and ecstatic cheering was the crowd's response, seemingly audible across the entirety of the Realm."
kirin.4.a:0 "The Great Leap Forward begins today!"

kirin.5.t:0 "Émigrés Return Home"
kirin.5.d:0 "Fickle Current watched from Fragrance's harbor as another ship pulled into port. The ships, varying in sizes from small mail ships to larger passenger ships, had been arriving in Kiria's northernmost port city by the day, each one loaded with dozens of kirin making the return to their ancestral homelands. These were the kirin of the diaspora, descendents of kirin who had the good sense to flee the Realm when The Silence began. Many had longed for home their whole lives, to reconnect with their people and their families, but unwilling to sacrifice their livelihoods to scratch out an impoverished living in squalor that such a move would force upon them. But now, with The Silence ending and Matriarch Superior Rain Shine inviting all kirin living abroad to return home and help modernize the nation, the diaspora had found the excuse it had been looking for to finally cease living abroad like exiles and return home as heroes.\n\nThe ship in front of Current had sailed in from Griffonia, judging by the flags hanging from its smokestacks, and the businesskirin pushed against the crowd surging off of the ship to find one particular face. He found it on the body of a green kirin with a white mane, and as soon as the two recognized each other, they stepped forward and embraced on the docks. "Current!" the green stallion exclaimed. "So good to see you! I feel like it's been years!"\n\n"Only a few, Cypress Snow, but years it has been." The two kirin stepped back, and then Cypress followed Current as the two began to move toward an automobile parked on the cobblestone roads by the docks. "I'm glad you came," Current continued as they walked. "Though I imagine giving up a position at Greenback University had to have been rough."\n\n"Not as rough as trying to educate you when you were my student," Cypress joked. "But I imagine that my talents will be better suited here than in Yale. The kirin here are in desperate need of somebody to educate them. We have to bring the Realm's standards up to snuff with the rest of the world, or we will be left behind."\n\nThe two sat down in the back of the automobile, and the driver slowly pulled away from the harbor. "The return of the diaspora is something the Realm desperately needs," Current agreed. "The kirin living here are all poor peasants living in the mud of their farms. The Realm needs us if it's ever going to make itself great again, even if half of these farmers see us as foreigners trying to end their way of life."\n\n"They should be happy about it," Cypress said with a derisive snort. "After all, we'll be doing all the work, and they'll be seeing all the reward. Or, well, most of it." He smiled at his former student. "I imagine the Matriarch will amply reward us for saving her nation when all is said and done.""
kirin.5.a:0 ""She will owe everything to kirin like us. That's a powerful debt to hold.""

kirin.6.t:0 "The All-Kiria Collegium"
kirin.6.d:0 "Autumn Blaze let out a sigh of relief and stretched her sore legs as the last of the bills to lay the foundation of the All-Kiria Collegium, Kiria's first modern university and heavily inspired by academics from Yale, finally passed the floor by a razor thin margin. The contentious issue that had turned what should have been a good idea everykirin could agree on into a parliamentary nightmare had been the university's stance on religion: the university was officially secular, and would not make mandatory the attendance of sermons and the observance of holy days that were crucial to The Way of Fire. Winter Frost's religious clique had fought tooth and nail to reject the proposed university's secularism, claiming that it would corrupt kirin intellectuals for generations to come and only breed heresy and disrespect for Concord, while Fickle Current and his proposed dean of the new school, Cypress Snow, had claimed that removing religion from the lecture hall would allow new ideas to grow without the shackles of tradition and mysticism to hold them down. The debate had been furious and lasted for hours, and in the end, it fell on Rain Shine and her supporters to decide the matter in Current's favor. The university would be secular, and Cypress Snow would be its dean.\n\nBut that had not been the end of it. As soon as the floor cleared from the vote, Winter Frost stood up in her booth and put her hooves on the vermilion rail separating the seats from the plenum center. "If we are going to plant the seeds of heresy in our garden, we must at least have somekirin to watch over it and pluck the weeds as necessary," she began. "I motion that the Collegium be placed under the jurisdiction of the Reform Bureau. This kind of right-wing radicalism that Current and his cronies bathe in must not be allowed to breed at our academic centers, or we will have turned our backs on Concord and the Matriarch Superior!"\n\nFickle Current was quick to respond, hopping to his hooves after only having taken his seat moments before. "You lost the fight over the university, and now you wish to cripple what you cannot control!" he spat back at her. "The traditionalists control the Reform Bureau; you would stifle our academics instead of letting them grow and blossom." Before Frost could respond, he turned to Autumn Blaze and addressed her directly. "Premier, your faction decided the last vote, so put an end to this one as well. Do not let Winter Frost and her traditionalists censor this university, or the future of the kirin literati will suffer for it.""
kirin.6.a:0 "The Collegium must be independent!"
kirin.6.b:0 "The Reform Bureau will curtail the spread of radical ideas."

kirin.7.t:0 "Verdant in Bloom"
kirin.7.d:0 ""There is another issue I want to talk to you about."\n\nAutumn Blaze looked up from her tea at Fickle Current, a small frown curving her lips as she met Fickle Current's eyes. The businesskirin always wore a suit, and today was no different, even in the heat outdoors. It made him look intelligent and sharp, but also marked him as an outsider, somekirin who hadn't lived in the Realm during The Silence, instead thriving in Griffonia until the time was right to return to the home of his grandparents. Every time he said something, Autumn had to remind herself that the two of them might as well be different species; the only thing they had in common was their race, and their hopes for bringing the Realm out of the dark century of The Silence—though even in that, they differed.\n\n"These 'Rising Fire' heretics... they're growing ever more powerful in Verdant," Current continued, unaware of or simply indifferent about Autumn's frown. "Communalists who think that The Silence was a beneficial realignment of kirin society, and that our treasured Way of Fire has failed us. They've even started attracting Marksists and Stallionists to their numbers. You know what those are, correct? A violent revolutionary ideology that thrives in toppling monarchy and castrating the beneficial ventures of capitalism?"\n\n"In some opinions, yes," Autumn demurred. "But I believe in the Great Leap Forward. We can incorporate everykirin's ideas into rebuilding our nation. Cooperation makes us stronger."\n\n"And divisions make us weaker. They must be stopped, and they must be crushed now before it is too late," Current urged her. "Use the power of your position to officially denounce and disperse this filthy corner of our society. Do it now, before their heresy grows, and our Matriarch Superior is the next monarch to be overthrown.""
kirin.7.a:0 ""I believe in the Great Leap Forward. How can we leap forward if we leave kirin behind?""
kirin.7.b:0 ""The risk of the Rising Fire heretics joining forces with Marksists is too great.""

kirin.8.t:0 "The Banners of Vermilion"
kirin.8.d:0 "Raine Shine stood in the massive plaza of the open-air Verdigris Rotunda outside of the imperial palace, counting the numerous colorful feathered banners fluttering in the slight breeze of the dreary day. A small drizzle had settled over Vermilion, and two of her palace servants used their magic to keep the rain off of her regal body, but the kirin assembled in the plaza before her stood tall, stoic, and proud. Some were young, barely more than colts and fillies, while some were older, their scales weathered and cracked with the passage of time. But one thing drew them all together, and those were the colorful banners they rallied around.\n\n"You few, you proud, gallant few," Rain Shine began, addressing the crowd with a respectful dip of her head. "You are the children, grandchildren, or even great grandchildren of the last soldiers to serve in my mother's Thousand Banners. Your ancestors served well in the Thousand Banners, and were rewarded amply with land upon which to start a family when they retired. Their children, and their children's children, served after them in the Banners. Like my own family, your families became strong military dynasties that will survive the worst the world can throw at them... even something like The Silence."\n\nHer eyes shifted to look out on the plaza, noting all the empty space unoccupied by the tiny gathering of kirin in front of her. "I summoned you here through imperial decree because it is time to rebuild the Thousand Banners of Vermilion. You will be the first to serve me, should you choose to follow in the hoofsteps of your ancestors. You will be made captains and officers, and you will protect the Realm from any threats, just as your forebears did. There are not a thousand banners standing before me, true, but I look forward to the day when this rotunda is filled with a thousand colorful banners, like a rainbow fallen onto the earth. But the first banners... they will be yours, and they will be honored by Concord's blessing. So I ask of you, kirin of the Realm: who will step forward and serve their Matriarch?"\n\nShe did not have to wait long for a response. One by one, the kirin under each banner stepped forward, carrying their banners with them for Rain Shine to bless with a touch of her magic. One by one, they knelt before her and swore their oaths to the Realm, just as their ancestors once did long ago. And one by one, Kiria earned its banners back on that day."
kirin.8.a:0 "Today, a hundred banners. Tomorrow, a thousand!"

kirin.9.t:0 "Harmony, Heritage, Homeland"
kirin.9.d:0 "As the All-Kirin Plenum for National Revival goes on, what was originally a call for reform—Harmony, Heritage, Homeland—has become a rallying cry for the three cliques that have swiftly formed with the Plenum's maturation. Premier Autumn Blaze and her supporters advocate for Harmony, a platform of liberal reformism that seeks to align the Realm of Kiria with the ideas and tenets of the Equestrian model. Renowned priestess Winter Frost and the religious sect of the Plenum believe in the kirin heritage, seeking to remember the traditions that once made Kiria a wonderful and prosperous nation, and to remember the Way of Fire and the fire goddess Concord for bringing the oftentimes violent kirin race together into a peaceful theocracy, an ideal once thought impossible six centuries ago. Those who have made Homeland their rallying cry are led by Fickle Current, the grandson of businesskirin who fled the Realm a century ago when The Silence began, and who has now become the leading voice for the return of the kirin diaspora and literati. All three have very different ideas of how to modernize the nation and shake off the vestiges of The Silence, and in many aspects, their ideas are incompatible with each other's. As the debates and deliberations drag on, one of these factions will eventually find an edge over their competitors and win more delegates over to their side. The question now becomes the following: which faction is the one truly blessed by Concord's divine wisdom?"
kirin.9.a:0 "Premier Autumn Blaze's liberal reformism!"
kirin.9.b:0 "Winter Frost's conservative traditionalism!"
kirin.9.c:0 "Fickle Current's nationalist revivalism!"

kirin.10.t:0 "In the Hall of the Matriarch Superior"
kirin.10.d:0 "Matriarch Superior Rain Shine watched the delegates assemble in their seats for the day's session of the Plenum with a note of concern. What had started out as a heterogenous mixture of kirin and their ideas at the beginning of the plenum had differentiated itself into three homogenous groups as time went on, with kirin attaching themselves to cliques of like-minded individuals and all sitting grouped together. Slowly but surely, discussion and mingling between all the delegates had all but ceased, and now the delegates had firmly attached themselves to their preferred leader and ideals: Premier Autumn Blaze and her liberal reformists, Priestess Winter Frost and her traditionalist sect, and the businesskirin Fickle Current and his cabal of industrialists and literati. Those three factions had turned the free-flowing exchange of ideas into hard-fought political debates, most of which were only resolved when two cliques ganged up on the third to enforce their compromise over the other party. Her presence as Matriarch Superior forced her delegates to take a step back and calm down when they began to get angry, lest one transform into a nirik in the presence of their Matriarch, yet even still, tempers readily flared.\n\nBut even her powerful and respected presence nearly failed in controlling the assembly when the doors opened and a large procession of priests and mystics in vibrant red and gold robes entered the hall, followed by a score of poor farmers. They had barely begun to fill out a bank of empty seats before Winter Frost jumped to her hooves and spat in their direction. "Heretic!" the priestess raged, pointing a hoof directly at the fiery mare who led the procession in. "Your twisted mockery of the Way of Fire is not welcome before the sacred presence of our Matriarch Superior! Leave now, or I will drag you down the palace steps and toss you out of Vermilion myself!"\n\nWinter Frost's fellow mystics joined their voices to hers, and even some of Fickle Current's clique and Autumn Blaze's allies began to boo and hiss as the Premier struggled for control. Yet none of that seemed to disturb the newcomers' leader, who simply turned about to face Rain Shine directly and bowed low. "Divine Matriarch, my name is Rising Sun, and my followers have traveled a long way to meet you," she said. Her voice was shrewd and sweet, and when Rain Shine looked into the mare's eyes, she saw a cunning cleverness hiding in their fiery depths. "You have called, and the kirin of the west have answered. The order of the Rising Fire is here to participate in this renewal of our great nation... despite the wishes of our misguided contemporaries." At that, she raised her head from the ground and smirked at Winter Frost, whose mane had already begun to smolder as pink and red embers danced among her eyelashes. Rain Shine knew she would have to be decisive and pick her words carefully, lest the Plenum turn into a mass nirik event that hadn't been seen in a hundred years."
kirin.10.a:0 "The kirin of the west shall be allowed to stay."
kirin.10.b:0 "We cannot give heretics a voice in Vermilion."

kirin.11.t:0 "Showdown at the Rotunda"
kirin.11.d_1:0 ""And now we move onto the next topic: the revitalization of the Morning Secretariat, as official advisors to the Matriarch Superior on matters of state."\n\nAutumn Blaze looked around the Plenum, trying to assess the thoughts and feelings of her peers as they brought the topic to table. She didn't have to wait long for Winter Frost to speak, and frowned when the priestess waved a dismissive hoof. "The Morning Secretariat has continued to serve its function unperturbed by The Silence. The mystics have served our Matriarch Superior well, as I'm sure she can attest, and her mother before her. I move we dismiss this topic and focus on more important matters at hoof."\n\nAutumn quickly shook her head and launched into her retort. "The mystics of the Way of Fire have had sole representation to our Matriarchs for hundreds of years. During The Silence, they were so focused on meditation and spirituality that they failed to clue the Matriarch in on how the common kirin suffered under her mother's decrees. I mean, I'm pretty sure everykirin who isn't wearing robes and doesn't spend their time reading books and staring at mountains trying to figure out what Concord is trying to tell them thought it was a pretty awful time. I sure did! And The Silence wouldn't have lasted this long had the Morning Secretariat had a few voices who weren't obsessed with the Way of Fire on it. We need more diverse representation. I move that we elect a new Morning Secretariat from the members gathered here in the Plenum, to advise the Matriarch on matters of our rapidly changing state as we modernize."\n\n"I agree," Fickle Current cut in from across the room. "Our Matriarch, blessed as she is with Concord's wisdom, will not be well served by traditionalists stuck in the past, when the Realm's future is in the... well, future. I will support your plan, Premier, but in return, I ask a favor." The businesskirin made a show of clearing his throat and raised his voice to make his words clear to the rest of the Plenum. "Ever since the tragedy of 902, the merchant class has been banned from seeking audiences with the Matriarch, let alone approach her in any official capacity as an advisor. My grandparents and great-grandparents were scapegoats for what befell our nation; now, the Realm needs kirin like them, kirin like me, merchants who can provide the knowledge and capital to forge our path forward. I ask that the merchant class be allowed to serve on the Secretariat, and additionally, ten of the seventy seats will be reserved for business and industry representatives. It is they, after all, who are providing the backbone for the Realm's modernization.""
kirin.11.d_2:0 ""And now we move onto the next topic: the revitalization of the Morning Secretariat, as official advisors to the Matriarch Superior on matters of state."\n\nAutumn Blaze looked around the Plenum, trying to assess the thoughts and feelings of her peers as they brought the topic to table. She didn't have to wait long for Winter Frost to speak, and frowned when the priestess waved a dismissive hoof. "The Morning Secretariat has continued to serve its function unperturbed by The Silence. The mystics have served our Matriarch Superior well, as I'm sure she can attest, and her mother before her. I move we dismiss this topic and focus on more important matters at hoof."\n\nAutumn quickly shook her head and launched into her retort. "The mystics of the Way of Fire have had sole representation to our Matriarchs for hundreds of years. During The Silence, they were so focused on meditation and spirituality that they failed to clue the Matriarch in on how the common kirin suffered under her mother's decrees. I mean, I'm pretty sure everykirin who isn't wearing robes and doesn't spend their time reading books and staring at mountains trying to figure out what Concord is trying to tell them thought it was a pretty awful time. I sure did! And The Silence wouldn't have lasted this long had the Morning Secretariat had a few voices who weren't obsessed with the Way of Fire on it. We need more diverse representation.

"How can the Secretariat advise our Matriarch if nokirin represents the laborers in the fields and the workers in the factories? I move that the Secretariat should be an elected body open to any kirin who wishes to run. It is the only way to ensure every voice is heard.""

She wasn't alone in that: the rest of the kirin assembled in the Plenum audibly gasped, including some of Current's own clique, and none more so than Winter Frost's traditionalist sect. "We cannot expect business and industry to be beholden to the teachings of The Way of Fire when our religious fundamentals were laid down before modernization of today's scale was scarcely dreamed of," Current continued, pushing on with a firm voice against the agitations of the Plenum. "Modernization relies squarely on one thing, and that is the free flowing river of currency from the hooves of the buyer into the hooves of the seller. When we are talking about the modernization of the present, thousands of tons of gold will exchange hooves in a season, and all of it has to be accounted for. Splitting off a portion of this gold in tithes, as has been done for centuries, will only hamper the rapid pace of modernization. What use does Concord have for our gold, I ask you? If we are to move forward as a nation and as a society, the stranglehold Concord's temples have on our economy must be loosened for the greater good. I therefore move that the tithes be abolished and sacred lands held by temples and monasteries be opened up for public use and private investment in an effort to speed up the modernization of the Realm. The old must yield to the new if we are to see tomorrow's sunrise."\n\n"You reject tradition!" Winter Frost screamed, and Autumn felt her gut clench as the priestess briefly flickered with fire and fury. "You do not know what it means to be a kirin! You are a foreigner trying to shape our nation in the image of heathens! Have you traded Concord's divine spark for a griffon's boundless greed?"\n\nThe temperature in the Plenum was rising, both figuratively and literally, as tempers began to flare. Thankfully, it was Rain Shine who stepped forward and put a stop to the brewing catastrophe merely by standing up. When the Plenum fell silent, she narrowed her eyes at everykirin assembled.

kirin.13.d:0 ""You have the floor," Autumn said after a moment's indecision. She tried to prepare herself for what would come next; doubtless letting Rising Sun and her heretical sect have a moment in the spotlight would lead to more headache than it was worth. But the Plenum could not be fair if all kirin didn't have a chance to speak, and so she let the priestess have the floor, despite her better judgment.\n\n"Thank you." Rising Sun raised her head from her bow, stepped out into the center of the Plenum, and turned to address her peers. She took only a moment to collect her thoughts before she began. "Mountains are not forever," she began, her piercing eyes slowly sweeping across the crowd. "Expecting a mountain to stand tall and resolute for ten thousand years is a foal's folly. They change with the weather, worn down season by season. What yesterday we thought was unchangeable will be tomorrow changed. So too must our teachings and our doctrines. Five centuries ago, The Way of Fire was the tallest peak in the mountain range, but it is different today that it was then. There is no shame in changing and adapting to fit the times," she said, her eyes stopping on Winter Frost for a moment before continuing on. "We must change and adapt if we want to survive. But we do not dam a river when instead it could be rerouted," she said, and this time her gaze settled on Fickle Current with a slight frown. "Common sense guides the spirit of Kiria now just as it did back then. We do not need to pretend the problems of today are the same as they were a century ago, nor do we need to pretend that we must start over if we are to combat them. The Way of Fire will learn to adapt with the forces of modernization, to work with it as a graceful dance partner, promoting equality, justice, peace, and harmony for all kirinkind. It will not be swept away by modernization, but instead will guide it to a brighter dawn. It will not abandon our sacred traditions, but seamlessly marry them to the future we create for ourselves here today. So I ask you, kirin of the Plenum, this simple question: why choose yesterday or tomorrow, when we could live together in the new today that we make for ourselves?"\n\nSomehow, Rising Fire's stirring words had moved kirin from all across the Plenum to applaud her speech. The delegates would vote as she saw fit, Autumn Blaze concluded, but she frowned as she spent a few more moments to dissect the priestess' words. She had never used the term 'The Rising Fire' to label her beliefs, but Autumn knew that it was what she'd proposed. The heretic was slowly worming new ideas into the Plenum, but there was nothing Autumn could do except hold a slight frown as Rising Sun grinned at her and the votes were cast."

kirin.14.t:0 "An Accord with Concord"
kirin.14.d_1:0 "Priestess Winter Frost did her best to hide her scowl as she watched her Matriarch Superior surrender her absolute authority over the Realm with ink brushed on paper. The entire Plenum had been moved outside to the steps of the Vermilion Palace, where Rain Shine read her latest imperial decree to the kirin of the capital, turning its words into law with her divine voice. But those words were not hers. Instead, they were the conniving traitors' words read through the Matriarch's voice, turning blasphemy into religious creed and curtailing Concord's divine influence on the world by weakening Her avatar. It made her blood boil, but she kept it all hidden under a neutral expression. A priestess of The Way of Fire could not go against the decisions of her Matriarch, no matter how much they irked her.\n\nInstead, she directed her ire toward Fickle Current and his cronies, their pleased expressions sickening her to her stomach. Not two days had passed since Current and the rest of his Griffonia-educated ilk had proposed a charter that stripped away much of Rain Shine's power under the pretense of simplifying and codifying the Realm's governance. Her divine authority had been transformed into legal power and stolen from her court by the Morning Secretariat, which Current and his friends had a very strong hoof in. Though the charter recognized Rain Shine's divinity, reaffirming her union with Concord at her ascension when she emerged from the flames of her mother's funeral pyre, it also removed her ability to speak directly for Concord and rule by decree, instead forcing her to earn the Secretariat's consent before making a decision that would affect the Realm. While the Matriarch's court would remain open for petitioners, the matter of ruling would now be handled almost exclusively by the Morning Secretariat.\n\nWinter Frost wasted no time in separating with her clique when the decree was finished and the delegates were allowed to go their separate ways. The less time she had to spend in the traitors' presence, the better. Something would have to be done about them, she told herself, lest the Kiria she knew and loved one day ceased to be."

"I do not need you making today any more intolerable than it already is."\n\nRising Sun merely chuckled at that. "The Rising Fire supports our Matriarch," she said. "This charter is just an unfortunate stopgap for the challenges we face. Our way survived The Silence, and it will survive this too." She gave Winter a sly smile as she added, "Perhaps one day you and I will see eye to eye on these things. We need not be enemies, not when our way of life is at stake.""

kirin.15.d:0 "Fickle Current slowly marched up the stairs toward the burnt-out town hall, passing by scores of kirin quietly sitting amongst the ashes in protest, their glares turned toward the imperial guards gathered around the perimeter. It was only his third time visiting Fragrance, his family's ancestral hometown, but this time he came as an ally in the government, rather than an emigrant returning on family business.\n\nAs soon as the news of the unrest in Kiria's once-largest city reached Vermilion, Current had immediately volunteered his time to go and resolve the matter on the Matriarch's behalf. As the procession of automobiles navigated the dirt roads between Vermilion and Fragrance, he had taken the time to read up on any information from Fragrance he could get his hooves on. As far as the reports went, Vermilion's attempt to assert its authority over its distant urban centers had been met with resistance in Fragrance, where the city's elected council refused to cede power to the Vermilion envoys up to the moment they were forcibly removed by the envoys' guard detail. The bad blood between Fragrance and Vermilion, reaching back to the beginning of The Silence, had boiled over, and a few nirik transformations had reduced the town hall to cinders. Now, the kirin protested by peacefully sitting in the courtyard of the demolished town hall, but the conviction in their beliefs had not died down in the slightest.\n\nAfter asking around, Current shortly found himself directed to Cherry Blossom, the city's mayor and organizer behind the protests. She looked up from the papers on her table as Current approached and frowned at him. "If you're here from Vermilion, then you might as well turn around and tell the Matriarch that we won't talk until her lapdogs are gone," she growled. "Fragrance refuses to do business with the kirin that sent us from riches to rags a century ago."\n\n"What about a son of Fragrance who will turn your rags back into riches?" Current sat down across from her and set his hat down by his side. "My grandparents lost everything when The Silence ravaged our city, just like yours. But I'm back to make it right again. My friends are powerful, and they are the driving forces behind the repeal of The Silence and the return of Fragrance's industry. You have my word as a delegate of the Plenum and a devoted son of Fragrance that I will do everything in my power to return our city to its former glory by shaping Vermilion policy from within. All I ask of you is to stand back and stand by until our moment of glory comes."\n\nCherry Blossom scowled, but after a moment she nodded in agreement. "If you can save Fragrance, then by all means, do so," she said. "But know it will take a lot from Vermilion to undo a hundred years of suffering. Fragrance will not be humiliated a second time.""

kirin.16.t:0 "In the Garden of Tranquil Florescence"
kirin.16.d:0 "Autumn Blaze again touched the piece of paper rolled up and hidden inside one of the pockets in her vermilion and golden robes as she observed the festivities in the Garden of Tranquil Florescence. It had been her masterpiece of her time as premier so far, a sprawling and lively festival to welcome Kiria back into the modern world by inviting delegations from all across the world to witness the resurgence of kirin culture with the end of The Silence. Delegations from Equestria, Aquileia, Wingbardy, and the Griffonian Empire were all present, along with envoys from many other nations, all bedazzled by the spectacles of kirin folk songs and dances, pyrotechnics, gymnastics, the military drilling of the elite kirin banners, and of course, seemingly endless kirin cuisine. The past two days had all been an effort to butter up the delegates and please them before giving her speech, in which she would politely ask for assistance from foreign nations in modernizing the Realm—modernizing a nation as large and disparate as Kiria within a few years would be impossible without outside help, after all. Hopefully, the foreign envoys would be able to secure favorable terms with their governments if they left Kiria pleased and amazed with what they saw.\n\nBut as Autumn prepared to give the speech, she still found herself wrestling with how to request foreign aid. Winter Frost and the traditionalists had pressured her to take a more moderate approach, to advocate for the righteousness of The Way of Fire and its tenet of living in harmony with nature rather than conquering it. Fickle Current, however, had urged her to found her request on Kiria's abundance of natural resources, simply waiting for foreign capital to be exploited and traded around the world. It left Autumn in an uncomfortable position: should she ask for help based on good faith and favors, or exchange the resources of her home for the money of foreigners?"

kirin.17.t:0 "The Despoiling of Hyacinth"
kirin.17.d:0 "To Premier Autumn Blaze,\n\nI am sending you this urgent letter requesting support for the kirin of Hyacinth in recovering from a pirate attack. According to the locals, about three days before our imperial delegation arrived in the city to reassert the Matriarch Superior's authority over the coastal town, a large pirate armada appeared on the horizon and quickly stormed the port. The pirates swiftly blockaded the port, disembarked from their ships, and stripped the town bare of any and all valuables the townsfolk possessed, even pressing some of the villagers into service aboard their ships before disembarking again. Such raids are not uncommon, the villagers tell me, and have been a somewhat regular occurrence for decades, ever since a large pirate haven was established on the Auburn Isle just off of Hyacinth's coast. The pirates do not kill or burn, I am told, as they treat the coastal villages like fruit bearing trees to be cultivated and harvested when the time is right, yet the frequent raids on these villages have stifled their growth and left them too weak to fend for themselves.\n\nEvery village I visited along the coast told similar stories. It is clear that something needs to be done, but until we can rebuild a navy of our own, it seems unlikely that anything CAN be done. How are we supposed to reassert the Matriarch's divine rule over all the Realm if we cannot protect those living on our coasts? One way or another, these pirates must be brought to heel and their armada disbanded. It is the only way to create peace and prosperity for the fishing villages and harbor towns along the coast. Until the pirate menace is dealt with, we will struggle to truly end The Silence in all of Kiria, and our efforts at modernization will never be successful.\n\nPlease bring this matter to the Matriarch Superior's attention at the first chance you get. Her subjects depend on it.\n\nOur Matriarch's loyal servant,\nFirecracker"

kirin.18.d:0 ""The Plenum now moves onto the matter of the evaluation of laws passed as part of The Silence's decrees," Autumn Blaze said, pulling the next proposal across her desk and skimming over the brief attached to it. "Fickle Current, since this is your proposal, how about you get us started off?"\n\n"Gladly," the industrialist said and, standing up, he took the podium to address his fellow delegates. "Members of the Plenum, we have already gone so far in revoking and repealing many of the ill-advised decrees that constituted the hundred year decay that brought our nation to where it stands today," he said. "The faults in these decrees were easy to see and were dismissed accordingly; likewise, the laws that filled in the spaces between Matriarch Noctilucent Charm's decrees should also be removed. Some of these laws explicitly ban little things like singing, dancing, and loud talking in public, and I think even priestess Winter Frost will agree with me that these measures are archaic and unnecessary in today's Kiria. Other laws, such as the banning of independent hierarchical organizations and capital punishment for nirik transformations, though seldom enforced, should likewise be removed. We must allow our society to grow with our nation, and these restrictions instead stunt it. Make nirik transformation a misdemeanor like public intoxication and do away with the rest, and we will be one step closer to a functional modern society."\n\nThough most kirin nodded in agreement, Winter Frost rose to voice her counterpoints, just as Autumn Blaze knew the priestess would. "While I may personally agree that some of these restrictions are trivial, were they not Concord's divine intention, passed through her previous avatar, Matriarch Charm?" she began. "Removing them would be blasphemy, and it is not up to us to decide what should be done. That is Matriarch Rain Shine's decision, not ours. But I must outright reject your proposal to remove the capital punishment on nirik transformations, Current, even if it has only been loosely enforced for the past few decades. We need a strong deterrent to prevent the transformation into the nirik state, now more than ever. Remove that and we only feed more fuel to the fire. Tempers will flare, and another bout of nirik transformations will be the calamity that sees all our progress permanently undone. It is not a risk we can afford to take, and so the only way to control it is to punish it with the harshest penalty imaginable. So, kirin of the Plenum, do we abandon the safeguards that prevented the complete destruction of our nation a century ago, or do we remember our traditions and the reasons why these safeguards were implemented in the first place?""

kirin.19.t:0 "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom"
kirin.19.d_1:0 "It was a nice change of pace, Autumn Blaze calmly noted, to be able to gather with the leaders of the other factions and enjoy dinner and drinks together after a hard day of hammering out policy and reform at the Plenum. It wasn't every day that the clique leaders could put aside their differences and enjoy a meal together—Winter Frost and Fickle Current certainly weren't inviting each other over for tea after a long day arguing—but on the rare days when the Plenum could pass its agenda nearly unanimously (or at least without heated arguments), Autumn liked to take the two out for dinner afterwards and relax. It helped to remind everykirin that they were all kirin and partners in this endeavor, not enemies to be defeated.\n\n"I think we can all agree that the ending of the Quiescence was for the betterment of our realm," Fickle Current said as they waited for their meals to be brought out to them. "One by one, we've rolled back Matriarch Noctilucent Charm's decrees that stifled our education system and banned the study of science, religion, and philosophy outside of what we already knew in 903. That's the mark of progress, right there."\n\n"The new freedom of information is helping us unravel more of Concord's mysteries," Winter Frost agreed. "Concord lives in science and philosophy as much as she does in our religion. The Way of Fire is not merely a matter of theology, it is the foundation of our society and everything that we do. Exploring how Concord's divinity influences the natural world around us is just as important as understanding how we can better strive to follow her teachings."\n\n"I recently read a report that came across my desk saying that the number of schools in the realm has multiplied a hundredfold in such a short time," Autumn added. "More kirin are gaining the gift of education than ever before, and at a higher quality than even we thought imaginable when we first started. That's cause for celebration, I think."\n\n"Agreed," Current said, and he lifted up his drink in his magic, prompting Autumn and Winter to do the same. "A toast, then, to Kiria's progress. We are making a dream that once seemed impossible into tomorrow's reality.""
kirin.19.d_2:0 "It was usually a nice change of pace, Autumn Blaze noted, to gather her fellow leaders of the Plenum together for dinner after a successful and (mostly) argument-free day. It was a good way to remind everykirin that they were all on the same team and all wanted to modernize Kiria; just because they had different ideas on how to go about it, they weren't supposed to be enemies in this process. She had hoped that today would be another one of those days, where Winter Frost and Fickle Current could stop going at each other's throats for an evening over a shared enjoyment of a good meal, but it was clear that things weren't going according to plan.\n\n"Repealing the Quiescence was supposed to be a good step forward," Winter Frost bemoaned. "Opening up the study of science, religion, and philosophy was supposed to foster a renewed vigor in the exploration of The Way of Fire. But Rising Sun and her heretics have hijacked it for their own agenda! They're using modern printing presses to print thousands of copies of Her Incandescent Will, a text that was banned for good reason before The Silence, under the guise of freedom of speech! They twist Concord's divine will to suit their own heretical interpretations of a communalistic society. Who knows how many righteous followers that harlot has corrupted with her blasphemy? She should have been run out of Vermilion the moment she showed her face in the Matriarch's holy presence!"\n\nFickle Current remained unsympathetic. "Perhaps if your fellow mystics did not shun progress, Rising Sun would not be outcompeting you," he said. "You fear printing presses and the inventions of modern society. You try to copy the teachings of The Way of Fire by hoof and horn with quill and ink, and act surprised when Rising Sun's followers print a thousand copies of her texts for every one of yours? Perhaps this is why The Way of Fire is losing influence while The Rising Fire grows ever stronger."\n\nWinter Frost slammed her hooves down on the table and abruptly stood up, glaring at Fickle Current. "If you will not support Concord's teachings and her holy will, then I will not share a meal with you," she growled, much to Autumn's dismay. "I am leaving." She turned to Autumn only to say "Good night, Premier," then stormed out of the restaurant without waiting for her meal to arrive. Fickle Current merely shrugged and watched her go, keeping his thoughts to himself."

She'd been stuck in her office all day, unable to get outside and enjoy some fresh air, all because she couldn't find the right way to word the draft of the bill in front of her. She was about to set it aside and try again later when the door to her study opened and a brown kirin stepped in with a fresh stack of papers for the Premier to look at. When the newcomer saw Autumn's exasperation, however, she paused in the doorway and frowned. "Autumn? Is this a bad time?"\n\nAutumn sighed and waved the kirin in. "No, Cinder Glow, it's not. I've just been beating my face against the table for Concord knows how many hours now, and I've gotten basically nowhere with this draft of our new constitution!" She let out a groan and slouched back in her seat. "This is nothing like writing up musicals back in Massicot!"\n\nCinder Glow bit her lip and stepped closer. "What's the problem, then?" she asked her premier and party leader. "Read it out to me. Maybe that will help you figure some things out."\n\n"Well, it's worth a shot, at least." Autumn took a deep breath, sat upright, and pulled out her stack of notes. "I've been trying to work everykirin's concerns into the new constitution, and that's going fine, I guess.

kirin.20.d_2:0 "Autumn Blaze crumpled up yet another piece of paper in her magic and turned it into ash with a little frustration channeled through her horn. She'd been stuck in her office all day, unable to get outside and enjoy some fresh air, all because she couldn't find the right way to word the draft of the bill in front of her. She was about to set it aside and try again later when the door to her study opened and a brown kirin stepped in with a fresh stack of papers for the Premier to look at. When the newcomer saw Autumn's exasperation, however, she paused in the doorway and frowned. "Autumn? Is this a bad time?"\n\nAutumn sighed and waved the kirin in. "No, Cinder Glow, it's not. I've just been beating my face against the table for Concord knows how many hours now, and I've gotten basically nowhere with this draft of our new constitution!" She let out a groan and slouched back in her seat. "This is nothing like writing up musicals back in Massicot!"\n\nCinder Glow bit her lip and stepped closer. "What's the problem, then?" she asked her premier and party leader. "Read it out to me. Maybe that will help you figure some things out."\n\n"Well, it's worth a shot, at least." Autumn took a deep breath, sat upright, and pulled out her stack of notes. "I've been trying to work everykirin's concerns into the new constitution, and that's going fine, I guess.

kirin.21.d_1:0 "It wasn't long before the first of the ancient ships breached the surface of the water, its crooked and splintered mast exposed to the winds of Fragrance for the first time in ninety years. Fickle Current watched as the salvage crews busily set to work securing the rotting wreck to tugboats and barges, ready to haul it into a nearby drydock for repairs and refitting. It was one of three early dreadnoughts that had formed the backbone of the Vermilion Armada before the Silence, and when it was scuttled along with its two sister ships, it had been one of the most advanced seafaring vessels in the world. Nowadays it would have been horrifically obsolete, of course, but some salvage and retrofitting would turn it into a serviceable, if outdated, foundation for a new Vermilion Armada.\n\nThe history of the ships was something that every foal of Fragrance knew well, and Current was no exception. The ships had taken part in the Armada mutinies after The Silence was passed, where the sailors of the Armada attempted to seize their old ships, mothballed for ten years by that point, and strike into the open waters as pirates, mercenaries, and smugglers; anything to provide for Fragrance's swiftly impoverished populace. Soldiers from Vermilion had suppressed the mutiny and retook most of the mothballed ships, immediately scuttling them to prevent a second mutiny. It was just another insult in a long list from the imperial capital, and the message it sent was crystal clear: Vermilion expected Fragrance to quietly huddle up and die, and any attempts the city made to save itself were treason. That humiliation stung deep, and the hateful lessons it had taught had simmered for a hundred years.\n\nBut today was a new day. Like the ships of the line returning from the murky depths of the harbor, Fragrance was beginning to return to yesteryear's glory. These ships, raised in Fragrance and launched from its drydocks, would be the first to safeguard Kiria's post-Silence maritime interests. Fragrance, just like them, was leading the way for a post-Silence Kiria. And one day, Fickle Current hoped, Fragrance and all of its children would be given the respect they deserved for everything they sacrificed for the Realm."

Rising Sun's sudden appearance made Fickle Current jump, and she leaned her forelegs across the harbor guardrail as her intelligent eyes took in the salvage operation. "It's like Fragrance is reborn. I bet the symbolism of raising those old ships to start our new navy is leaving you just dripping with pleasure."\n\n"What do you want, heretic?" Fickle Current asked her.\n\n"Heretic? I guess Winter Frost is rubbing off on you." She sweetly smiled at him. "You don't even believe in Concord and The Way of Fire, Current. I wouldn't try to strain yourself in keeping up appearances by calling me a heretic." She chuckled and turned her attention back to the ships. "Those ships were scuttled because the sailors forgot their place. They let their own self-interests overpower their obligations to The Way of Fire and their Matriarch. If you ask me, Fragrance was let off easy for letting it happen in the first place."\n\n"I didn't," Current shot back. "Your point?"\n\nRising Sun just shrugged and turned away, her tail darting out from under her robes to flick Current's ear. "I think it's just something to remember," she said as she walked away. "Because if something like that happens again, Fragrance and her foals aren't going to get a second chance.""

kirin.101.d_1:0 "The first sign of bad news was the piece of paper nailed to the door of the Morning Secretariat proclaiming that Concord has abandoned the Vermilion Realm. Below it, the signatures of two dozen reputable priests and mystics put a foreboding weight to the proclamation.\n\nThe second was the imperial courier that collapsed on the steps to the Vermilion palace, beaten and bloody. In her satchel were reports of violence between the returning diaspora, who saw themselves as superior to the local commoners, and the farmers and fisherkirin of the realm, who saw the returning émigrés as foreign colonizers trying to crush their way of life. The courier had to flee Fragrance as riots started, and had been accosted by both sides for merely trying to do her job. It was a small wonder she made it back to the capital alive.\n\nAfter that, bad news flowed like a monsoon, drowning the Morning Secretariat in dismay and grinding the Plenum to a halt.\n\nRain Shine could only listen hopelessly as her premier read out the latest chaos happening across the Realm. Cultural upheaval was everywhere and clashes between tradition and modernization were commonplace. The eastern coast, particularly the cities of Fragrance and Rhapsody, had practically turned into warzones between locals and the diaspora, with reports that nationalist paramilitaries had organized and orchestrated coups against the Matriarch's appointed governors, installing their leaders in their steads. But despite the chaos in the east, the populace their still paid lip service to Rain Shine as her subjects, unlike the west. There, in the rural and underdeveloped stretches of Kiria, the heretical sect of The Rising Fire had engaged in open rebellion against Rain Shine's rule. Clashes between imperial banners and local militias had put a dark mood over the Secretariat, and the situation only seemed to be growing more dire. And throughout it all, reports of nirik transformations and raging fires had come in from all across the nation. Kiria was dying.\n\nRain Shine excused herself from the Secretariat, having heard enough bad news for the day, and wandered the halls of her grand palace alone. She had done this to Kiria; she was the one responsible for this failure. She had tried to cram a century's worth of lost progress into three years of reform, and it had blown up in her face. She had created a dilemma worse than the one her mother faced, and now, for the first time, she understood why The Silence had been enacted at all. The kirin were simply not ready for the modern world.\n\nBut there was nothing she could do now. She had staked her authority on the success of the Plenum, and it had failed. Her decrees begging for the violence to end would fall on deaf ears. She had dug this grave for Kiria, and now it looked like she was about to lie in it with her Realm."

That spark was Rising Sun as she took the podium before her peers. "The east may have forgotten who they are, but the west stands firm," she proclaimed. "The Rising Fire supports our Matriarch, and so long as I have a seat on this Secretariat, we will support Kiria. But time is of the essence if we want to do this right. The Realm is fracturing, and nirik transformations are becoming more commonplace. If we don't right the ship now, even I won't be able to satisfy the demands for reform coming from the west. Kiria will be broken within a month if we don't do something to fix it, so we must. For the good of the realm."\n\nRain Shine silently nodded along as Rising Sun's words stirred up one last bit of resolve in the Secretariat. There was still a chance to save Kiria. They couldn't afford to waste it."

The teachings of The Way of Fire encourage friendly relations with one's neighbor and strongly discourage any thoughts and actions that could lead to a fall into the nirik state, helping to facilitate the construction of a functional kirin society. As part of its beliefs, all kirin owe complete devotion and reverence to the Matriarch Superior, their divine leader who unites with Concord's godly divinity upon her ascension, and whose will is interpreted and executed by a robust caste of priests and mystics scattered throughout the Realm. Defiance of the Matriarch's decrees is considered blasphemy against Concord Herself, and so the Matriarchs of Kiria rule with absolute theocratic authority. This is useful for keeping the populace in line with the Matriarch's desires, but less useful in facilitating the expression of new ideas."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_1:0 "I left Vermilion a few weeks ago to go visit the new steelworks that have been erected in Fragrance and Rhapsody, argued for and funded in large part by §YFickle Current§! and his like-minded business partners. I've traveled a little bit around the Realm as part of the job, and even a little bit before that when §YThe Silence§! still had our people locked in its grasp, but I've never been this far north. I thought all of our realm was like Vermilion or Massicot, either withering cities dwindling as they decayed, or small villages full of kirin trying to scratch out simple lives with no support or assistance from the government. But Fragrance and Rhapsody are nothing like that! They are still splendid cities, places that tried so very hard to resist the economic and societal collapses of The Silence, and managed to save some of our culture and way of life from before The Silence brought everything to a standstill. I don't know how better I could describe it. The kirin in these cities still have life and color in them, a sense of optimism that tomorrow is going to be a §Ybetter day.§! That's something I share with them, and it made me oh so happy to see it during my travels.\n\nOh, shoot, I'm getting off topic. Or am I? I don't know. Anyway, the §Ysteelworks§! that Fickle Current's clique funded are an amazing sight to behold. These aren't just workshops where blacksmiths forge steel and work their craft; this is something else entirely, a §Ymodern revolution§! that was smothered in Kiria a century ago, but was refined and perfected by the griffons of Griffonia and the ponies of Equus. These are entire factories filled with heavy machinery powered by electricity (another invention from over the seas; it makes me realize just how small my world was growing up in The Silence!) and guided along by workers who pull levers, hit buttons and somehow wrangle these machines into doing all the work for them. And the results can't even be compared to the work of smithy workshops and guilds; these factories can produce §Yin a day§! what an entire guild of talented blacksmiths can produce in a year! Sure, it loses some of that personal touch, but when we're trying to drag our entire nation into the modern era after a century of sitting on our hooves, this industrialization is practically a blessing sent by §YConcord§! herself. Current and his friends might be a little too cynical and greedy for my tastes, but the inventions they're bringing in from overseas, and the capital they're investing in setting up our industry, more than makes up for it. I can only hope that some of the fruits of their labor can make its way down to the ponies working in the steel mills; those I talked to said they worked §Yten or twelve hours a day§! in the scorching heat, with only a few breaks throughout the day. But it pays better than farming (so I've been told), and besides, we kirin like the heat anyway. It's a rough start for many of these workers, but I feel that given enough time and hardwork, this will all pay off for them like it will for the rest of us. We just have to believe in the future we're all building §Ytogether.§!\n\nI believe in that future, and in the Matriarch Superior, and in Concord's blessings. To some extent, I believe in Fickle Current and his compatriots too. We just have to work together to make the best use of the blessings Kiria has been given, and we can shape our future into anything we want it to be. And I'm going to do §Yeverything§! I can to help make it happen!"

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_2:0 "Reform, reform, reform! I don't know how many times I had to say that word during the first meeting of §YThe Reform Bureau§! (oh darn I just did it again!), but today was a very busy day! Since the Matriarch Superior made me the premier of the §YPlenum§! (I still don't know why she trusts me with that much responsibility), I was automatically made the head of the Reform Bureau, which is just basically a fancy way of saying I have to be responsible for getting all the influential delegates from the Plenum into one place where we can discuss the specifics of how we want to enact things that get passed on the debate floor. We are, essentially, the §Ycentral government§! of Kiria, and we act with a limited amount of imperial mandate that Rain Shine blessed us with. That's a lot of responsibility for a young mare from Massicot to handle, but I'll do my best to save the Realm and not let the Matriarch down!\n\nUnfortunately, trying to get everykirin to work together is like herding cats, and I've never had a pet cat before, let alone two or three or four, so I'm a little short on experience. §YFickle Current§! brought in a lot of his buddies from overseas, and though the capitalists are providing a lot of the capital and ideas we need to get this whole modernization thing moving, I feel like I have to stop them from reshaping Kiria to §Ysuit their interests§! over those of the common kirin. At least I have somewhat of an ally in that in §YPriestess Winter Frost§!, who is wary about how rapid modernization will alter the social fabric of the kirin species, but I often feel like she goes a little too far. If you try to suggest anything that changes the way kirin society functioned during The Silence, she usually §Ypushes back hard on it§!, afraid of how any hint of modernization could possibly weaken the influence of §YThe Way of Fire§! in our culture. I had to end up playing middlemare between the two and finding a §Ycompromise that helps out everykirin§!, but I don't know how much longer I can keep that up if Winter and Fickle don't get on the same page. It's exhausting! Oh, how I wish I had Applejack and Fluttershy here to help show us how to follow §Ythe Equestrian model of Harmony...§!\n\nBut I'm not going to give up, not at all. Even if it is exhausting and draining, I'm going to keep going back into the Bureau and doing my best to move things along for the good of all the Realm. Hopefully, as we keep working together, we'll be able to get everykirin to have fair and honest debates about how we're going to modernize the country. We all have a common goal, afterall. It falls on us to figure out how to get to it. I'm confident we'll find a way to make that happen!"

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_3:0 "§YI do not think that I am a good Premier.§!\n\nOh, how do I even begin? Today's assembly at the court was a complete and total disaster. In the midst of our bickering, a procession of kirin following the religious doctrine they call §YThe Rising Fire§! entered the court, led by a mare who calls herself Rising Sun, and asked to join in on the Plenum. I wanted to let them join, as every kirin should have a voice in determining §Ythe future of the Realm§!, but I let myself be bowled over by §YWinter Frost§! and §YFickle Current§!, who immediately opposed Rising Sun and her followers from joining in. Winter despises The Rising Fire, calling it and its followers §Yheretics§!, and I'm pretty sure she'd toss them all into the sea if she could. Current and his pals don't like the ideas of a §Ycommunalist society§!, because they feel it's a threat to the industry and capitalism they're trying to set up in the Realm. And me? I don't know what happened in court. I felt like I wasn't sure if letting Rising Sun and her followers join the Plenum was the right idea. §YEquestria§! once had a problem with ponies who had a similar mindset to Rising Sun and her sect, and it caused so much misery up there. Maybe I just didn't want the same thing to happen here in the Realm.\n\nBut Rising Sun and her followers are gone now. When I refused to welcome them to the Plenum, they were §Ychased out of the city§! by supporters of Fickle and Winter... and even some of my supporters as well. Instead of talking things out with Rising Sun, we refused to listen to what she had to say and used force to make her go away. And you know what scares me the most? Winter and Current were §Ymore than happy§! to use force to get what they wanted. I'm starting to think that not every debate and problem we're going to encounter at the Plenum can be solved with §Ywords and compromise§!. Force of will and personality (and, I hope, only those two kinds of force) will be what drags this Plenum across the finish line. I don't know if I have the mettle to stand up to Current and Frost when it counts. If I did, maybe I would have made sure that Rising Sun and her delegation had a seat at the Plenum to contribute ideas for the revitalization of our nation.\n\n§YThings are going badly§!, I feel, and this whole ordeal is turning out to be less fulfilling and uplifting than I thought it was going to be when I agreed to be the Matriarch's premier at the start of it all. But it's too late to back out of this now or feel sorry for myself. I have to push on and keep doing my job, no matter what it takes. §YAll of Kiria depends on it.§!"

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_2_entry_1:0 "Praise be to Concord that in Her divine wisdom, She has seen fit to end The Silence that has blanketed our realm for too long. The kirin people have had §Yone hundred years§! to repent and reflect on the sins of modernization that nearly undid all the hard work of The Way of Fire in unifying our scattered and quarrelsome race centuries ago, and I feel that our society and culture has learned a great deal from the experience. Concord imparted Her will to punish Her errant children through §YMatriarch Noctilucent Charm§!, and now She has decided to forgive us through §YMatriarch Rain Shine§!. Now the only question is this: did we learn our lesson the first time?\n\nDuring Matriarch Charm's reign, §Yunchecked and unfettered modernization§! nearly collapsed our society, as the hedonism of modern conveniences turned our society away from the simple truths of The Way of Fire. We, our parents, our grandparents, and even our great grandparents have atoned for these mistakes. Traditionalist as I am, and naturally wary of any change that could undermine Concord's divine authority in our lives, I nevertheless believe that we can safely bring the Realm out of The Silence and into the modern era through careful reflection and consideration of how our choices align with Concord's will. We cannot be willing to blindly turn our faith from our Matriarch to enlightenment and luxury, for then we lose sight of Concord's vision. Foreigners like Fickle Current and his capitalists have been born and raised without Concord's guidance in their lives; they are no followers of The Way of Fire, and they should not be allowed to dictate the future of kirin society. But their money and innovations can serve Kiria in Her vision all the same. One example is the §Yexpansion of roads§! that many of my fellow priests and mystics have volunteered to organize and lead. All across the Realm, my fellow spiritual leaders are recruiting peasants from the fields to repair and renew the roads linking the Realm together, roads that have long fallen into disrepair and disuse throughout The Silence. It is important work that needs to be done, and this modernization will allow us to once again §Yreassert Concord's will§! across the Realm. It is a truly noble project, and just one of many ways we can use the tools of the modern time to reinforce our tradition and our heritage.\n\nBut such a venture also comes with its own risks. The disconnectedness of The Silence was a test placed by Concord to measure our devotion and reward our faith in Her. But now that we are reconnecting the realm, it is clear that some have failed the test. §YHotbeds of heresy§! have sprung up in the west, even in cities such as Verdant and Chrysanthemum, where the mystics and their followers have turned away from The Way of Fire to adopt their own set of heretical beliefs. Connecting Vermilion to these cities is not a one way street; just as they allow the Matriarch to reassert her authority over the west, they allow the heretics to spread their lies and falsehoods further into the east. Such heresy is §Yunacceptable§!, and I will do everything in my power to stamp it out before its corruption can ensnare Vermilion. Such is Concord's will, and as one of Her priestesses, I am Her instrument. I will not fail my Goddess, nor will I fail my Matriarch. I will be the voice of tradition and heritage that Kiria needs me to be, for the good of the Realm."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_2_entry_2:0 "Concord, my Goddess, if You have seen fit to challenge me in such a way, please lend me the strength to pass Your test.\n\n§YThe Way of Fire§! is beset by heretics and traitors at every corner. Today, Fickle Current and his cronies orchestrated a takeover of the government through paper and honeyed words. They stole the divine authority that Concord blesses our Matriarchs with for themselves, turning the Morning Secretariat into the central governing body of the Realm, and removing Matriarch Rain Shine's ability to rule by imperial decree, as has been done in the Realm for centuries. All of this was done under the pretense of codifying laws and political power, but it is nothing more than attempting to put the rule of mortals over the §Ydivine will of Concord§!. The Realm is slowly losing the religious foundations that made it so wonderful and stable, and nokirin outside of my followers seems to care. We were a squabbling mess of petty tribes and villages before The Way of Fire saved us all. What is to stop us from returning to this dreadful way of life should we forget the importance of its five tenets?\n\nIn time, I believe the kirin of Kiria will see the truth of what Fickle Current and his allies are: corrupt and godless businesskirin §Yonly in it for themselves§!. The people of Kiria will stop them from turning the Realm into their plaything, of that, I am sure. But what I am less sure about is the subversive activities of the heretic, §YRising Sun§!. From the moment she entered Vermilion, I knew that she had but one goal on her mind: to destroy The Way of Fire and replace it with her own heresy that she calls §YThe Rising Fire§!. She and her misguided followers believe that their individual communities share a deeper connection with Concord than our divine Matriarch, that the word of the Goddess Herself can be deciphered by the common kirin instead of needing the interpretation of educated and trained priests and scholars. Though she did her best to hide it today, I am sure that this harlot sees the weakening of our Matriarch's authority as a blessing, a way to weaken the righteous grasp of The Way of Fire over the Realm, allowing her to spread her heresy far and wide.\n\nWhat concerns me most about Rising Fire is her §Ycunning§!. Any sensible and respectable kirin would immediately denounce heresy against Concord, but Rising Sun has managed to trick countless thousands of kirin into following her beliefs. Her mind is sharp, her tongue quick, and her eyes seem to see everything at once. I have seen her work at the Plenum ever since our §Yhopeless Premier§! mistakenly saw fit to allow her delegation to participate. She is shrewd and cunning, and plays off of the other delegations to get what she wants. She pretends to support The Way of Fire and the Matriarch when it is convenient, and abandons them when it is not. All the while, her supporters campaign in the city, ever-deepening their entrenchment in the capital of the Realm. Were that I had the power of the first Matriarch, §YIridescent Dawn§!, who could subdue foes with her words and whose talents of theology and rhetoric were unmatched in all the Realm, who could talk a nirik out of their rage when all other methods fail. Were that I could use her skills to dismantle this heretic sect on the Plenum floor, to make the rest of the Realm see how close we are to falling to heresy. Every second that we entertain The Rising Fire is another moment it has to strengthen its position. Something has to be done sooner rather than later. Otherwise, §Yall is lost§!."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_3_entry_1:0 "It is still surreal to me that I am now living in my ancestral homeland. I may have been born in Skyfall and spent the better part of 54 years of my life in Griffonia and Equus, but §YKiria§! has always tugged at my heart from afar. I grew up hearing stories from my grandfather about the country he left behind and the family he had to say goodbye to, and though those memories are tinted rose with the passage of time, the stories he told were not happy ones. §YThe Silence§! destroyed his successful trading company and uprooted so many kirin like him, kirin who fled across the world to find a better life than the life the Matriarch and The Way of Fire forced upon them at home. Those who did not flee were left destitute in the apocalyptic aftermath of economic suicide; who knows how many relatives my family once had who have faded into §Yobscurity and squalor§! because they could not flee to Griffonia like my grandfather did? I have thought many times about reconnecting with distant relatives who spent their entire lives living in The Silence instead of abroad, but always decided against it. What family I have lived in Griffonia with me, not in Kiria, and those that lived here would only be asking for handouts from a §Ysuccessful businesskirin§! who made his fortune in more opportune places.\n\nBut now that I have returned to Kiria, there is much work to be done. Foremost among these tasks is bringing back §Ythe diaspora§! and making sure that their voices will be heard in the reconstruction of our nation. Kiria is hopeless without her foals educated abroad, foals who have gone on to be successful capitalists, industrialists, scientists, inventors, entrepreneurs, and more in nations that appreciated their talents. From the moment I arrived in Kiria, I have spent as much time as I can afford trying to reach out to the diaspora and §Ybring them home§!, and my labors have thus far borne many fruits. Just last night, I concluded a party in Fragrance where I brushed shoulders and exchanged words and promises with many of these lost sons and daughters of Kiria. In exchange for their financial support, I promised them §Ylucrative contracts§! and business deals in the resurgent Realm to make their time and money worth the investment. I have indebted myself under a mountain of favors, but like any good businesscreature, I am good at finding ways to get others to foot the bill. §YMatriarch Rain Shine§! and the rest of the government will make excellent patrons to exchange these favors with; after all, everything I do for the Realm benefits them greatly.\n\nSoon, my vision, and the vision of the Realm's lost foals, will emerge triumphant over this period of reform. We are all organized, disciplined, connected, and funded in a way that no other kirin in this Realm is, even our Matriarch. We will be Kiria's saviors, and as such, we will make sure that we are amply rewarded... §Ywhen the time comes§!."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_3_entry_2:0 "It pleases me to see the progress we've made in modernizing the Realm when we have the right kirin to guide the process. Our latest victory was the §YCharter of Rights§! that I saw passed through the Plenum. Kiria's legal system was a mess, but what is to be expected of a §Yhopeless theocracy§!? The nation was held together by hundreds if not thousands of vague religious rulings and conflicting interpretations of Concord's divine will. This made it very hard for any enterprising kirin to maneuver in the system; what one mystic thinks is acceptable may be completely unacceptable to another, and in disputes such as these, mystics and priests immediately defer to their higher authority without question. In most cases, that ends up being the §YMatriarch Superior§!, giving her ultimate decision making authority over the Realm. But now with the Charter of Rights passed, §YThe Way of Fire§! no longer holds such absolute authority over the land. The Charter is a single codified document free of confusing and vague religious statutes that explicitly lays down the word of law. Of course, I made sure that such a Charter was not §Ytoo restricting§! in its legalese. There is space to maneuver, semantics to exploit, and technicalities to find, all perfectly legal within the law for a kirin clever enough to find them. I even managed to score crucial victories for §Yprivate property rights§!, freeing much of a kirin's wealth and assets from mandatory tithes to The Way of Fire, a useless tax that would cripple investments and incentives for any business trying to operate in the Realm. This has been, undeniably, a win for §Ycapitalism§!, and the future of Kiria is looking bright.\n\nBut there is always room to improve. A good businesskirin will not settle for reducing their taxes to 20%, when they could instead be 15% with enough pushing and prodding. Despite the influence I wielded over the Charter, §YPremier Autumn Blaze§! and her allies still managed to include provisions for labor rights and civic freedoms. These are the sort of things that are good to have in a developed nation where they can be afforded, but Kiria is not a developed nation. We are poor and agrarian, and these reforms §Ystand in the way of progress§!. But at any rate, I only see them as temporary obstacles. Autumn is hopelessly outclassed by her job, and I cannot help but feel sorry for the poor mare. She is young and clueless to how the world works; she only earned the position because Matriarch Rain Shine feels §Yindebted§! to her for some reason. I fully expect her support to evaporate as she continues to blunder her way through the Plenum, and when that happens, I have enough support to replace her as the §Ynext premier§!. I'd do a much better job than her; that is something everykirin can agree with. And that also affords me the opportunity to make a few changes that benefit those who have given the most for the modernization of the Realm. I know many partners and connections who would benefit greatly if those labor rights were §Yremoved§! from the Charter, for instance..."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_3_entry_3:0 "Today, my friends in Fragrance Shipyards and myself met with the Equestrian delegation over the transfer of §Yship schematics§! and blueprints into our hooves. While the designs of the ships they gave us were outdated by their standards, and the fire control systems and battery schematics were similarly antiquated to the modern world, they obsolete the three ships we raised from Fragrance's harbor to the point where they'd only serve well as training dummies. But this transfer of knowledge wouldn't even be possible without the efforts of our §Ymisguided premier§! in befriending the Equestrians. Even though she may be hopelessly outclassed by the requirements of her job, even a broken clock is right twice a day, as they say. The deal is not perfect, of course; in exchange for these blueprints and schematics, we had to agree to give Equestria §Yprospecting rights§! for any resources that they find in Kiria, so in exchange for a one-time gift of obsolete knowledge, they earned themselves a steady stream of valuable raw materials to siphon out of our nation. This won't hurt us in the short term, as Kiria is so underdeveloped and improperly exploited that we do not have a lot of resources immediately on hoof for delivery. In essence, we're only exchanging a small fraction of an already pitifully small potential in this deal. But we will be stung in the §Ylong term§! if we do not find a way to renegotiate or renege on the deal as we properly exploit the resources of our lands. Equestria will gain an ever-growing share of our material output, sapping us of what should be ours by right.\n\nWhile the deal itself went off without any complications, I had an unfortunate encounter with the delegate by the name of §YApplejack§!, one of Autumn Blaze's friends and supposedly a member of the so-called §YElements of Harmony§!. I think she was supposed to represent Honesty if I recall correctly, which is a useful trait to have when negotiating a business deal, though I did not care all that much to properly commit it to memory. Magic artifacts are useful tools but their importance is increasingly diminishing in a modern era of technology and science. At any rate, the mare pulled me aside after the meaning and tried to give me a lecture about §Yproper cooperation§! with the other leaders of the Plenum. And though she did not outright say it, she implicitly accused me of using the Plenum for the benefit of my friends and myself over the benefit of the Realm. While she is correct that the path of modernization I wish to take Kiria on does directly benefit the returning diaspora like myself, it also stands to greatly benefit the Realm as a whole, and cooperation with my colleagues only comes when they meet me halfway. It is not fair for one party to bend over backwards to please an uncompromising partner, after all. I did try to explain this to her, but the mare must be part donkey—that would explain her stubbornness, at least. It seems that the only system she's willing to accept and understand is one that directly mimics the §YEquestrian model of Harmony§!, and anything else is completely foreign to her. Now, at least, I understand where Autumn Blaze learned her hopeless idealism from.\n\nProper cooperation with my peers does still remain an elusive ideal, I will admit, and not one that I can easily reach. Many of the ideas of the other cliques are §Ysimply incompatible§! with a modern Kiria, particularly the traditionalist nonsense that priestess Winter Frost spouts out during every session of the Plenum. I cannot afford to compromise with her too much, else I will lose the backing of my followers and supporters. They wish to see a §Yproperly modernized§! Kiria, not one laden with the burden of outdated religious philosophy, and if I am perceived to be too weak, then I will be ousted as the NAKP's leader. Even in this, life is like a business, and an incapable executive must be replaced for the good of the company. Only in this case, the company is the country, and it cannot have a weak executive board if it is to prosper and be profitable. I will have to be careful to find the right balance between §Ycompromise and dissent§! if I am to steer the fortunes of both Kiria and myself to a more profitable tomorrow."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_4_entry_1:0 "There is perhaps nothing quite so refreshing and relaxing as traveling the roads of our splendid nation—especially when those roads are §Yfreshly laid§!, no less.\n\nIt is a humbling experience that truly brings one closer to Concord, and it is a communion that can be shared with one's company and the kirin that she crosses paths with along the way. My fellow mystics and I have spent the past several weeks traveling along the new roads laid down in the §Yrural west§! of our realm, spreading the glorious news about §YThe Rising Fire§! and how we must adapt the tenets of Concord's faith to a new day. The Silence has taught all of us who follow The Rising Fire important lessons; namely, that we do not need a pyramidal religious order to understand her intentions, that we do not need the temptations of the modern age that turn us away from her glory, that we do not need the legal codes and shackles of some foreigner's ideas of governance to run our nation in defiance of Concord's will. Verdant and Chrysanthemum §Ythrived§! during The Silence, because we learned how to properly interpret and adapt Concord's intentions to the century of communal isolation that it bestowed on the realm. Common kirin organized in their communities, each finding their own meaning in Concord's creations, and working together for a truly classless and equal society can do more good for Kiria than §YThe Way of Fire§! ever could in the modern era. The doctrines of yesteryear belong in yesteryear, and they must modernize too along with the times if they are to hold sway in the future we proudly strive towards.\n\nWe have spread the news and beliefs of our doctrine to §Ycountless kirin§! on the roads we have traveled, and we have been repaid amply in the kindness of strangers and even by the government officials of our Matriarch Superior. Wherever we travel, somekirin is willing to offer us a place to stay for the night and a warm meal, as it is well known that to treat one of Concord's priests with kindness §Yinvites her blessings upon your household§!. And government officials give us alms and gifts, encouraging us to continue to spread the word about the end of The Silence and motivate the populace to rejoice. Though most do so perhaps mistakenly; they believe that we are priests of the old tenets of The Way of Fire, not mystics of The Rising Fire, and doubtless we would get into heated confrontations with them if they knew the truth; most officials from Vermilion I have gotten to know are §Yfairly dogmatic§! in their old beliefs, and would not react well to anykirin professing something some would see as §Yheretical§!. But what they do not know will not harm them, and it will make our lives easier as we continue to spread the word.\n\nWe have enlightened many converts today, just as we did the day before, and as we will continue to do tomorrow. We are the §Yforefront of a movement§!, the tip of the spear, and the fruits of our labor will one day be sweet to savor. Until then, we must do our best to make sure Concord's true divine will is heard throughout the nation."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_4_entry_2:0 "The wonders of modern technology are truly a blessing from Concord. Where once we roamed from town to town and village to village by hoof, the advent of modern transportation in the form of §Ythe railroad§! has greatly aided us in spreading the beliefs of The Rising Fire to the kirin of the realm. We can visit several towns in a day, whereas before we could only visit one town in several days, stopping at inns or farms along the road and speaking to only a hoofful of kirin before moving on. With such an efficient vector for proselytisation as the railroad, the Rising Fire is spreading §Yfaster than ever§!, and more and more kirin in more and more towns are finding the truth in our teachings. This is truly one of the greatest boons our movement has ever seen, and proves that modernization and The Rising Fire are made for each other.\n\nWhen night falls and the day's tracklaying has ceased, miniature shantytowns spring up at the end of the line. They are populated by an §Yentirely new class§! of kirin who are more than eager to embrace The Rising Fire. On any given day, I speak to tracklayers, coal miners, mechanics, and even sex workers who populate these transient railside camps. Many are pleased to have a job free of the dull monotony of farming and fishing, but they also feel §Yinadequately rewarded§! for the services they provide by the foreign businesskirin who employ them. The work they do is backbreaking and dangerous, and yet they barely earn more than farmers and fishers do for their labors. The Way of Fire does not care for them, and would rather that they §Ynot exist at all§!, as the traditionalist mystics and priests are wary of the new developments happening in the Realm. But §YThe Rising Fire supports them§!; they provide important labor for their communities, and in the eyes of Concord, they are favored by her divine blessing. Under our teachings and guidance, they are helping to build communities that will appreciate their work and reward them amply. We will do what the leaders of the realm will not do: acknowledge them, recognize their troubles, and treat them as equals. Such is Concord's will, and such is my purpose on this earth. As her faithful servant, I will not rest until §Yher will is fully realized.§!"

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_4_entry_3:0 "As of late, I've spent less time traveling the roads than I have staying in one place and writing letters. It is a queer transition and one that I'm not used to, but it is proving to be more effective. Since the §YTransmission Office§! was opened to receive petitions from kirin all across the realm, my followers and I have spent our time writing letters on behalf of the common kirin throughout the Realm, acting as their representatives to petition the Matriarch Superior through the office. It is a change that benefits the common kirin more than their leaders at the §YPlenum§! would believe. The Office of Transmission is designed to serve as a direct interface for the Matriarch to hear from her subjects when they cannot make the journey to Vermilion to petition her in person, but a large portion of our nation is still §Yilliterate§!, meaning it is useless to them. My fellow mystics and I are all literate by our training and education, and so we visit these kirin, put their complaints and desires onto paper for them, and make sure that they are received by the §YMatriarch herself§!.\n\nThis has been a great boon to the commoners, as otherwise, they lack the necessary influence to make their voices heard, especially by the leaders of the Plenum. Priestess Winter Frost is insular and myopic, and sees any kirin speaking out about how The Way of Fire has failed them as §Yheretic rabble to be ignored§!. Fickle Current is indifferent; he is foreign-born and foreign-educated, and sees himself above the afflictions and desires of the commoners, viewing them only as §Ytools to be used§! for his own personal gain. And Premier Autumn Blaze, though well-intentioned and caring, is naive and inexperienced, and simply §Ylacks the awareness and knowhow§! to address this problem. The harsh realities of modernization are leaving us common kirin behind, and so somekirin must serve as their herald and their champion. Just as I have always faithfully served §YConcord§!, so too shall I serve §Ythe poor and downtrodden§! of Kiria. And as they realize their voices are being heard and their complaints are being addressed, the common kirin of the Realm will remember who listened to them and who fought on their behalf, and they will remember that it was The Rising Fire that saved them—not §The Way of Fire§!."

KIR_rain_shine_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 2 April 945 in Vermilion\n\n§YBiography:§!: Matriarch Superior Rain Shine has lived her entire life upholding the imperial decrees that instituted the societal and cultural stagnation and decay of the Realm of Kiria, and never once did she imagine that she would be the kirin to undo them. The decrees had been issued by her mother, Matriarch Superior Noctilucent Charm, in 902, and when she passed in 971, Rain Shine swore upon her ascension pyre that she would maintain her mother's policies and devote her life to studying the Way of Fire and the teachings of the fire goddess, Concord, to protect Kiria.\n\nHowever, in 1006, an unexpected diplomatic mission from Equestria ventured into the isolated nation and reached Rain Shine's court in Vermilion. There, two bearers of the Elements of Harmony, Fluttershy and Applejack, argued that they had seen kirin living in poverty and squalor all throughout the realm as a result of The Silence, and while it was effective in preventing nirik transformations, it needed to end for the good of all kirinkind. They offered Equestrian aid in getting the nation back on its hooves, and Rain Shine, isolated from her subjects in the royal palace and oblivious to their plights, realized that continuing The Silence would only spell doom for her subjects in the long run. Though she had sworn to uphold her mother's policies, once Rain Shine learned of the terrible cost The Silence had on the people of Kiria, she agreed to repeal her mother's decrees and end it once and for all.\n\nNow, with The Silence ending in Kiria, Rain Shine has pledged to make up for her mother's mistakes and bring the kirin species into the modern age. But after 60 years of seclusion in Vermilion, Rain Shine may find that her authority is nowhere near as strong as her mother's was a century ago.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! Twotail813"
