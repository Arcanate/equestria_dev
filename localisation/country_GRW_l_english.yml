#### Focuses ####
PRY_militia:0 "Riase more Militia"
PRY_militia_desc:0 "Still the royalist scum stubbornly resist, but the hearts and minds of the Griffonian peasantry is ours. We will form more militia brigades and turn to tide of the war in our favour."

PRY_firing_ranges:0 "Fields to Firing Ranges"
PRY_firing_ranges_desc:0 "As long as this civil war has lasted, we still have no organised structure for recruiting and training new troops. General Wilta Gryphon, recently promoted out of the KDSF 2nd Regiment, has laid out plans to turn the massive amount of abandoned farmland we have at our disposal into training grounds."
PRY_CE_firing_ranges:0 "§M KDSF influence will increase after Wilta and the democrats display their practicality and ingenuity §!" 

PRY_faith_GLA:0 "Faith in the GLA"
PRY_faith_GLA_desc:0 "We may have the hearts and minds of the Griffonian peasantry, but that means little when their bodies and guns are spread so thinly across the nation. Richard Spear has proposed that we would be more effective 'fighting one war than a thousand' and believes that centralising the war effort under the oversight of the GLA office corps is the only way to win this war"
PRY_CE_faith_GLA:0 "This will assemble 2 poorly trained but fully equiped 20 width infantry divisions with artillery support in White Flower. §M GLA influence will increase as the army is centralised under Redglads officer corps. §!"

PRY_partisans:0 "The Partisan Approach"
PRY_partisans_desc:0 "When asked 'how will we win this war' Union Speaker Theresa responds the same thing she always does 'we already have, the royalists just don't know it yet'. As the war drew on the RFU's connections have only grown, if the Union Speakers are to be believed we have an entire army working behind enemy lines, they just need a bit of encouragement to do some 'real fighting'"
PRY_CE_Partisans:0 "This will assemble 6 experienced 4 width partisan divisions in what was royalist territory at the start of 1007. §M RFU influence will increase as the army becomes more decrentralised. §!"

PRY_knife_in_the_back:0 "The Knife In The Back"
PRY_knife_in_The_back_desc:0"The treacherous griffs of Blackrock mountain have decended upon our exposed western flank, causing havoc amongst our undefended supply lines. We need to form a defence and fast."

PRY_new_guns:0 "The Weapon of the New Millenium"
PRY_new_guns_desc:0 "In todays age of armored vehicles and machineguns, the muzzled-loading musket is a woefully outdated weapon. General Koldvin has been trying to get his new rifle designs into production since before he joined us. If we put the full indusdry of the GLA behind the guns we could give him the chance."

PRY_making_guns:0 "Ricefield Armouries"
PRY_making_guns_desc:0 "We have a new pattern of weapon and a hundred or so prototypes to prove their effectivness, however we still need to get them in the claws of our griffs on the frontlines. Thankfully Koldvin's simple design requires very little machining, and so by providing them with the simple tools needed we can have comrades across the nation producing these rifles for us in their own homes."

PRY_victory:0 "Out with the Old"
PRY_victory_desc:0 "The last of the royalist forces that haven't lain down their weapons have gone into hiding. The Tyrant Kloseu De Kissau is in our custody. Redguard patrol the streets and trails unopposed. Victory is finally ours, the Comrade-General prepares for a speech in Kivessin to declare it."

#### Events ####
pry.1.t:0 "Militia"
pry.1.d:0 "After our recent surge in recruitment, new militia regiments have been formed and are awaiting orders."
pry.1.a:0 "To the front brothers!"

pry.2.t:0 "Training Fields Completed"
pry.2.d:0 "Witia's plan worked, with relativly minimal effort we've set up mass firing ranges and training regimes in the now abandoned ricefields that sprawl across the countryside. Before we were reliant on griffs who already knew how to fight or were brave enough to join the revolution regardless, now we have the infrastructure to start training new waves of troops."
pry.2.a:0 "Train quickly comrades"

pry.3.t:0 "Spear does it again!"
pry.3.d:0 "After sending officers to the various scattered strongholds and arms makers of the revolution, we've found that we had several groups working on making artillery brigades. Sadly resources and griffpower were spread so thin that few of these endevours would have seen fruit. However with some oversight from the GLA we've managed to funnel these projects into creating two fully equiped 'New Model Guard' regiments. Consisting of over 10000 infantrygriffs and supported by artillery high command hopes these regiments will serve as a template for the GLA going forward."
pry.3.a:0 "Glory to the new protectors of the revolution!"

pry.4.t:0 "Operation Check"
pry.4.d:0 "Clearly our messengers made it. After over a month of midnight meetings, secret weapons caches and smuggled battle plans our comrades are finally ready to move. Partisans formerly 'working' in Kivessin, Sydia, Crowoia and the rice farms of the Brofeld region are all rising up in arms  "
pry.4.a:0 "Checkmate, bourgeoisie"

pry.5.t:0 "Liberation Day"
pry.5.d:0 "TOBEWRITTEN"
pry.5.a:0 "TOBEWRITTEN"

pry.6.t:0 "GLA Dominate Politics"
pry.6.d:0 "Due to the Comrade-General favouring the ideas of the GLA's high command, their influence over the political sphere has increased to the point that most goverment jobs are preformed by griffs who hold rank in the GLA, or have connections to those who do."
pry.6.a:0 "Glory to the Comrade-General"

pry.7.t:0 "KDSF Dominate Politics"
pry.7.d:0 "Due to the Comrade-General favouring the ideas of the KDSF's political minds, their influence over the political sphere has increased to the point that the intellectual elite of Kivissin and their foreign experts have a hand in almost all goverment procedures. "
pry.7.a:0 "Glory to the Revolution"

pry.8.t:0 "RFU Dominate Politics"
pry.8.d:0 "Due to the Comrade-General favouring the ideas of the RFU's union speakers, their influence over the political sphere has increased to the point that many regions and communities are operating on a system of partial self-governance."
pry.8.a:0 "Glory to the People"

pry.9.t:0 "The Unstable Politics of the Revolution"
pry.9.d:0 "The revolutinaries are united against the King and all agree on redistributing the wealth that the Nobility have hoarded for so long. That's about all they agree on. A plethora of radical ideas and crackpot schemes for utopian goverments are invented daily by the revolutinaries of the GLA. That's not even mentioning the villages, communities and sometimes regions that have already started to build systems of self governance. Speaking for many of these regions is the Rice Farmers Union, the failed collective bargening tool turned political entity who's communication networks are currently holding the revolution together. However any idea of a non-centralised state is strongly opposed by both the political thinkers of the KDSF and the military officers of the GLA, most of which are influential veterans of the revolution. Not that those groups get along either. The officer corps often see much of the democratic processed beurocracy as slowing down the goals of the revolution and leaving them weaker for it. The democrats on the other hand deeming much of the officer corps just as tryanical as the royalists they fight to replace. /n The politics of stand on a knife's edge, every decision the Comrade-General makes shifting the balance. "
pry.9.a:0 "I'll have to keep that in mind."

pry.10.t:0 "Politics remain undecided"
pry.10.d:0 "The Comrade-General hasn't favoured any of the three revolutinary factions. The brilliant minds of the KDSF plot grand schemes to optimise the nation along the lines of foreign models and theoretical fancies but lack the power to implement any of them. While the officers of the GLA struggle against beurocracatic red tape and curse the senseless eggheads who designed such systems. Meanwhile the RFU's union speakers struggle to cover up and protect the hidden communities and isolated backwaters that refuse to follow any law but their own. Once again we stand on the knife's edge"
pry.10.a:0 "Glory to...     somebody?"

#### Ideas ####
PRY_prywhen_civil_war:0 "Prywhen Civil War"
PRY_prywhen_civil_war_desc:0 "The Prywhen Civil War has been raging for quite a while now, and it has taken a toll on every griffon involved. The longer the conflict carries on, the heavier the toll on our nation and people becomes." 

PRY_education:0 "Military Education Effort"
PRY_education_desc:0 "As the civil war raged on we've made an effort to educate those involved with our military as having illiterate troops was making communication difficult. This has also improved the general literacy of the nation."

PRY_war_of_liberation:0 "War of Liberation"
PRY_war_of_liberation_desc:0 "We will cast out the monarchist scum and liberate our people from their bourgeoisie oppression!"

PRY_agricultrual_troubles:0 "Agricultrual Troubles"
PRY_agricultrual_troubles_desc:0 "With the civil war only worsening our lingering agricultrual issues, mass starvation is an ever present risk."

PRY_GLA_in_power:0 "GLA Influence"
PRY_GLA_in_power_desc:0 "Military control over much of the government has lead to record levels of productivity and the direct control over public transportation allows for faster troop movement. Our Officers always get their way. "

PRY_dems_in_power:0 "KDSF Influence"
PRY_dems_in_power_desc:0 "With foreign specialists and eccentric intellectuals overseeing our factories and farms, there's been a marked increase in efficiency and innovation. "

PRY_communes_in_power:0 "RFU Influence"
PRY_communes_in_power_desc:0 "The effective self-governance afforded to much of the nation has increased synpathy for the state and the GLA leading the much higher numbers of volunteers. Griffs that are willing to bleed our enemies for every inch of land they take."
