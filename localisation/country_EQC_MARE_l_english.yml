 ### FOCUSES ###
 EQC_seize_the_opportunity:0 "Entrench The Revolution"
 EQC_seize_the_opportunity_desc:0 "We have successfully overthrown the corrupt and capitalist regime of the old, but our grasp of the nation is tenuous at best. Reforms must begin which will restore order and ensure our total control of all."
 
 EQC_the_purge:0 "The Great Purge"
 EQC_the_purge_desc:0 "No one can be trusted. Not even those within the Party. We must vaporize those who could threaten the revolution before they cause any issues: The celestial loyalists, the capitalists and those who are too intelligent. Any mentions of their names will be removed from all records. It will be like they never existed in the first place."
 
 EQC_seize_the_ecomony:0 "Collectivize the Economy"
 EQC_seize_the_ecomony_desc:0 "The markets are our markets. We must uproot capitalism from our nation and burn it to ashes. Foreign trade must end too; any interaction with those outside our nation will be punishable by death. We can't have any influences entering the minds of our citizens that isn't strictly authorised by the state itself."
 
 EQC_reclass_the_population:0 "Reclass the Population"
 EQC_reclass_the_population_desc:0 "All societies across the world, throughout history, have been divided into three groups: The High, the Middle, and the Low. Our society, too, will have such a structure. The Inner Party will be the High, the Outer Party will be the Middle, and the Proletariat will be the Low. This new meritocratic order must be entrenched permanently."
 
 EQC_begin_mind_control:0 "Big Sister Is Watching You"
 EQC_begin_mind_control_desc:0 "To embody the Party and its values, an individual is needed. This person will be the public face of the Party, for emotions of love and fear are more easily focused on a single relatable pony. Her face will soon be displayed across the nation, with posters plastered on every wall with the slogan "Big Sister is Watching You.""
 
 EQC_MARE_goldhoofs_betrayal:0 "Goldshoof's Betrayal"
 EQC_MARE_goldhoofs_betrayal_desc:0 "Goldshoof, a once renowned revolutionary member, is now a double crossing traitor. No one remembers much of him during the revolution though he'll be remembered much after the revolution as his face has been plastered along the walls for everyone to see."
 
 #Ministry of Truth#
 EQC_found_minitrue:0 "Ignorance Is Strength"
 EQC_found_minitrue_desc:0 "Who controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past. As long as the Party retains control of the past, the truth is whatever the Party wants it to be. Those who stand against the Party and dispute the truth are heretics, and all traces of them have to be erased. They will never have existed."
 
 EQC_alter_the_past:0 "Alter The Past"
 EQC_alter_the_past_desc:0 "Marelandia has always been called Marelandia. It was never a colony. There is no place called "Mareland" in the world. We have always been at war with Equestria. All this is truth, and everything that contradicts truth must be rectified or erased. The Party is infallible."
 
 #Control#
 EQC_found_miniluv:0 "Freedom Is Slavery"
 EQC_found_miniluv_desc:0 "Power is in tearing minds to pieces and putting them back together in new shapes of your own choosing. Ponies of Marelandia will not know the "magic" of friendship, nor will they know honesty, generosity or kindness. They will only know love of Big Sister. We shall squeeze them empty of harmony, and fill them with ourselves."
 
 EQC_MARE_thought_police:0 "Thought Police"
 EQC_MARE_thought_police_desc:0 "Laying out any rebellion of any kind as treachery against not only Society, but their fellow Society member, and squashing it with the full force of MARESOC law will keep said thoughts locked away, and obedience paramount."
 
 EQC_MARE_three_classes:0 "The Three Classes"
 EQC_MARE_three_classes_desc:0 "The three classes of MARESOC Society: The Inner Party, those who are within the government itself. The Outer Party, those who work for the Party, but are not within it entirely, and then everyone else. No one, pony, zebra, nor griffon, are above another when it comes to the masses."
 
 EQC_MARE_telescreens:0 "Telescreens"
 EQC_MARE_telescreens_desc:0 "A moving picture on a screen, projected by a cathode ray tube, will not only keep the masses entertained, but if we curate what forms of culture they view, can give us control over what they hold to be true."
 
 EQC_MARE_big_sister_loves_you:0 "Big Sister Is Watching You"
 EQC_MARE_big_sister_loves_you_desc:0 "Reminding everyone that Big Sister is always there, watching over them (but more importantly, watching them) should help curb any rebellion."
 
 EQC_MARE_bread_and_circuses:0 "Bread and Circuses"
 EQC_MARE_bread_and_circuses_desc:0 "Food for all, and entertainment. Not only will this keep the masses appeased, but it'll keep them occupied when they aren't working for the betterment of Society. Controlling and thinking only of the present."
 
 EQC_MARE_controled_poverty:0 "Planned Poverty"
 EQC_MARE_controled_poverty_desc:0 "If everyone is poor, then logically no one is poor, and thus the economy of the former Jet Set can recover."
 
 #MiniPlenty#
 EQC_MARE_found_miniplenty:0 "Poverty Is Prosperity"
 EQC_MARE_found_miniplenty_desc:0 "The Ministry of Plenty, the Ministry responsible not only for agriculture, but also for manufacturing goods the masses may think they want, and for goods that we know we will need. A loyal group of ponies dedicated to ensuring numbers are met."
 
 EQC_MARE_war_rations:0 "War Rations"
 EQC_MARE_war_rations_desc:0 "The populace believes us to be at war, and we are. We are at war with the system of capitalism. The target doesn't matter, what matters is restricting access to goods for the needs of Society."
 
 EQC_MARE_build_for_austerity:0 "Build for Austerity"
 EQC_MARE_build_for_austerity_desc:0 "The economy is in a poor State thanks to the struggles of harmony and capitalism. Taking direct control of the economy and setting quotes on what needs to be built, and when, will see the rise of a new MARESOC economy."
 
 EQC_MARE_resources:0 "The Economy Drive"
 EQC_MARE_resources_desc:0 "The first measures implemented by the Party to repair the failing economy were a success. Now, it's time to encourage the masses to push forward and strive for more. More resources, more building, more technology."
 
 EQC_MARE_war_work_quotas:0 "War Work Quotas"
 EQC_MARE_war_work_quotas_desc:0 "The war against capitalism won't be won with kind words and hugs. Armament is required, and setting quotas to all the State owned factories, with rewards for those that meet them, will bring about a golden age of military production."
 
 EQC_MARE_variable_production_reports:0 "Variable Production Reports"
 EQC_MARE_variable_production_reports_desc:0 "Varying what each factory needs to produce, and rotating them in and out, and giving some a break for hard work will bring about more dedicated and efficient work for Society."

 #Ministry of Peace
 EQC_found_minipax:0 "War Is Peace"
 EQC_found_minipax_desc:0 "The Ministry of Peace will be responsible for maintaining a state of perpetual state forever. It is vital that we are strong enough to survive, yet not too strong to end our wars too quickly. Constant war preserves the special mental atmosphere that a hierarchical society needs."

 EQC_MARE_loyalist_officers:0 "MARESOC Officers"
 EQC_MARE_loyalist_officers_desc:0 "Prior to MARESOC's coup, many officers remained loyal to such abhorrent things as democracy and Equestria. Now those officers never existed. New ones are needed to restore order in the leaderless army. Promising and orthodox party members will thus be rewarded with positions of command in the military."

 EQC_MARE_army_work_placements:0 "Duty To The Nation"
 EQC_MARE_army_work_placements_desc:0 "It is the patriotic duty of every party member and prole to safeguard their country from counter-revolutionary aggression and despicable foreigners. Military training will be mandatory and everypony must be ready to serve in the army if necessary."

 EQC_MARE_peace_forces:0 "The Military Reborn"
 EQC_MARE_peace_forces_desc:0 "The old army of New Mareland has been moulded in our image. Heretics have been culled and discipline restored. Every soldier is willing to die for Big Sister. This is the embryo of a mighty army that will one day crush all our rivals and enemies."

 #Minipax Army
 EQC_MARE_land:0 "The New Army of Marelandia"
 EQC_MARE_land_desc:0 "An army, loyal to the whims of the Party, is the only way to truly hold territory gained, and to defend MARESOC against any external threats. Their task is to ensure war can be maintained for as long as possible, and to waste surplus production on warfare."

 EQC_MARE_new_ways_to_kill:0 "Technology of Death"
 EQC_MARE_new_ways_to_kill_desc:0 "Technological progress is only allowed to happen when innovations can be used for oppression or conquest. Improved rifles and heavy guns contribute to the latter and strengthen our army. Such innovations must be encouraged, for they will eventually allow MARESOC to overcome all its enemies."

 EQC_MARE_war_machines:0 "Marelandia Is Indestructible"
 EQC_MARE_war_machines_desc:0 "Already, nopony is allowed to cross the border. It must be fortified even further in preparation for enemy aggression. Thousands of workers shall labour ceaselessly, to the death if need be, to turn our nation into an unassailable, invincible fortress. Nothing can threaten the rule of MARESOC."
 
 EQC_MARE_mass_combat:0 "A Wave of Flesh"
 EQC_MARE_mass_combat_desc:0 "Marelandia is small and weak. If we wish to accomplish our goal of total world conquest, we must become strong. Our army must rival that of our neighbours despite our lesser population and industry. We will forcefully conscript as many ponies as we need to drown our enemies in the blood of our soldiers."

 EQC_MARE_mass_production:0 "Mass Production"
 EQC_MARE_mass_production_desc:0 "Our army is always in need of more tools of slaughter. The proles shall be sent into the arms factories to labour ceaselessly and fill the production quotas. Sacrifices will have to be made in regards to quality, but several soldiers dying from malfunctioning weaponry is an acceptable loss."

 EQC_MARE_extermination_research:0 "Unrestricted Experimentation"
 EQC_MARE_extermination_research_desc:0 "In Marelandia science, in the old sense, has almost ceased to exist. Methods of empiricism and rationality, which contradict the principles of MARESOC, are only applied where necessary, such as development of new weapons. As morality is whatever the Party wants it to be, this research can now be unshackled."

 #Minipax Airforce
 EQC_MARE_air:0 "The New Airforce of Marelandia"
 EQC_MARE_air_desc:0 "We are the rightful inheritors of the New Mareland Airforce, and we will repurpose it into a tool of destruction. Whoever rules the skies rules the battlefield, and whoever rules the battlefield will eventually rule the world. Our ample supply of aluminium and experienced pilots allow us to wield the mightiest airforce on the continent."

 EQC_MARE_fighters:0 "Aerial Supremacy"
 EQC_MARE_fighters_desc:0 "Our aircraft need to be ever faster, nimbler and more lethal. Each new model must surpass the previous one. Yet quantity must not be sacrificed for quality. If we not only outclass the enemy, but outclass them, we will achieve total domination of the sky. Engineers and factory workers must get to work!"

 EQC_MARE_bombers:0 "Death From Above"
 EQC_MARE_bombers_desc:0 "If we wish to bound our foes into complete submission, we need to bombard the civilians and destroy the factories. When we show them how vulnerable they are, strike at their dearest monuments and massacre helpless civilians, their morale will be devastated, and they will become weak from fear."

 EQC_MARE_atomic_purges:0 "Weapons of Mass Destruction"
 EQC_MARE_atomic_purges_desc:0 "The ultimate show of force is the only way to guarantee MARESOC's rise and the utter eradication of capitalism, and what better way than a mixture of science and magic so dangerous it should not be used bar the most extraordinary of circumstances?"

 #Minipax Navy
 EQC_MARE_sea:0 "The New Navy of Marelandia"
 EQC_MARE_sea_desc:0 "The ships of the Royal Mareland Navy have been collectivized by the state. They shall now be put to use to defend our long coastline and to control the ocean around us, cutting off any maritime supply lines and trade links of our enemies."

 EQC_MARE_convoy_raiding:0 "Choke Them"
 EQC_MARE_convoy_raiding_desc:0 "Any Equestrian force that invades Marelania would have to bring supplies across the seas to keep their troops supplied. Hunting and sinking these logistics ships will leave any invaders stranded and starving, making them easy prey for our soldiers."

 EQC_MARE_terror_ships:0 "Floating Fortresses"
 EQC_MARE_terror_ships_desc:0 "It is inevitable that our navy will have to fight in direct combat with another navy, and ensuring our capital ships are top of the line will prevent us from being defeated. Constructing huge mobile behemoths of steel armed to the brim with weaponry will guarantee naval dominance."

 EQC_MARE_sea_of_death:0 "Sea of Death"
 EQC_MARE_sea_of_death_desc:0 "Filling the seas with submarines will bring death to all merchant shipping, as well as surface fleets our enemies will inevitably send after us."

 ##I cannot fucking believe maresoc did not have any events whatsoever, really shows how poorly done this path was
 ##anyways yes here's event loc
 
 mareland.69.t:0 "Rocket Bombs Hit Sunset!"
 mareland.69.d:0 "At midday a loud shriek could be heard above Sunset, moments before the sound of a booming explosion echoed in the streets. A grey trail of smoke pierced the sky, left by a rocket that had travelled faster than sound. It had landed near the city center, in an industrial district during the busiest working hours. A large factory had been reduced to a huge, smoking crater, with bits of flesh scattered around it.\n\nIt did not take long for propaganda to spread news of the event. Equestria had launched a rocket across the sea and killed 156 innocent civilians and wounding several hundred others. It was clear to all now that Celestia was a callous tyrant who was not above murdering helpless ponies to break Marelander morale. More rocket bombs were to be expected, but the citizens of Marelandia were not afraid. No, they were emboldened, and more willing than ever to fight against the despicable, immoral foe! Young ponies flocked to the recruitment centers and enthusiastically joined the army and airforce, eager to defend their homes from such strikes."
 mareland.69.a:0 "Death to Equestrian scum!"
