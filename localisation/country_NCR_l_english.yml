 ncr_eqs_civil_war.1.t:0 "The Equestrian Civil War"
 ncr_eqs_civil_war.1.d:0 "Equestria has descended into Civil War. The ponies living to our east have declared themselves in rebellion against [EQS.GetLeader]'s government and have formed the [SCS.GetName]. Meanwhile, in the East, forces loyal to Nightmare Moon have risen up to bring about eternal darkness over the land. The Sunshine Peninsular to our east has found itself cut off from the rest of Equestria and without protection. A proposal has been put forth to bring the territory under our administration for the time being. It is not expected that Equestria will retaliate, for now."
 ncr_eqs_civil_war.1.a:0 "We should bring the Sunshine Peninsular under our protection."
 ncr_eqs_civil_war.1.b:0 "We will watch the situation closely."

 ncr_eqs_civil_war.2.t:0 "[NCR.GetNameDef] has Seized the Sunshine Peninsular"
 ncr_eqs_civil_war.2.d:0 "NCR troops have entered and occupied the Sunshine Peninsular on our south coast. While this land-grab breaks our treaties, we have had reassurances that the ponies who live there will receive the same rights as the other ponies living under their rule. With our nation in chaos, there is very little we can do for now to stop this."
 ncr_eqs_civil_war.2.a:0 "What will those humans do next?"

 ncr_eqs_civil_war.3.t:0 "The Sunshine Peninsular joins the Confederacy"
 ncr_eqs_civil_war.3.d:0 "For a moment it appeared that the Sunshine Peninsular would fall under the control of the human occupiers, but it appears that the NCR has no interest in the souther coast. Worried for their future, the ponies living there have voted on joining the Confederacy, seeking safety with their fellow southern brothers."
 ncr_eqs_civil_war.3.a:0 "Welcome friends."

#  NCR_gw_tank_equipment_desc:0 "Named after it's inventor, the Bitty Simple Tank successfully passed its first combat trials in the Cockatrice War. During the battle of Woolumbool the tank, commanded by Bitty Simple herself, managed to rout the cockatrice forces without a single casualty — other than a gunner who chipped their tooth when the tank started moving."
#  NCR_gw_tank_equipment_short:0 "Bitty Simple"

#  NCR_light_tank_equipment_1:0 "M1 Cockatoo"
#  NCR_light_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Free of Equestrian bureaucracy, New Mareland industrial concerns were largely autonomous in early tank development. Their first designs were thus more evolutionary than revolutionary. Externally, these tanks looked very similar to the earliest makeshift conversions of agricultural machinery, but they had significant internal mechanical improvements. While larger, heavier, and somehow even more annoying than the Equestrian Breezies, these tanks had similar performance."
#  NCR_light_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Cockatoo"
#  NCR_light_tank_equipment_2:0 "M2 Emu"
#  NCR_light_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The M2 Emu was the result of work on the concept of a tank design that was ‘convertible’, or able to run on either treads or wheels. With heavier armor than the Cockatoo, and a cannon instead of only machine guns, it replaced the earlier design. Somewhat inferior to the Equestrian Muletilda, it was still relatively effective, if mechanically over-complicated, and the design concept was not developed further."
#  NCR_light_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Emu"
#  NCR_light_tank_equipment_3:0 "M3 CM-NMAC Crusader ‘Babs Seed’"
#  NCR_light_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "By this point, New Mareland’s industry was primarily focused on their successful medium tank designs. Given limited development resources and the unimpressive characteristics of past New Mareland light tanks, it was decided to produce a local version of the CM Crusader instead of expending time and effort on a unique local design, particularly as light tanks had largely been reduced to reconnaissance roles."

#  NCR_medium_tank_equipment_1:0 "M10 Ram"
#  NCR_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Like the Emu, the Ram was the result of concept work in a unique direction; in this case, a hull cast as a single piece. Unlike the Emu, the Ram was considered an unreserved success. Relative to the Equestrian Timberwolf, the Ram had inferior firepower but superior protection, a tradeoff most of its crews preferred."
#  NCR_medium_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Ram"
#  NCR_medium_tank_equipment_2:0 "AC1 Sentinel"
#  NCR_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "As Twilight development dragged on, New Mareland decided to create its own equivalent, based on the Ram. Rectifying the one real shortcoming of its predecessor, the resulting Sentinel design carried a vastly stronger weapon. When compared with the final results of the Twilight project, the Sentinel was found equivalent or superior to it in all major characteristics, and was greatly appreciated by the tank crews that used it."
#  NCR_medium_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Sentinel"
#  NCR_medium_tank_equipment_3:0 "AC3 Thunderbolt"
#  NCR_medium_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "The final evolution of the Ram and Sentinel designs, the Thunderbolt was essentially an up-armoured Sentinel with a somewhat more powerful engine and a new turret mounting a more potent gun. The only real limitation of this design remained New Mareland’s industrial constraints, as it was an excellent tank."

#  NCR_heavy_tank_equipment_1:0 "Crocodile M50 Heavy Tank"
#  NCR_heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Initial work on a much larger design was undertaken at the same time as the development of the Emu. Essentially just a bigger vehicle using the same component technologies, the ‘Crocodile’ project was abandoned once its manifest impracticalities became apparent, ending New Mareland’s brief foray into native heavy tank designing."
#  NCR_heavy_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Crocodile"
#  NCR_heavy_tank_equipment_2:0 "HC1 NMAC Celestia"
#  NCR_heavy_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Having abandoned Heavy Tank development, New Mareland produced a local variant of the Equestrian Celestia design. Though produced only in small numbers, the Celestia became surprisingly popular in peacetime as a patrol vehicle in the monster infested New Mareland outback, New Marelanders often fondly quipped that ‘it was more useful than a real alicorn anyway’."
#  NCR_heavy_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Celestia"
#  NCR_heavy_tank_equipment_3:0 "HC3 NMAC Ursa Minor"
#  NCR_heavy_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Plans were made for a local model of the Ursa Minor, but ultimately shelved in favour of continued production of existing designs. However, the post war popularity of the Celestia and continued tensions with Wingbardy led the New Mareland government import many Ursa Minors from Equestria after the war. They then enjoyed a small cult following, though never as much as the Celestia."

#  NCR_super_heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "When offloading their unwanted Ursa Minors, the Equestrian government also sent an old prototype of the shelved Ursa Major project. This quickly prompted national excitement when a local NMAC Celestia mechanic suggested it could be made to run, only ‘even bigger and with more guns’. Though ultimately useless, the restored vehicle became a popular tourist tradition, and inspired a series of New Mareland tourist traps each themed around very large versions of smaller objects."
