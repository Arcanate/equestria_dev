 GRY_raid_brodfeld:0 "Raid Brodfeld"
 GRY_raid_brodfeld_desc:0 "Normally, it would be against our pact with the Griffonian Emperor to raid Brodfeld. However, central authority has crumbled in recent decades, and no Imperial Official has appeared to demand tribute or renewal of our oaths in over a decade. It is safe to assume that the Emperor will not stop us from taking advantage of Brodfeld's instability to line our pockets..."

 GRY_raid_radicals_desc:0 "Ordinarily, we're not supposed to raid anyone west of the river, but surely that doesn't apply to vicious, anti-monarchist radicals? Besides, this "Communism" thing is appealing to an unsettling number of our youth, and it would be good to damage them however we can."

 GRY_prywhen_response_desc:0 "The GLA have managed to defeat the King of Brodfeld! This is a terrible threat, for they will surely turn their attention to us soon. We have to do something!"
