 GRY_raid_brodfeld:0 "Raid Brodfeld"
 GRY_raid_brodfeld_desc:0 "Normally, it would be against our pact with the Griffonian Emperor to raid Brodfeld. However, central authority has crumbled in recent decades, and no Imperial Official has appeared to demand tribute or renewal of our oaths in over a decade. It is safe to assume that the Emperor will not stop us from taking advantage of Brodfeld's instability to line our pockets..."
 GRY_raid_radicals:0 "Raid The GLA"
 GRY_raid_radicals_desc:0 "Ordinarily, we're not supposed to raid anyone west of the river, but surely that doesn't apply to vicious, anti-monarchist radicals? Besides, this "Communism" thing is appealing to an unsettling number of our youth, and it would be good to damage them however we can."
 GRY_prywhen_response:0 "The Red Menace"
 GRY_prywhen_response_desc:0 "The GLA have managed to defeat the King of Brodfeld! This is a terrible threat, for they will surely turn their attention to us soon. We have to do something!"

 gryphianhost.103.d:0 "In its first official Universale, the Central Rada of the Gryphian Hetmanate has formally declared the dissolution of the old form of government, and has proclaimed that, forthwith, the people of Gryphus are governed by the Kaiv Commune, a proletarian government by the people, and for the people."
 gryphianhost.103.a:0 "The way of the future!"
 gryphianhost.104.t:0 "The Kaiv Commune reaches out in proletarian solidarity"
 gryphianhost.104.d:0 "The griffons of the Gryphian Host have overthrown their reactionary government, and wish to ally with us in a display of socialist brotherhood! How should we respond?"
 gryphianhost.104.a:0 "We warmly welcome our new comrades!"
 gryphianhost.104.b:0 "They are revisionists - we cannot risk our revolution by associating with them"
 gryphianhost.105.t:0 "A Shocking Proposal"
 gryphianhost.105.d:0 "[Root.gryevent105loc]"
 gryphianhost.105.a:0 "If Wavebreaker is alright with it, then I suppose we can let them in, but keep an eye on them!"
 gryphianhost.105.b:0 "Damn Lake City! Damn Wittenland! Don't they see this is a chance to end an ancient grudge?"
 gryphianhost.105.c:0 "Do they really expect us to believe they can change so suddenly?"
 gryphianhost.106.t:0 "Old Wounds Forgiven"
 gryphianhost.106.d:0 "To our great surprise and joy, the Riverponies have seen past the actions of our ancestors, and have recognised our new, Harmonic society. We are now a full-fledged member of the River Coalition!"
 gryphianhost.106.a:0 "Excellent!"
 gryphianhost.107.t:0 "No Water Under That Bridge"
 gryphianhost.107.d:0 "Sadly, though not unexpectedly, the Riverponies have rejected our appeal. We cannot look to them for protection, friendship, or security."
 gryphianhost.107.a:0 "We can't say we really blame them"
 gryphianhost.108.t:0 "A Great Change - If It's Real"
 gryphianhost.108.d:0 "In a shocking twist, our ancient enemies, the Gryphian Host, recently applied for membership in the River Coalition - and River City agreed! Though this has evoked protests from many of our citizens, the Gryphians really do seem to have changed, and [Root.GetLeader] assures the people that everything will be alright, and that the Gryphians will be booted back out at the first sign of trouble. While not everyone is happy with the situation, it seems as if they're putting up with it for the time being."
 gryphianhost.108.a:0 "I'm keeping my eye on them"
 gryphianhost.109.t:0 "Sanity Prevails"
 gryphianhost.109.d:0 "In a shocking twist, our ancient enemies, the Gryphian Host, recently applied for membership in the River Coalition! Thankfully, [From.GetLeader] had enough presence of mind to refuse their offer, not believing their ridiculous claim to have reformed totally."
 gryphianhost.109.a:0 "Good to know that [From.GetLeader] hasn't totally lost their marbles"
 gryphianhost.110.t:0 "An Outrage"
 gryphianhost.110.d:0 "Scandal! Horror! The Gryphian Host recently made the shocking move to ask for membership in the River Coalition - and [From.GetLeader] LET THEM IN! [Root.GetLeader] has voiced fierce protests at this shocking betrayal of our people. These Griffons have raided, slaughtered, and plundered our people for centuries, and [From.GetLeader] actually believed their nonsensical claims to have reformed? In response, [Root.GetLeader] has formally left the River Coalition, seeing that it clearly does not have our best interests at heart."
 gryphianhost.110.a:0 "How could River City betray us like that?"
 gryphianhost.111.t:0 "[From.GetName] asks for an alliance"
 gryphianhost.111.d:0 "A strange group of Griffons from the East, calling themselves the [From.GetName], have expressed interest in joining together with us for mutual assistance and protection. These griffons have a history as fierce warriors, and might be a useful addition to our coalition, though they are pretty far away..."
 gryphianhost.111.a:0 "Why would we turn aside potential allies?"
 gryphianhost.111.b:0 "We can't afford to defend such a remote location"
 gryphianhost.112.t:0 "[From.GetName] accepts"
 gryphianhost.112.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] has formally accepted [Root.GetLeader]'s offer of military alliance. We are now officially a part of [From.GetName]'s alliance."
 gryphianhost.112.a:0 "Excellent News!"
 gryphianhost.113.t:0 "[From.GetName] refuses"
 gryphianhost.113.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] has regretfully refused our offer of alliance, citing various problems that would result from it. We will have to look elsewhere for protection."
 gryphianhost.113.a:0 "Drat"
 gryphianhost.114.t:0 "The Gryphians Offer A Union"
 gryphianhost.114.d:0 "Representatives from the [From.GetName] arrived at government buildings today, in a manner which we've never seen them before. Up until now, the Gryphians had been known as fierce raiders, and we didn't much like meeting them, despite our distant ancestral connection. However, in recent years they have reformed their government into a more peaceful one, and have proclaimed interest in forming a "brotherhood of Zaphzans", which will encompass every Griffon of Zaphzan ancestry, including us. Though we haven't called ourselves Zaphzans for over a thousand years, some within our country think the offer is tempting. How shall we respond?"
 gryphianhost.114.a:0 "We will accept an offer of protection, but nothing more"
 gryphianhost.114.b:0 "Perhaps it would be good to draw closer to our ancestral brothers?"
 gryphianhost.114.c:0 "Laskavo prosymo, brothers!"
 gryphianhost.115.t:0 "The Question Of The Crown"
 gryphianhost.115.d:0 "[Root.GetLeader] has thoroughly crushed all opposition and established himself as ruler of the Zaphzans. So great is his power that he might, perhaps, lay claim to the long-defunct title of King of Zaphzia, which would restore the ancient glory of our people. However, we have a long tradition of democratically elected leaders, and it would perhaps be wiser (not to mention less contentious) if he were to simply reaffirm the title of Hetman (though he will not, of course, allow himself to be defeated in an election. That would be silly)."
 gryphianhost.115.a:0 "Hail to the King!"
 gryphianhost.115.b:0 "Of course, we must preserve our democratic traditions..."
 gryphianhost.116.t:0 "Fate Of The Reactionaries"
 gryphianhost.116.d:0 "We are in a difficult position regarding our brother-Cossacks. While a fair few of them supported the GSDLR in their revolution, many of them are staunch supporters of the old order. We cannot afford to ignore this issue, for they are some of our most vocal critics, but by the same token, they are also some of our most skilled military staff. We could simply execute them, but such a move would be deeply unpopular and would leave our military defanged and leaderless. Perhaps it would be better to convince them to join us, so as to integrate them into our new Red Army? This would be much smoother and would allow us to benefit from their extensive experience - but could we ever be certain of their loyalty?"
 gryphianhost.116.a:0 "Pardon them and integrate them into the Red Army"
 gryphianhost.116.b:0 "We cannot allow reactionary elements in our army! They must all go!"
 gryphianhost.117.t:0 "The Second Universale Of The Kaiv Commune"
 gryphianhost.117.d:0 "[Root.gryevent117loc]"
 gryphianhost.117.b:0 "We must stick with our older brothers in socialism"
 gryphianhost.117.a:0 "We will spread the revolution, whether alone or not!"
 gryphianhost.118.t:0 "Kaiv Commune proposes closer ties"
 gryphianhost.118.d:0 "The gryphons of Kaiv have thrown off the chains of oppression and established a socialist state by the banks of the River. Seeing that we also have come to see the eminent glory of socialism, they have offered to forge closer ties with us, to ensure peaceful coopoeration between socialists and defend the revolution from hostile foreign powers. However, there is some dispute among our most prominent officials about how far we ought to take this offer. Most are happy to accept Kaiv's offer of protection, but some wish to go further, and directly join with them against the forces of reaction."
 gryphianhost.118.a:0 "It is fine to defend one another, but we each must build our own socialism"
 gryphianhost.118.b:0 "We are small and surrounded by enemies. Perhaps it would be best to join more closely with them"
 gryphianhost.119.t:0 "The Kaiv Commune proposes a joint offensive"
 gryphianhost.119.d:0 "The Kaiv Commune has approached us with a drastic proposal, one that could significantly affect both of our futures. Militarism is growing within their nation, and their people are eager to spread the Revolution immediately, and by force. This would not be a problem, were it not for the fact that they wish to attack their neighbor, Wittenland. Ruled by a corrupt elite, Wittenland is certainly reactionary and worthy of being destroyed, but they are also protected by the entire River Coalition. A war against them would almost certainly call down the fury of the Riverponies upon our heads, a prospect we cannot take lightly. If we are going to discourage them from this attack, we had better do so now, and forcefully."
 gryphianhost.119.a:0 "Support the offensive! The riverponies must see the light of Communism also!"
 gryphianhost.119.b:0 "This is far too risky, it is insanity! Order them to back down"
 gryphianhost.120.t:0 "[From.GetName] backs us"
 gryphianhost.120.d:0 "Our proposal has been heard and accepted by our ally. [Root.GetName] has agreed to join us in the great struggle to free the workers of Wittenland."
 gryphianhost.120.a:0 "To war, then!"
 gryphianhost.121.t:0 "[From.GetName]'s ultimatum"
 gryphianhost.121.d:0 "Our ally has heard our proposal, and responded swiftly. They have stated in no uncertain terms that an attack upon Wittenland would result in the destruction of both their nation and ours, and they categorically refuse to help us in any such endeavour. They have presented us a stark choice - give up our goals on Wittenland, or have our alliance formally severed."
 gryphianhost.121.a:0 "Cowards! We will not be dissuaded like this! To war!"
 gryphianhost.121.b:0 "We cannot afford to ruin our relationships with our friends like this - back down on our claims"
 gryphianhost.122.t:0 "[From.GetLeader] severs ties"
 gryphianhost.122.d:0 "The Kaivans have not listened to us, scorning us for our "cowardice" and "revisionism". [From.GetLeader] has formally severed ties with [Root.GetName], and plans for the invasion of Wittenland are proceeding apace."
 gryphianhost.122.a:0 "Those stubborn fools!"
 gryphianhost.123.t:0 "[From.GetLeader] backs down"
 gryphianhost.123.d:0 "Under our threat, [From.GetLeader] has withdrawn their hostile rhetoric towards Wittenland, and quietly shelves their plans for an invasion. It seems that peace, for now, has prevailed."
 gryphianhost.123.a:0 "At least we won't be dragged into a stupid, unwinnable war"
 gryphianhost.124.t:0 "Re-establishing Contact"
 gryphianhost.124.d:0 "While we cut ourselves off from the outside world during the war, now that we have successfully proven that we can in fact defeat the Riverponies, we should re-open communication."
 gryphianhost.124.a:0 "At last"

The Riverponies are a large coalition of mostly-Harmonic nations that is near us, and would offer us substantial protection and aid - if it were not for the centuries of built-up hate from our history of raiding them violently. It is possible, however, that the new leadership of the River Coalition will think differently, but Lake City, unless led by the most moderate and Harmonic candidate possible, is almost certain to block our entry."

However, we are now quite certain that, yes, the Gryphian Host does indeed wish to join our alliance. They claim to have reformed their ways, creating a Harmonic and peaceful society, and to have given up raiding. Needless to say, most ponies have had a hard time believing this. Certain ponies, such as Lake City's Wavebreaker, have been urging that it is at least worth trying, while many still feel that they are insincere. Despite official complaints from Wittenland and Lake City, their leaders have assured us that they will follow our lead if we really wish to accept."

However, now we face the very important issue of our foreign policy. While we are grateful to our friends in the People's Republic Of Prywhen, there is division among the Rada about how closely we should tie ourselves to them. The supporters of Khurshevich hold that it would be best to tie ourselves further to Prywhen, for the world is large and filled with people who hate us, and it would be foolish to strike out on our own and risk alienating our only reliable ally. However, his opponents have criticised this policy, calling it "revisionist" and claiming that Comrade Khurshevich simply lacks with courage to stand up to the forces of reaction."
