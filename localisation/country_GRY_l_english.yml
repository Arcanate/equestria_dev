 GRY_raid_brodfeld:0 "Raid Brodfeld"
 GRY_raid_brodfeld_desc:0 "Normally, it would be against our pact with the Griffonian Emperor to raid Brodfeld. However, central authority has crumbled in recent decades, and no Imperial Official has appeared to demand tribute or renewal of our oaths in over a decade. It is safe to assume that the Emperor will not stop us from taking advantage of Brodfeld's instability to line our pockets..."
 GRY_raid_radicals:0 "Raid The GLA"
 GRY_raid_radicals_desc:0 "Ordinarily, we're not supposed to raid anyone west of the river, but surely that doesn't apply to vicious, anti-monarchist radicals? Besides, this "Communism" thing is appealing to an unsettling number of our youth, and it would be good to damage them however we can."
 GRY_prywhen_response:0 "The Red Menace"
 GRY_prywhen_response_desc:0 "The GLA have managed to defeat the King of Brodfeld! This is a terrible threat, for they will surely turn their attention to us soon. We have to do something!"

 gryphianhost.103.t:0 "Proclamation Of The Kaiv Commune"
 gryphianhost.103.d:0 "In its first official Universale, the Central Rada of the Gryphian Hetmanate has formally declared the dissolution of the old form of government, and has proclaimed that, forthwith, the people of Gryphus are governed by the Kaiv Commune, a proletarian government by the people, and for the people."
 gryphianhost.103.a:0 "The way of the future!"
 gryphianhost.104.t:0 "The Kaiv Commune reaches out in proletarian solidarity"
 gryphianhost.104.d:0 "The griffons of the Gryphian Host have overthrown their reactionary government, and wish to ally with us in a display of socialist brotherhood! How should we respond?"
 gryphianhost.104.a:0 "We warmly welcome our new comrades!"
 gryphianhost.104.b:0 "They are revisionists - we cannot risk our revolution by associating with them"
 gryphianhost.105.t:0 "A Shocking Proposal"
 gryphianhost.105.d:0 "[Root.gryevent105loc]"
 gryphianhost.105.a:0 "If Wavebreaker is alright with it, then I suppose we can let them in, but keep an eye on them!"
 gryphianhost.105.b:0 "Damn Lake City! Damn Wittenland! Don't they see this is a chance to end an ancient grudge?"
 gryphianhost.105.c:0 "Do they really expect us to believe they can change so suddenly?"
 gryphianhost.106.t:0 "Old Wounds Forgiven"
 gryphianhost.106.d:0 "To our great surprise and joy, the Riverponies have seen past the actions of our ancestors, and have recognised our new, Harmonic society. We are now a full-fledged member of the River Coalition!"
 gryphianhost.106.a:0 "Excellent!"
 gryphianhost.107.t:0 "No Water Under That Bridge"
 gryphianhost.107.d:0 "Sadly, though not unexpectedly, the Riverponies have rejected our appeal. We cannot look to them for protection, friendship, or security."
 gryphianhost.107.a:0 "We can't say we really blame them"
 gryphianhost.108.t:0 "A Great Change - If It's Real"
 gryphianhost.108.d:0 "In a shocking twist, our ancient enemies, the Gryphian Host, recently applied for membership in the River Coalition - and River City agreed! Though this has evoked protests from many of our citizens, the Gryphians really do seem to have changed, and [Root.GetLeader] assures the people that everything will be alright, and that the Gryphians will be booted back out at the first sign of trouble. While not everyone is happy with the situation, it seems as if they're putting up with it for the time being."
 gryphianhost.108.a:0 "I'm keeping my eye on them"
 gryphianhost.109.t:0 "Sanity Prevails"
 gryphianhost.109.d:0 "In a shocking twist, our ancient enemies, the Gryphian Host, recently applied for membership in the River Coalition! Thankfully, [From.GetLeader] had enough presence of mind to refuse their offer, not believing their ridiculous claim to have reformed totally."
 gryphianhost.109.a:0 "Good to know that [From.GetLeader] hasn't totally lost their marbles"
 gryphianhost.110.t:0 "An Outrage"
 gryphianhost.110.d:0 "Scandal! Horror! The Gryphian Host recently made the shocking move to ask for membership in the River Coalition - and [From.GetLeader] LET THEM IN! [Root.GetLeader] has voiced fierce protests at this shocking betrayal of our people. These Griffons have raided, slaughtered, and plundered our people for centuries, and [From.GetLeader] actually believed their nonsensical claims to have reformed? In response, [Root.GetLeader] has formally left the River Coalition, seeing that it clearly does not have our best interests at heart."
 gryphianhost.110.a:0 "How could River City betray us like that?"
 gryphianhost.111.t:0 "[From.GetName] asks for an alliance"
 gryphianhost.111.d:0 "A strange group of Griffons from the East, calling themselves the [From.GetName], have expressed interest in joining together with us for mutual assistance and protection. These griffons have a history as fierce warriors, and might be a useful addition to our coalition, though they are pretty far away..."
 gryphianhost.111.a:0 "Why would we turn aside potential allies?"
 gryphianhost.111.b:0 "We can't afford to defend such a remote location"
 gryphianhost.112.t:0 "[From.GetName] accepts"
 gryphianhost.112.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] has formally accepted [Root.GetLeader]'s offer of military alliance. We are now officially a part of [From.GetName]'s alliance."
 gryphianhost.112.a:0 "Excellent News!"
 gryphianhost.113.t:0 "[From.GetName] refuses"
 gryphianhost.113.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] has regretfully refused our offer of alliance, citing various problems that would result from it. We will have to look elsewhere for protection."
 gryphianhost.113.a:0 "Drat"
 gryphianhost.114.t:0 "The Gryphians Offer A Union"
 gryphianhost.114.d:0 "Representatives from the [From.GetName] arrived at government buildings today, in a manner which we've never seen them before. Up until now, the Gryphians had been known as fierce raiders, and we didn't much like meeting them, despite our distant ancestral connection. However, in recent years they have reformed their government into a more peaceful one, and have proclaimed interest in forming a "brotherhood of Zaphzans", which will encompass every Griffon of Zaphzan ancestry, including us. Though we haven't called ourselves Zaphzans for over a thousand years, some within our country think the offer is tempting. How shall we respond?"
 gryphianhost.114.a:0 "We will accept an offer of protection, but nothing more"
 gryphianhost.114.b:0 "Perhaps it would be good to draw closer to our ancestral brothers?"
 gryphianhost.114.c:0 "Laskavo prosymo, brothers!"

 GRY_ally_RIV:0 "Reach Out To The Riverponies"
 GRY_ally_RIV_desc:0 "Now that we have reformed our nation, we must look for friends elsewhere. The Riverponies are a large coalition of mostly-Harmonic nations that is near us, and would offer us substantial protection and aid - if it were not for the centuries of built-up hate from our history of raiding them violently. It is possible, however, that the new leadership of the River Coalition will think differently, but Lake City, unless led by the most moderate and Harmonic candidate possible, is almost certain to block our entry."
 GRY_ally_WNG:0 "Join The Karthinian Pact"
 GRY_ally_WNG_desc:0 "While we have rarely had much contact with the Griffons of the South, it is undeniable that they would make useful allies. They are relatively close to us, are ideologically compatible, and are powerful enough to resist most of the powers on this continent. We should appeal to their King, asking him to protect us."
 GRY_ally_JER:0 "Ally With The Aquilean Republic"
 GRY_ally_JER_desc:0 "Aquilea is a distant land that we have little contact with, but they have recently become a Republic, and would make for powerful friends if we could convince them to join with us."

Our raiders have taken care to avoid areas known to be controlled by the Griffonian Liberation Army, as they are well-armed and desperate, possessed of little worth taking. Now we need merely await news from our raiding parties..."

 GRY_GRW_raid_desc:0 "Taking advantage of the chaos caused by the civil war, Hetman Euros has decided to send raiding parties into Brodfeld, to sieze loot and plunder for the Host. Our raiders have been instructed to focus on attacking the Griffonian Liberation Army, to sieze their weapons and hurt their chances of spreading their poisonous ideology any further. Now we need merely await news from our raiding parties..."
 GRY_105_wb_elected:0 "[Root.GetLeader] has today received unbelievable news - so much so that it was initially assumed to be a joke. However, we are now quite certain that, yes, the Gryphian Host does indeed wish to join our alliance. They claim to have reformed their ways, creating a Harmonic and peaceful society, and to have given up raiding. Needless to say, most ponies have had a hard time believing this. Certain ponies, such as Lake City's Wavebreaker, have been urging that it is at least worth trying, while many still feel that they are insincere. Despite official complaints from Wittenland and Lake City, their leaders have assured us that they will follow our lead if we really wish to accept."
