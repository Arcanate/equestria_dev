 SPL_minority_rule:0 "Minority Rule"
 SPL_minority_rule_desc:0 "Despite decades of extensive immigration, the ruling Deer make up only 20% of Stagpal’s population, and they aren’t very popular. The Deer have to invest a lot of time and effort into keeping the populace under control. "
 SPL_elitist_army:0 "Limited Draft"
 SPL_elitist_army_desc:0 "Stagpal was founded by Deer warriors, and it needs a large caste of Deer warriors to ensure the peace is kept. On top of that, the Llamas have absolutely no intention of fighting and dying for foreign conquerers, and almost always manage to evade the draft with help from llama locals. As a result Stagpal’s army has no choice but to be a small elite force."
