Dusktalon and his cronies will not harm innocent ponies anymore! A new dawn rises, and we will be free!". The partisans cheered and stomped their hooves in response.

Nothing he said got to him! \n\nAs he was leaving the Count's residence, flanked by the Reformisten guards, he heard a pony screaming. Silvertalon closed his eyes and sighed. He had no real love for the ponies, but it was obvious slaughtering them senselessly would cause an even bigger disaster later on! \n\nIt is time to meet with the generals, and begin the plot to restore the honour of Longsword."
