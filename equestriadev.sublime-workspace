Suddenly a young, pretty pony with light pink coloured fur and dark blue hair stops by you as you find yourself gazing over the poster and several figures of King Sombra. You turn to her to find she also stares at the things the store sells. - Wish he returns one day, - she says quietly. - What? - you ask. - Have you ever wondered, what would the Crystal Empire be like, if King Sombra returned? - she replied. You look at her, stunned. - Come join us to find out, - she says and puts a note into your hoof.\"\ncryscr.12.a:0 \"A-alright.\"\ncryscr.12.b:0 \"Are you crazy?!\"\ncryscr.13.t:0 \"Interesting Development.\"\ncryscr.13.d:0 \"You're given an invitation to a club called \"Stories of the Frost\", as it says on the card. The description on the other side reads: \"Join historical literature club of the Amethyst University. Tea, cookies and long talks about world history are granted! Topfloor, 37.\". Sounds like fun, you think. The girl however, without long goodbyes, walks away, before you can ask anything else.

However up until now you kept the card and today, you finally had the time to follow the instructions that supposedly should lead you to the club location. As there was something alluring in that card, that girl and what she said that day. You took a walk through the streets and found yourself on the end of the suggested route. An ordinary, newly built aparment building was in front of you.\"\ncryscr.15.a:0 \"Right into the 37.\"\ncryscr.15.b:0 \"What am I doing?\"\ncryscr.16.t:0 \"First Meeting.\"\ncryscr.16.d:0 \"You walk all the way to the top floor of the apartment building. Slowly taking the stairs in anticipation. After knocking on the wooden door, you are greeted by a stallion in an old, dusty magician robe. - Is this some kind of cosplay meeting? - you think. The stallion motions you to come in and closes the door, after you enter. The apartment is illuminated only by pony magic, candles, luminous plants and crystals. Despite this terrible lighting system, you can distinguish a bunch of ponies on the couch, at the table and on the floor. Suddenly, the pony you met at the store comes up to you out of dark doorway, which as you suppose leads to the kitchen, - I was waiting! - exclaims she with excitement.\"\ncryscr.16.a:0 \"Oh, huh?\"\ncryscr.17.t:0 \"The Club.\"\ncryscr.17.d:0 \"- Welcome to the history club! Hurray! - she cries joyfully. Everypony support her with a weary \"Hurray\". - We are studying magic, literature, history, politics and evolution science here, but most improtantly, we are united by one idea: the Crystal Empire needs Sombra back!\\n- What makes you think this is such a good thing? - you ask after a short silence. - Apparently, this guy never read a history book in his life, - remarks a colt from darkness. A wave of quiet giggling rolls in the room. - What do you know, that I don't? - you say. -Sit down, - says an old stallion, who was also wearing an antique magicians mantle.\"\ncryscr.17.a:0 \"Right.\"\ncryscr.18.t:0 \"The Stories of the Forst\"\ncryscr.18.d:0 \"As you sit down around a coffee table with a flower emitting turquoise coloured light, the old pony begins his story.\\n - I remember the King. I remember the times when the Crystal Empire was great and powerful, was really an Empire. The lands of the Yaks were under our control, the Northern Shores were our second home, and eastern lands of the deers... The Crystal Ponies were true masters of Equestria. The soil was rich, the grass was green, economy of the empire thrived and the ponies were free. It was then the Equestrian Alicorn sisters started to become jealous of the greatness and power. Using their dark magic of the so-called Elements of Harmony, they imprisoned the king and all of the Crystal ponies in a place outside time and space for more than a thousand years. And now, the Crystal Empire is impertinently stomped on by the sisters of Equestria and their puppet, unlawfully setup princess Mi Amore Cadenza. Thus we only see our future, and the future of the Crystal nation with return of King Sombra. With our help and his magic, we will bring the old Glory of the Crystal Empire back! - the stallion stopped and started coughing.\"\ncryscr.18.a:0 \"I see.\"\ncryscr.19.t:0 \"An Offer of the Lifetime\"\ncryscr.19.d:0 \"For more than two hours the ponies narrated you the history of the Crystal Empire, the times when King Sombra ruled over the land. That he was wise, just and cared about the people. That the sisters envied his glory and majesty. All of this greatly differed from the equestrian narrative, but sounded so convincing and motivational.\\n - We've been watching you for months, - says the old pony suddenly, - We know you want to help. We know, you want to aid King Sombra's escape from his shameful prison. The crystal ponies must rise against decay and opression. The time is perfect, frankly, as the stars align in the correct position only one time in five hundred years. The current position will strengthen the reincarnation spell. There is a way to bring King Sombra back, but we need your help! Together, we will change the history of the Crystal Empire, and maybe the whole world, to better!\"\ncryscr.19.a:0 \"Right.\"\ncryscr.20.t:0 \"The Decision\"\ncryscr.20.d:0 \"You exit the apartment and walk home, reconsidering your life choices. You were offered to change history, are you really that powerful, do you really have a right to decide lifes of millions of ponies? - The group believed that I'm one of them, but what if they really succeed, - you whisper, - Maybe I should report that to police while we've still got time? - Thinking about all that you lose track of time and route, endlessly wandering around the streets of the Crystal City. You get home late in the evening, sit down at the kitchen table and the decision strikes your head.\"\ncryscr.20.a:0 \"I have to join!\"\ncryscr.20.b:0 \"This organization is a threat to peace and harmony!\"\ncryscr.20.c:0 \"I'm not the one they're looking for.\"\ncryscr.21.t:0 \"Reported.\"\ncryscr.21.d:0 \"The next day you immediately go to the nearest police office and report everything that you've been told. The police squad takes a car and drives to the house, 37th flat. The special police unit breaks the door, the girl ponies in the room scream out of surpise. Some huge bouncer stallion tried to resist, but he policeponies knew their job. Everypony was seized and gunned down. As they're taken into the van, you notice the cream-pink pony being led with hoofcuffs, that is evident that she is terribly scared of what awaits her. Then she notices you in the crowd, her eyes round in shock. And you never asked her name. The doors are closed and the van drives off.\"\ncryscr.21.a:0 \"So be it.\"\ncryscr.22.t:0 \"The Return of Sombra.\"\ncryscr.22.d:0 \"You wake up from terrible noise and see a huge cloud of smoke. A sound of aircraft engines flying overhead is roaring in your ears. You take your stuff and get out on the street. The ponies are running around in panic. - Sombra has returned! - You hear somepony scream in the crowd. The cloud disappears and you can hear gunshots in distance. After several hours after you find yourself in a drafting centre, you're given a rifle and told to go on the street fight position. - Protect the Princess, Protect the Harmony, - exclaims the sergeant. Sombra's supporters are taking up arms. The return of Sombra has grown into a civil war. A civil war that Crystal Empire has never seen before. The club succeeded after all...\"\ncryscr.22.a:0 \"No way.\"\ncryscr.23.t:0 \"Back to the Club\"\ncryscr.23.d:0 \"After a while you are fully convinced that the return Sombra is essential for the better future of the Empire and its citizens. You hit the road to the club apartment where you now meet only four ponies. Sakira Bluebell, the pink-furred earthpony with dark blue mane and deep dark bluish violet eyes. Dust Snowfall, the old earthpony stallion with pale-light ochre fur, long grizzle old pony's mane and never changing tired look on his face. Lake Frost, light-blue, nearly white unicorn with reflective dark-blue hair, the one who wore the magician's mantle before. And new to you, Red Peyote, a huge bouncer pony, with all way round musculature, seemed only his horn didn't have any extra meat. - It is a pleasure to meet you, - said Snowfall, - We have been working on a plan on how to help King Sombra return for months. Your assistance will be extremely helpful.\"\ncryscr.23.a:0 \"I'm in.\"\ncryscr.24.t:0 \"Knowledge of the elders\"\ncryscr.24.d:0 \"In order to bring King Sombra back from his magical prison, we have to acquire an ancient rune, and a crystal heart charged with dark magic. With that we will be able to replace the Crystal Heart that creates the shield between the world of the living and the Limbo, imprisoning King Sombra. We know, that the secret of reincarnation spell and the formula to create the dark heart lies among the many scrolls and books in the Amethyst University Library. However, dark magic is strictly forbidden by law in the Empire and all ponies require highest authorization to access the Forbidden Section. We will have to reserve to extreme measures: enchant the librarians and guards. This is a dangerous enterprise, are you with us?\"\ncryscr.24.a:0 \"That is why I'm here.\"\ncryscr.25.t:0 \"On the way\"\ncryscr.25.d:0 \"On the next day you join up with Sakira on one of the central streets. She waves you from the other side and you hastely run across the street even though there are not that many cars at all. Almost like a stroll with a friend. Except the stroll is with a purpose of changing history. You chat with Sakira for a while during the walk, she gives you a glance on her life, she is a history student and always admired King Sombra, after the stories of Dust Snowfall she was decided for herself to do everything to make for King Sombra's return.\"\ncryscr.25.a:0 \"I see.\"\ncryscr.26.t:0 \"Entrance.\"\ncryscr.26.d:0 \"You join up with the second part of the group. Only Peyote, the bouncer stallion, wasn't there. A giant university library is in front of you. In silence, you go up the stairs. Inside, an old pony librarian greets you. They know the students and the old pony well. Every step and word echoes in the empty, silent, but charming halls. The only presense of life in here are student ponies, quietly reading their study books and whispering something to each other. You head to the center of the hall, then turn left, all the way to the wall, between the shelves, another turn to the left, some more turns, into a passway, and there it is, \"The Forbidden Section\". Two guards were playing chess on a coffee table near the door. The plan was enacted. Sakira went up to the guys and started a small talk with them. Meanwhile, using, it seemed, all his power, Lake casted a controlling spell on the stallions. Their eyes turned green, they got back to playing chess, in oblivion, enchanted. - I practiced that for months, - sighed Lake and, using their keys, opened the door...\"\ncryscr.26.a:0 \"Forward.\"\ncryscr.27.t:0 \"The Library\"\ncryscr.27.d:0 \"You've spent three hours in the library. The ancient dusty books, although having heavy, monotone way of narration, were very useful in your studies. Most of the time you spent walking around the shelves, trying to find the required book, in the end, everypony gathered in center. - We better hurry, the spell on those guards will soon unwind, - noted Dust. - Well, - you start, - as it turned out,  to construct the ominous dark heart, three things are required. First - basic crystal rocks, second - red umbrum crystal and third - time for the Dark Heart to grow. We will have to head to the Mountains, to the caves near Snowybury or the Umbrum Cage to find the crystals. The spell of growth used for plants may speed up the growing rate. - That is right, and we shall activate the Crystals around the city, too, fill them with magic, for it will make the reincarnation spell much stronger in the end, - added Dust. - Here's the pectagram that we will have to draw, before casting the spell.\"\ncryscr.27.a:0 \"Answers, finally!\"\ncryscr.30.t:0 \"Hit the road\"\ncryscr.30.d:0 \"You studied everything carefully many times together and the spiritual connection between you and other ponies became very strong.
