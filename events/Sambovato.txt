    Given the unrest that the organic gasification program causes due to deforestation, we should use the current abundance of fuel to host a grand flight show, and by doing so calming the populace and possibly finding new gems under our Pilots.

    This will of course cost us a bit, we will have to set up a proper airfield and get all aircraft into a presentable condition, after all we intend to impress so everything has to be in order.
    But this will lift the spirits of the people by showing them the wonders of modern technology.

    The Pilots will start with simple formation flights while gradually moving into harder maneuvers.
    The grand final will be our two best pilots flying in perfect sync while doing maneuvers for a couple of minutes.
    Once they finish their performance and get back on the ground we will start the fireworks as the final piece of this marvelous display.  

    There is of course the all so slight chance that the people could see this show of splendor as a waste of the fuel we created by our exploitations, but is that enough of a reason to give up such a clear sign of progress for our Nation?
