[h1]🏞 Ponies at the Ready 1.3.6 🏞[/h1]

The Crystal Empire has only resurfaced a few years ago, but the nation has been forced to adapt to the modern times. Many pleasant things have come of this, but with the growing threat of war, even the Princess of Love has been forced to call her ponies to arms. Equipped with powerful rifles and protected by their snowflake-pattern helmets, the new model Crystal Army prepare alongside their friends from Equestria. 

To the north, the Changelings gather their strength. The fearsome dark bugs gather at the border, eagerly calling for their commander to initiate the invasion. Their equipment, their panzers, no, their very being was superior to the cheerful ponies. They denied the hive what was rightfully theirs, but soon, the swarm would punch through the pony lines and the voice of Harmony would be silenced forever.
