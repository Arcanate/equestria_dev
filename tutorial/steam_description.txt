[h1]Equestria at War[/h1] is a mod that tries to recreate the fantasy world of Equestria from My Little Pony franchise in a slightly darker setting with industrialization, corruption and political disagreements. The scenario focuses on global confrontation between Changelings and Equestria.

[h1]“Pax Chrysalia” 1.7.7[/h1]

Equestria is over. The Changelings have won. The Queendom, victorious but overstretched, begin carving up their new territories into Commissariats and Protectorates. The Hegemony stands poised on the edge of an era of peace and prosperity — the Pax Chrysalia — but for the moment, Chrysalis has extended to the breaking point of her reach.

For those soldiers of the Changeling Heer stationed across Equestria, tasked with occupying the vast continental interior, the fighting is far from over. Of the shattered remnants of Celestia's soldiers, those too loyal or naive to stand down now regroup as the guerillas and partisans of the Harmonic Resistance. Having survived their earlier defeats to live and fight another day, these battle-hardened stalwarts of the antebellum will prove to be a tenacious thorn in the changelings' side.

But as far as Vesalipolis is concerned, the Great War had ended with the total and utter victory of the Queendom. Though the ruins of Equestria's cities have yet to stop smouldering, it is quickly becoming impolitic to speak candidly of the threats facing the Pax Chrysalia. With the uppermost echelons of the Hives jostling amongst themselves for the favour of Queen Chrysalis, the soldier-bureaucrats charged with keeping the Queen's peace must walk a fine line between caution and decisiveness if they are to finesse the challenges facing the new world order from within and without.
